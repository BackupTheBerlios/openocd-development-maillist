<PRE>Hi Tomek,

I have zero prior experience with the FT2232 so I took a very brief scan of
its driver code.  I get the feeling that this type of device allows fairly
low-level access to interface port pins.  If this is true I can see the
logic behind a bitbang function as this provides the generic abstraction
layer between any arbitrary signal name and its corresponding underlying
hardware I/O pin. In theory you can make this type of device sing with just
about anything.

Unfortunately I suspect a lot of dongles from different vendors may not have
this type of low-level capability.  The jlink device (at least from an
official Segger published protocol standpoint) basically allows the host to
select one of 32 different types of interfaces through the EMU_CMD_SELECT_IF
command.  Right now the only two interfaces supported are JTAG and SWD,
however.  It also allows transfer of data through the EMU_CMD_HW_JTAG3 and
EMU_CMD_HW_JTAG_WRITE commands.  The effect of the second and third command
on the physical hardware depends on the mode set using the first command.

The transfer function on the other hand looks cursorily like it can be
implemented with the EMU_CMD_HW_JTAG3 command on jlink.  Since I really have
not studied libswd in any depth what happens if a particular dongle can only
support the basic transfer but no bitbang command with respect to libswd?

Like I indicated in the beginning, I only took a very superficial look at
this, so I may be be missing information or other critical details.  Feel
free to chime in with perspective or correct any of my assumptions.

Gary
