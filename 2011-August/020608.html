<PRE>If we don't constantly show that some work has been done by
open-source some people will tend to think it was done for free, no
effort and they start to demand more results with less funds in
shorter time. This is why we should tell to develop open-source
instead buy expensive closed solutions-per-problem because investing
in open-source in fact can bring better results with smaller cost...
Creating open-source is not free and it is time consuming. Some people
does not understand this fact.

If some laboratory or company use closed source solutions but for some
reason they want use open-source they cannot at the same time block
support for open-source, or they should consequently purchase
_everything_ commercial and closed source and even don't touch the
open-source to see how bad things will get with their work and funding
:<i>-) Closed source applications are also full of bugs and limited
</I>functionalities. There is nothing good with that except you get
working solution instantly... but you cannot change or develop it
anyway.

If anyone wants to use additional channels of FTDI I would recommend
creating that support in open-source rather than mix open-source with
proprietary stuff. The same with transfer efficiency and everything
else. People start to integrate open-source in their commercial
products with nothing in return. This is not fair and we should not
support such actions. This is why I fully support decision to give
preference for open-source libftdi rather than libftd2xx (please not
that there is no libftd2xx for my system).

Best regards :-)
Tomek
