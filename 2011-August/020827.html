</I>&gt;<i>     Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     In attempting to use openocd with an Amontec JTAG key to program a
</I>&gt;<i>     Xilinx FPGA, I encountered a series of issues I though others
</I>&gt;<i>     might be interested in. I don't have sensible proposed solutions
</I>&gt;<i>     for any of the problems I encountered, but perhaps someone on this
</I>&gt;<i>     mailing list is interested all the same.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The SVF file is a few SVF commands, with one very large SDR
</I>&gt;<i>     command in the middle; something like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         SDR 27025501 TDI (00000000800000008000 ... ) SMASK (1fffffff ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     This was generated by some Xilinx tools I believe. The file was
</I>&gt;<i>     roughly 13MB large, most of which was this one SDR command.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The first problem is that openocd failed to read the SVF file;
</I>&gt;<i>     with the error message:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         buffer is not enough, report to author
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Not sure which author this is talking about, so I thought I'd
</I>&gt;<i>     inspect the code. And so the saga began...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     This code here is within an &quot;#if 1&quot; clause, the &quot;#else&quot; looks like
</I>&gt;<i>     it had code to dynamically allocate enough memory for the command.
</I>&gt;<i>     Unfortunately, just changing the &quot;#if 1&quot; to an &quot;#if 0&quot; was not
</I>&gt;<i>     enough - I tried this once I got things working and ended up with
</I>&gt;<i>     strange TDO check errors. Hence I ended up just making the static
</I>&gt;<i>     buffer size large enough for my needs (16MB).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     On it's own, this isn't quite enough: the data gets copied into
</I>&gt;<i>     some sort of &quot;command&quot; object allocated in cmd_queue_alloc(). I
</I>&gt;<i>     patched this code to handle allocating sizes of &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     CMD_QUEUE_PAGE_SIZE; without this I got a segfault in memcpy() as
</I>&gt;<i>     there is an un-checked memcpy() into the memory on this command.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     At this point, openocd no longer crashes with my SVF file.
</I>&gt;<i>     Unfortunately I started hitting USB/FTDI errors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Using the open source libftdi (version 0.17) driver I get the
</I>&gt;<i>     following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Error: ftdi_write_data: usb bulk write failed
</I>&gt;<i>         Error: couldn't write MPSSE commands to FT2232
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Digging into this some more, I found the error was -110 (ETIMEDOUT).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Using instead the libftd2xx binary driver, I got:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Error: couldn't read enough bytes from FT2232 device (2 &lt; 3)
</I>&gt;<i>         Error: couldn't read from FT2232
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Giving up on that and going back to the libftdi driver, I found
</I>&gt;<i>     the following mailing list thread, which suggested that the buffer
</I>&gt;<i>     size was too large:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         <A HREF="../2009-February/004695.html">http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2009-February/004695.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Reducing this buffer size to 768 (from 128K!) did not immediately
</I>&gt;<i>     fix the problem at all. Instead I got:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         openocd: ft2232.c:403: buffer_write: Assertion `(unsigned)
</I>&gt;<i>         ft2232_buffer_size &lt; (unsigned) 768' failed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I dug into the ft2232_large_scan() function and found this line
</I>&gt;<i>     which looks like it attempts to do 64K writes at a time:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             thisrun_bytes = (num_bytes &gt; 65537) ? 65536 : (num_bytes - 1);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Changing the 64K in that line to instead use 768 made no
</I>&gt;<i>     difference. I tried 512. This worked; no more assertion. I don't
</I>&gt;<i>     have justification for why I needed 512 here
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The same logic is in ft2232_add_scan so I guess it works in &quot;normal&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> cases.
</I>
Yes. I should point out that if I remove the large SDR, or use SVF for 
other purposes, it works just fine for me. It is purely the large SDR 
command that is breaking things.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     At this stage I got the libftdi driver giving the same error
</I>&gt;<i>     message as the libftd2xx driver: trying to read 3 bytes, only got
</I>&gt;<i>     2 bytes. This seemed like progress so I moved on to diagnosing
</I>&gt;<i>     this error.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I guessed it was just an off-by-one error, and found the following
</I>&gt;<i>     lines, which looked suspicious:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         if (type != SCAN_OUT)
</I>&gt;<i>             thisrun_read += 1;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I commented these two lines out, with again no basis other than
</I>&gt;<i>     guess-work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ft2322_large_scan is broken to the point where I've doubt that it's 
</I>&gt;<i> ever used in practice. I could never get it to run using a CPU target, 
</I>&gt;<i> but with a 27 Mb scan from an SVF file I guess it will. Thanks for the 
</I>&gt;<i> idea, I didn't think of that. From your description it seems your SDR 
</I>&gt;<i> is an inout scan? One problem with ft2232_large_scan is that, as far 
</I>&gt;<i> as I can tell, the data read back is completely discarded. Maybe the 
</I>&gt;<i> SVF code doesn't support TDO verification, because I doubt it would 
</I>&gt;<i> work. Also there's a memory leak, buffer's never getting free'd.
</I>Actually, this SDR is out only; purely sending data to program an FPGA 
and not expecting anything back.

TDO verification does work for &quot;small&quot; commands at least; I use this to 
check the FPGA is programmed correctly in a later command and the 
verification appears to work just fine (i.e. I've seen the verify raise 
an error when it should).
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The ftdi driver is a real mess. I've been trying to clean in up the 
</I>&gt;<i> past days but I'm beginning to think a complete rewrite would be better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>That may be the best solution...

I've also found that with my patch, if I try and run the SVF file twice, 
openocd crashes with a malloc error, so I certainly haven't got the code 
running perfectly.

If you do go ahead with such, I'd be happy to test your code if that is 
helpful.

Cheers,
Sam
