Sure thing this is why asked you what API design would fit best the
high-level interfaces still to be common to low-level interfaces :-)

Also think that using low-level libraries on high-level interface will
allow to use transports that this interface does not support :-) This
is why I created transfer and bitbang, but they are only implemented
for FT2232 at the moment, I want to work out the RLink but I am
critically overloaded with work so I will get to that probably in
October  :-)


&gt;<i> Ideally from my perspective the best solution would be to have each dongle
</I>&gt;<i> -- regardless of the manufacturer -- behave like a high-level device at the
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD driver level using a common unified API that enumerates what
</I>&gt;<i> capabilities it supports but leaving each driver to decide how to handle
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;bit-blasting&quot; activities under the hood. &#160;In the case of a high-level
</I>&gt;<i> device like jlink, most of the driver code would provide pass-thru +
</I>&gt;<i> necessary glue logic (pretty much what it does now). &#160;For low-level devices,
</I>&gt;<i> this could call on existing libraries like libswd or even new ones for
</I>&gt;<i> future transports.
</I>
At the moment there was only jtag_interface structure that had
execute() function performing data flush from jtag command queue into
hardware in a manner specific to a hardware. This is jtag only and
leaves no other option for other transports except we create
execite_jtag() execute_swd() and other functions that will flush data
from transport specific queue. This would result in having separate
subsystem for each transport, which is messy, and that was the reason
I have created generic transport and bitbang functions that can be
used by any transport or tcl function. Each interface should have this
implemented anyway. This way we only need to create small module for
transport that would act as bridge between openocd_target and
hardware_target.


&gt;<i> The question is how to do this without making a mess in existing code
</I>&gt;<i> currently heavily-invested in jtag. &#160;I think whatever the API looks like
</I>&gt;<i> needs to maintain backward compatibility with the existing approach by
</I>&gt;<i> either providing a superset-based API or alternatively support both a legacy
</I>&gt;<i> and advanced API.
</I>
See above :-) I try to be as less invasive as possible but the current
design is already messy and not easily extensible :-P The OpenOCD
needs general restructurization and cleanup by diviging code into
clean modules using common API you are right. I have given this task
some months but it was too much work so I suspended it, I can take
care of it after SWD if working because this is my main goal at the
moment :-) We should use one common context and divide code into
modules responsible for specific tasks like interface, transport,
target, flash, cpu, os, core, etc. Now all this seems to be put in one
place, so it needs really dedicated  piece of work :-)


&gt;<i> Since you have spent a lot more time thinking about this then I have, what
</I>&gt;<i> is your ideal API scheme in light of the various realities mentioned above?
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't fiddled in the bowels of OpenOCD much outside the driver level so
</I>&gt;<i> my ideas may have other problems when tested against reality.
</I>
The transfer and bitbang allows some basic routines to work on the bus
between interface and target DAP/TAP therefore I think all interfaces
should have this obligatory, maybe not efficient (i.e. one bit per
command, or no bitbang at all if interface sets directions
automaticaly), but this would allow some fallback into working
solution with all future OpenOCD functionalities, not only limited to
those provided by interface logic/commandset. This dedicated
functionalities would be interface specific and will provide superior
efficiency compared to this generic stuff of course. I would have to
take a look at example command set of high-level interface command
set, maybe there is some tutorial on this?


Best regards :-)
Tomek
