</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In attempting to use openocd with an Amontec JTAG key to program a Xilinx
</I>&gt;<i> FPGA, I encountered a series of issues I though others might be interested
</I>&gt;<i> in. I don't have sensible proposed solutions for any of the problems I
</I>&gt;<i> encountered, but perhaps someone on this mailing list is interested all the
</I>&gt;<i> same.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The SVF file is a few SVF commands, with one very large SDR command in the
</I>&gt;<i> middle; something like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SDR 27025501 TDI (00000000800000008000 ... ) SMASK (1fffffff ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This was generated by some Xilinx tools I believe. The file was roughly
</I>&gt;<i> 13MB large, most of which was this one SDR command.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The first problem is that openocd failed to read the SVF file; with the
</I>&gt;<i> error message:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> buffer is not enough, report to author
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure which author this is talking about, so I thought I'd inspect the
</I>&gt;<i> code. And so the saga began...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This code here is within an &quot;#if 1&quot; clause, the &quot;#else&quot; looks like it had
</I>&gt;<i> code to dynamically allocate enough memory for the command. Unfortunately,
</I>&gt;<i> just changing the &quot;#if 1&quot; to an &quot;#if 0&quot; was not enough - I tried this once I
</I>&gt;<i> got things working and ended up with strange TDO check errors. Hence I ended
</I>&gt;<i> up just making the static buffer size large enough for my needs (16MB).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On it's own, this isn't quite enough: the data gets copied into some sort
</I>&gt;<i> of &quot;command&quot; object allocated in cmd_queue_alloc(). I patched this code to
</I>&gt;<i> handle allocating sizes of &gt; CMD_QUEUE_PAGE_SIZE; without this I got a
</I>&gt;<i> segfault in memcpy() as there is an un-checked memcpy() into the memory on
</I>&gt;<i> this command.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At this point, openocd no longer crashes with my SVF file. Unfortunately I
</I>&gt;<i> started hitting USB/FTDI errors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Using the open source libftdi (version 0.17) driver I get the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Error: ftdi_write_data: usb bulk write failed
</I>&gt;<i> Error: couldn't write MPSSE commands to FT2232
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Digging into this some more, I found the error was -110 (ETIMEDOUT).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Using instead the libftd2xx binary driver, I got:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Error: couldn't read enough bytes from FT2232 device (2 &lt; 3)
</I>&gt;<i> Error: couldn't read from FT2232
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Giving up on that and going back to the libftdi driver, I found the
</I>&gt;<i> following mailing list thread, which suggested that the buffer size was too
</I>&gt;<i> large:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="../2009-February/004695.html">http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2009-February/004695.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Reducing this buffer size to 768 (from 128K!) did not immediately fix the
</I>&gt;<i> problem at all. Instead I got:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> openocd: ft2232.c:403: buffer_write: Assertion `(unsigned)
</I>&gt;<i> ft2232_buffer_size &lt; (unsigned) 768' failed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I dug into the ft2232_large_scan() function and found this line which looks
</I>&gt;<i> like it attempts to do 64K writes at a time:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>        thisrun_bytes = (num_bytes &gt; 65537) ? 65536 : (num_bytes - 1);
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Changing the 64K in that line to instead use 768 made no difference. I
</I>&gt;<i> tried 512. This worked; no more assertion. I don't have justification for
</I>&gt;<i> why I needed 512 here
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The same logic is in ft2232_add_scan so I guess it works in &quot;normal&quot; cases.

At this stage I got the libftdi driver giving the same error message as the
&gt;<i> libftd2xx driver: trying to read 3 bytes, only got 2 bytes. This seemed like
</I>&gt;<i> progress so I moved on to diagnosing this error.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guessed it was just an off-by-one error, and found the following lines,
</I>&gt;<i> which looked suspicious:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> if (type != SCAN_OUT)
</I>&gt;<i>     thisrun_read += 1;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I commented these two lines out, with again no basis other than guess-work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
ft2322_large_scan is broken to the point where I've doubt that it's ever
used in practice. I could never get it to run using a CPU target, but with a
27 Mb scan from an SVF file I guess it will. Thanks for the idea, I didn't
think of that. From your description it seems your SDR is an inout scan? One
problem with ft2232_large_scan is that, as far as I can tell, the data read
back is completely discarded. Maybe the SVF code doesn't support TDO
verification, because I doubt it would work. Also there's a memory leak,
buffer's never getting free'd.


&gt;<i> The ftdi driver is a real mess. I've been trying to clean in up the past
</I>days but I'm beginning to think a complete rewrite would be better.
