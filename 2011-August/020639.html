</I>All patches should be tested on the latest upstream before merge,
shouldn't it? If we follow this rule, we can keep the linear history
and know the patch has been tested just on the HEAD before it's
committed. The commit they were tested against when they were being
developed is not so important then. The developer, who develops the
patches, might still want to remember that commit to debug bugs in his
patches found later, but others can always make sure those patches
have been tested on the HEAD when they are committed.

For example, one developer has a branch which was branched off from
upstream one month ago and asks for merging the branch to the
upstream. But during the past month, something might have changed in
upstream, which would cause break after merging his branch into the
upstream. Tested against a one-month old commit does not guarantee
that it should work as expected after merge. The developer surely
should rebase his branch to the current HEAD of master to resolve any
issues and do a testing to make sure his branch works as correctly on
the current HEAD before ask for a pull to merge.

I would like a clean, atomic, linear history in the upstream.

Jie
