<PRE>Hello,

In attempting to use openocd with an Amontec JTAG key to program a 
Xilinx FPGA, I encountered a series of issues I though others might be 
interested in. I don't have sensible proposed solutions for any of the 
problems I encountered, but perhaps someone on this mailing list is 
interested all the same.

The SVF file is a few SVF commands, with one very large SDR command in 
the middle; something like:

    SDR 27025501 TDI (00000000800000008000 ... ) SMASK (1fffffff ...

This was generated by some Xilinx tools I believe. The file was roughly 
13MB large, most of which was this one SDR command.

The first problem is that openocd failed to read the SVF file; with the 
error message:

    buffer is not enough, report to author

Not sure which author this is talking about, so I thought I'd inspect 
the code. And so the saga began...

This code here is within an &quot;#if 1&quot; clause, the &quot;#else&quot; looks like it 
had code to dynamically allocate enough memory for the command. 
Unfortunately, just changing the &quot;#if 1&quot; to an &quot;#if 0&quot; was not enough - 
I tried this once I got things working and ended up with strange TDO 
check errors. Hence I ended up just making the static buffer size large 
enough for my needs (16MB).

On it's own, this isn't quite enough: the data gets copied into some 
sort of &quot;command&quot; object allocated in cmd_queue_alloc(). I patched this 
code to handle allocating sizes of &gt; CMD_QUEUE_PAGE_SIZE; without this I 
got a segfault in memcpy() as there is an un-checked memcpy() into the 
memory on this command.

At this point, openocd no longer crashes with my SVF file. Unfortunately 
I started hitting USB/FTDI errors.

Using the open source libftdi (version 0.17) driver I get the following:

    Error: ftdi_write_data: usb bulk write failed
    Error: couldn't write MPSSE commands to FT2232

Digging into this some more, I found the error was -110 (ETIMEDOUT).

Using instead the libftd2xx binary driver, I got:

    Error: couldn't read enough bytes from FT2232 device (2 &lt; 3)
    Error: couldn't read from FT2232

Giving up on that and going back to the libftdi driver, I found the 
following mailing list thread, which suggested that the buffer size was 
too large:

    <A HREF="../2009-February/004695.html">http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2009-February/004695.html</A>

Reducing this buffer size to 768 (from 128K!) did not immediately fix 
the problem at all. Instead I got:

    openocd: ft2232.c:403: buffer_write: Assertion `(unsigned)
    ft2232_buffer_size &lt; (unsigned) 768' failed.

I dug into the ft2232_large_scan() function and found this line which 
looks like it attempts to do 64K writes at a time:

         thisrun_bytes = (num_bytes &gt; 65537) ? 65536 : (num_bytes - 1);

Changing the 64K in that line to instead use 768 made no difference. I 
tried 512. This worked; no more assertion. I don't have justification 
for why I needed 512 here.

At this stage I got the libftdi driver giving the same error message as 
the libftd2xx driver: trying to read 3 bytes, only got 2 bytes. This 
seemed like progress so I moved on to diagnosing this error.

I guessed it was just an off-by-one error, and found the following 
lines, which looked suspicious:

    if (type != SCAN_OUT)
         thisrun_read += 1;

I commented these two lines out, with again no basis other than guess-work.

Now it worked perfectly.

The patch to make all this work in the end was rather small; see attached.

Regards,
Sam
