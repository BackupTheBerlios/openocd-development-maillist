</I>&gt;<i> &quot;whatever is wrong (in OpenOCD) is probably minor&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
After piles of debugging today, I have determined that command 0x09 is
EMU_CMD_REGISTER, which is undocumented in the J-Link USB Protocol
manual. I don't know what parameters it sends or what data it
receives. In addition, there are plenty of commands from the
Capabilities table that are undocumented: EMU_CMD_RAWTRACE,
EMU_CMD_TEST_NET_SPEED, EMU_CMD_INDICATORS, EMU_CMD_REGISTER,
EMU_CMD_FILE_IO, EMU_CMD_UPDATE_FIRMWARE_EX, EMU_CMD_WRITE_DCC_EX,
EMU_CMD_SWO, and EMU_CMD_READ_DCC.

Regarding OpenOCD's J-Link initialiation sequence, I was going to
start trying some things out, changing the order of some commands to
make it more like Segger's, adding some of the missing ones (like
EMU_CMD_GET_COUNTERS; Segger uses it, but I don't think OpenOCD does).
I also noticed that where the usb_bulk_reads start to fail is when we
start to issue EMU_CMD_HW_JTAG3; from Xiaofan's log above:
Debug: 277 507 core.c:329 jtag_call_event_callbacks(): jtag event: TAP reset
Debug: 278 510 jlink.c:1654 jlink_debug_buffer(): 0000 cf 00 07 00 7f 00
Debug: 279 511 jlink.c:1654 jlink_debug_buffer(): 0000 7f
Debug: 280 514 jlink.c:1654 jlink_debug_buffer(): 0000 00
Debug: 281 514 core.c:1435 jtag_init_inner(): Init JTAG chain
Debug: 282 514 core.c:329 jtag_call_event_callbacks(): jtag event: TAP reset
Debug: 283 515 jlink.c:1654 jlink_debug_buffer(): 0000 cf 00 07 00 7f 00
Error: 284 518 jlink.c:1504 jlink_usb_message(): usb_bulk_read failed
(requested=1, result=0)
Error: 285 518 jlink.c:1367 jlink_tap_execute(): jlink_tap_execute,
wrong result -107 (expected 1)

Odd that the command succeeds, but sending the very same command again
fails. I had a hunch that perhaps it's a data length thing in the V8
firmware. All of Segger's EMU_CMD_HW_JTAG3 commands are on the order
of 194 bytes long, and we are sending command sequences that are less
than 8 bits. There's already some funky behavior noted in the code for
when J-Link returns an extra NULL when the incoming message size is a
multiple of 64. It wouldn't be unprecedented, but I haven't
investigated it yet.

Well, that's a day's work for me.

~Eric
