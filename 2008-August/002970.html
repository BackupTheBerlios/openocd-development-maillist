<PRE>Hi all,

On Tue, Aug 19, 2008 at 3:56 PM, &#216;yvind Harboe &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">oyvind.harboe at zylin.com</A>&gt; wrote:
&gt;<i> I've committed this patch, even if it is work in progress, as
</I>&gt;<i> there are also other changes to jtag.c going on at this time
</I>&gt;<i> and synchronizing work takes priority.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I have given it a try, I cann connect with gdb, however I have further
error later, telling me that the &quot;target has not been examined yet&quot;.
Is this a problem that is going to cause bad behavior with gdb ? Is
this what you mean Oyvind when you say the patch is work in progress ?

Here is the beginning of the log I get with using the gdbinit script
Alan sent me for i.MX31

Alan: has this script worked for you with openocd ? You had asked me a
while ago, but I only have had time to test it yesterday evening.
Oyvind: I think there are a lot of other things that need to be fixed
in jtag.c so that the bad i.MX31 jtag chain can be supported (the
target not examined yet error for instance) ? Is it worth doing it now
or should we wait for Duane to have progressed in his changes ?

Regards

Valentin
