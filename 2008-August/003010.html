I can reproduce that, but I have some more problems to add. My setup is:
 - Luminary RDK-IDM board, with a LM3S6918 CPU.
   <A HREF="http://www.luminarymicro.com/products/rdk-idm.html">http://www.luminarymicro.com/products/rdk-idm.html</A>
 - openocd from svn head (pulled some weeks ago)
 - parallel port wiggler2 adapter

I have tried two possible configurations: 
target cortex_m3 little 0 lm3s
and
target cortex_m3 little 0

Both show different behaviour, but none of the two yields a fully working setup.

Using &quot;target cortex_m3 little 0 lm3s&quot; (which I assume should be the right one for the CPU) I can reset the CPU and erase/program the flash. However, both &quot;reset run&quot; and &quot;reset halt&quot; followed by &quot;resume&quot; do *not* run the program in flash. OpenOCD thinks the target is running, but nothing happens on the display or serial port.

Using &quot;target cortex_m3 little 0&quot;, &quot;reset run&quot;, &quot;resume&quot;, singlestepping etc. work fine. However, if the flash is erased, reset halt does not get control of the chip, and I can't re-program the flash. In that situation, I have to switch to the &quot;lm3s&quot; config which *can* program the flash, but is useless for debugging/running the application.

Using both configuration variants, most of the time, the first flash command fails as described above, while a second try succeeds. This is annoying, but not really critical.

Using both configuration variants, I am not able to reset the CPU directly out of reset - the program runs several commands before openocd gains control of the target, which may also cause the problems when the flash is empty.

I have attached -d3 logs of both configuration cases, with an application in flash, as well as one variant of my rdk-idm.cfg.
