</I>
If the target can not be examined, then basically communication isn't working.

It is possible to connect GDB to OpenOCD when the target is powered down.

The first test is to connect w/Telnet and to test the following (ordered by
difficulty in getting them to work):

- reset run
- reset halt
- examine registers to see that they are sane
- reset init
- examine  &amp; modify memory
- halt/resume

Once you have the above working, you can think about trying to get GDB to work.


&gt;<i> Alan: has this script worked for you with openocd ? You had asked me a
</I>&gt;<i> while ago, but I only have had time to test it yesterday evening.
</I>&gt;<i> Oyvind: I think there are a lot of other things that need to be fixed

</I>
Do not wait for Duane. We'll handle any merging + we pretty much know
what his changes are going to be at this point.

Submit patches against latest version of trunk.
