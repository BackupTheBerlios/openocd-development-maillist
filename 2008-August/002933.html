First, remember this:  OpenOCD uses JIM TCL - which is not &quot;Main Stream 
Tcl/Tk&quot;.
JimTCL can be embedded in a &quot;rom&quot; target - something main stream Tcl/TK 
cannot do.
This 'embedded feature' is some what helpful for some users of OpenOCD.

Jason&gt; Are you doing some special pre-processing before passing it to 
TCL so that openocd-specific commands don't need the semicolon (to 
maintain backward compatibility?)

There are some odd things happening, if JimTCL does not recognize a 
command - an &quot;unknown&quot; function is called - which then tries to execute 
the old commands using the &quot;openocd&quot; rules.

As you can see this has created a nasty &quot;two headed monster&quot; which is at 
times - problematic.

jason&gt; There seems to be a mishmash of conventions:
jason&gt; set i 8;   # This works
jason&gt; set i 8    # Does not work
jason&gt; poll;   # This works
jason&gt; poll   # This also works

Yea, because &quot;set&quot; is a TCL command, and &quot;poll&quot; is a OpenOCD command 
that still exists in the old way of doing things.
Today - we gave a monster with two heads.

jason&gt; Multiple line if and while statements don't work like they do in 
tclsh. 

First remember: Repeating the above -  Jim/TCL - is not MainStream TCL ...

Second: While I don't see a fix anytime soon - I do think the current 
action is a *BUG* - it should have given some type of syntax error. In 
many ways, a human typed command is thought to be &quot;completely self 
contained on the single line&quot;.

One day - perhaps all the old OpenOCD commands will become JIM ... and 
JIM will handle raw user input - and then multi-line typed commands will 
work.

You can however, put your functions in a &quot;foo.tcl&quot; and &quot;source foo.tcl&quot; 
instead.
