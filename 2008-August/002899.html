<PRE>Hi,

the OpenOCD contains support for some controllers with NAND interfaces, but 
the AT91SAM9260 isn't currently supported. I looked into this once, but 
SAM-BA is so easy to use, I didn't bother working on OpenOCD support for the 
SAM9s.

There's a Linux version of SAM-BA (I never used the Windows version, but the 
screenshots look similar):
<A HREF="http://www.linux4sam.org/twiki/bin/view/Linux4SAM/SoftwareTools#SAM_BA_Linux_initiative">http://www.linux4sam.org/twiki/bin/view/Linux4SAM/SoftwareTools#SAM_BA_Linux_initiative</A>

I managed to erase the NAND flash (didn't have anything to put in it, but I 
guess loading would work, too) and I'm regularly programming the serial data 
flash.

Regards,

Dominic

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Looks like you had the internal SRAM mapped to 0x0 at that point. Check
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the processors user's manual for information about its internal memories
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and mappings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had a closer look at the at91sam9260 datasheet.
</I>&gt;<i> On my board the code at the beginning of the NAND flash is loaded (thus
</I>&gt;<i> copied) to the internal SRAM at 0x300000.
</I>&gt;<i> Once the code has been loaded, the internal SRAM gets remapped to
</I>&gt;<i> address 0x0 and the CPU core can start to boot.
</I>&gt;<i> For this reason I was able to replace the code at this address region
</I>&gt;<i> (SRAM instead of NAND flash) and it's clear now why the changes to this
</I>&gt;<i> region were only temporary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, to be able to actually program the board, I would need write
</I>&gt;<i> access to NAND memory.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is, like you already said, that NAND isn't memory mapped:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; NAND flash has completely different characteristics, e.g. it isn't memory
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mapped.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, is there a possibility to write to the NAND flash on my board ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> According to the datasheet, &quot;the NAND flash logic is driven by the
</I>&gt;<i> Static Memory Controller on the NCS3 address space. ...
</I>&gt;<i>                       Access to an external NANDFlash device is then
</I>&gt;<i> made by accessing the address space reserved to NCS3 (i.e., between
</I>&gt;<i> 0x4000 0000 and 0x4FFF
</I>&gt;<i> FFFF).&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, in my understanding, if the at91sam9260 is initialized so that the
</I>&gt;<i> according output pins are used for NAND flash, the whole NAND flash
</I>&gt;<i> memory should be memory mapped by the static memory controller.
</I>&gt;<i> For this reason all I would have to do is to write to this memory region
</I>&gt;<i>   provided that the at91sam9260 is initialized with NAND flash support.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After reading through some examples, I found out that I can actually
</I>&gt;<i> create scripts which are executed after reset.
</I>&gt;<i> For this reason, I could initialize the memory controller so that it
</I>&gt;<i> memory maps the NAND flash.
</I>&gt;<i> After that I could write to NAND, true ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Besides openocd, there is an atmel programming tool that can do flash
</I>&gt;<i> programming with the SMA-BA boot agent residing in the cores ROM.
</I>&gt;<i> However, the tool only runs on windows which would be kind of cumbersome
</I>&gt;<i> for me since my whole development environment runs under linux.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you know of any other (linux) solution I could use to program the
</I>&gt;<i> NAND flash ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Like I said, the at91sam9260 has boot code in ROM (SAM-BA) that can be
</I>&gt;<i> used to write to memory regions.
</I>&gt;<i> But since SAM-BA doesn't know that there's NAND flash attached, I'm
</I>&gt;<i> pretty sure that it doesn't initialize the memory controller.
</I>&gt;<i> According to the datasheet, one can upload files over the serial/USB
</I>&gt;<i> port using the xmodem protocol.
</I>&gt;<i> But if the memory controller is not initialized to support NAND flash,
</I>&gt;<i> that won't be of much help either.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How do you guys program your ARM based boards ?
</I>&gt;<i> They most possibly also have their code in NAND flash, haven't they ?
