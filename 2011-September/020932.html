Hello Sven :-) This is why I suggested reorganization of source code
to be more modular not jtag cntric and this is why transport layers is
introduced :-)


&gt;<i> I wrote my own driver for a SWD test. With this driver I can
</I>&gt;<i> successfully read and write memory and control the core of a LPC1343 via
</I>&gt;<i> openocd. For the moment it's a proof of concept driver. It's not as fast
</I>&gt;<i> as I expected. Each transfer over usb hardware needs about 10ms. Next, I
</I>&gt;<i> will try libusb instead of cdc-acm implementation.
</I>
You can design high-level API for high-level drivers, this is highly
wanted at the moment, but let it be compatible with current swd work
plz :-)

&gt;<i> I had a closer look to your fork from openocd. In my opinion it's not a
</I>&gt;<i> good idea doing the SWD bit disassembling in the transport layer. If you
</I>&gt;<i> do this, the driver has no chance to optimise the performance. It has to
</I>&gt;<i> be synchronous with the hardware. This means you write the 8 bit SWD
</I>&gt;<i> header, then you read the 3 bit ack. With the value of the ack you can
</I>&gt;<i> decide what to do. You need at least 4 USB transfers.
</I>
Take a closer look at queue mechanism in libswd - packets can be added
with ENQUEUE and EXECUTE, so if the readback is necessary user pass
EXECUTE otherwise ENQUEUE to minimalise traffic all queue is flushed
at EXECUTE.


&gt;<i> I think the driver should have the choice whether using you library or
</I>&gt;<i> not. In my proof of concept driver I send the whole command queue to the
</I>&gt;<i> uC with one USB transfer.
</I>
See above :-) Not all drivers must use libswd it was created to
generate full bistream, however high level drivers, such as JLink
according to the documentation also don't know the swd contructs
itself so they propably also need to use lbswd. The problem you are
describing is the efficiency problem no the API and it can be easily
solved with EXECUTE/ENQUEUE.


&gt;<i> What do you think about the extension of the command queue? I attached a
</I>&gt;<i> patch file. The swd transport implementation sends one or more commands
</I>&gt;<i> (ADI_AP_READ, ADI_AP_WRITE, ADI_DP_READ and ADI_DP_WRITE) through the
</I>&gt;<i> existing queue and then calls jtag_execute_queue. The driver can decide
</I>&gt;<i> if using the SWD library or not. In case of the ft2232 the library must
</I>&gt;<i> be used. But for higher performances the debug hardware should implement
</I>&gt;<i> the low level SWD protocol.
</I>
Uhm, this is more complicated and I have tried that way already and it
failed, the current command queue is jtag centric and it depicts
alternative way to using libswd and transport layer itself because it
works on central queue not transport itself, so it will bring problems
in future and make extensions harder to implement and integrate. I
would rahter see driver to decide. Transport can be implemented as
separate library (i.e. libswd) that can be used among other
applications also can be implemented in hardware interfaces, but it
should provide common api to the higher layers and no ingerention into
higher layers should be made. The transport provide ap/dp_read/write
functions in the namespace after transport initialization, in future I
would see this part of big openocd context, but leaving internal queue
for its own purposes.

I can see following program structure:
1. Board
2. Target (i.e. adi_v5)
3. Transport (i.e. swd)
4. Interface Driver (i.e. ft2232, jlink,rlink, ...)

Target calls the transport_ap/dp_read/write functions defined by
transport layer and this performs operations on internal queue to be
then flushed into driver using standard function set (char array
read/write that it interface specific, single pin bitbang must be
hardware dependent but must provide common api to the upper layers). I
am working already in this direction and lots have been done (both in
considerations and programming).

I haven't seen a cable where u can ask it to perform AP_READ, but even
if such cable exist we need better integration between transport and
driver layer. Each element of the libswd queue has its type (a
quantific designator for swd operation such as ack, request, data,
parity, trn, ...). In this case we dond neet to place command payload
only the information about the command, this is where your idea on
queueing comes into action. I think we should place it in transport
layer queue, because when we put it above then we can ommit the
transport layer and so the program structure breaks down...

I have provided void * witihin each &quot;transfer&quot; and &quot;bitbang&quot; driver
members prototype, so a pointer to a transport queue can be passed and
data can be analyzed in a way specific to a driver, not necessairly to
read/write char array:

int ft2232_transfer(void *device, int bits, char *mosidata, char
*misodata, int nLSBfirst);

As you can see this opens a door for dumb-forward-drivers such as
ft2232 that needs to get payload to transfer, also for
high-level-intelligent drivers that does not need to know the payload
but only the command (also the command needs parameters so the payload
is important) so the universal access with void * is provided. I would
rather use it this way. The program structure is very important, for
readability and extensibility in future with functionalities we now
cannot predict (just as it was jtag centric and it was hard to
implement swd). This organization is clean and elegant I think. When
we start to mess transport beyond transport there is no need for
transport :-)

Also the description presented above can be the common API for bith
high-level and low-level drivers..? I have already implemented this in
dumb-driver ft2232 and also plan to do it with high-level rlink
interface but there sooo many tasks on my head, it needs some time and
I need a vacation ;-P


Best regards! :-)
