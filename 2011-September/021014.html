<PRE>Hello everyone!

I am a first-year, MSc student studying computer engineering. The
subject of my thesis is analyzing test code coverege on a Cortex-M3
processor.
In order to do this I intend to use the SWO trace-port of the
Cortex-M3 processor.
To use the SWO output, the processor must be set into SWD mode,
because it shares a pin with the JTAG interface.

My first task would be to analyze and present trace data to the user,
but later on the goal would be to program up the trace peripheral
through SWD, and test code coverage *without* using any kind of extra
code downloaded to the microcontroller.
For this I would need something that supports the SWD protocol and
debugging of course, as I don't intent to rewrite it from scratch.

That was a kind of long introduction, but now for my question: How
does SWD support stand in openocd? The information I found over the
lists are contradictory and not quite clear. As far as I understand,
there is a working adapter named versaloon, which is also ARM-based?
My hardware would use an FT2232 chip (layout similar to oocdlink), so
if the transport layer is ready, I would be happy to write a driver
for it, if you can give me a few pointers where and how to start.

Currently my main need would be to use SWD to access the internal
memory bus, and read/write data.

I would be happy to contribute as much as I can to openocd, and I'd
love to see trace support integrated into openocd. (Won't need to
occupy a serial port for &quot;printf&quot;-s, and other useful data could be
retrieved, something similar to: Switched to task &quot;EventTask&quot; at
2394nS etc.)

Regards,
  &#193;kos Vandra
