My 2 cents worth:

I would also suggest to anyone that designs a new generation FTDI based interface that a target voltage monitor be added (a simple comparator may do) to report if the target is switched off/not powered, before attempting JTAG comms.

Best regards,
Pieter

Yes.  I believe they also support RTCK which will make JTAG speed
selection much easier if your target also supports it.  Someone just
needs to build a board using the ft2232h and then work with the
libftdi project to get MPSSE support working on it.  Then we can work
on fixing up the openocd driver.
