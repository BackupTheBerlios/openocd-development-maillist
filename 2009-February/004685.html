</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I haven't studied the sequence of events in detail within ft2232.c.  But 
what you are saying is making sense.  The parallel, concurrent 
processing that can be done is limited by the compare operation on the 
returning TDO data.  Since this must be done in the host, there is only 
so much &quot;outstanding/pending&quot; activity that can be posted outside 
openocd's core loop.  This includes all such places, such as USB kernel 
buffers, application byte buffers, ft2232 buffers, or even in the jtag 
chain fifo. 

Isn't it all limited by the fact that the compares must be done by the 
host, and because of that, all of these mentioned places of posting are 
inherently limited in size and in utility because they all essentially 
must be &quot;flushed&quot; in order to do the compares?   I see that the compares 
can essentially be queued, but in code like the xsvf player, this queued 
compare result is tested within the main application loop.   So if the 
main application loop is waiting, how can the queued compare be of any 
value achieving concurrency?   It cannot.

So I see no problem in shrinking the buffer down to where it will work 
for you.  However, what this is really accomplishing is a change in flow 
within the driver.  Namely there must be a read triggered out of the 
ft2232 to the host, sooner than later with the shrinkage, don't you think?

I don't think the extremely large buffers that are there now could ever 
be used unless by coincidence there was a long contiguous series of bits 
being output for which there was no need for a subsequent compare on the 
TDO.   This may occasionally happen, but....   it is a corner case, not 
worth a lot of lost sleep.


&gt;<i> BTW: With 6MHz JTAG clock, I now get about 25Kbyte/s flashing speed. Is this
</I>&gt;<i> a reasonable value?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
I get about that flashing on my arm board.

Georg, let us know your final recommendations, and if you have a patch 
that seems to be bullet proof for you.

Thanks,

Dick
