I see.

As you know, quick hacks are not our only option.   We could also 
enhance libftdi, or bag it for something better.    I haven't looked at 
it yet, but libusb does most of this work anyway.   I am not clear how 
much value libftdi is contributing yet, which sits on top of libusb.  It 
may be that some byte buffer formating functions could offer as much 
value, then libusb could be used with the buffers directly.


&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't think the extremely large buffers that are there now could ever 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be used unless by coincidence there was a long contiguous series of bits 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> being output for which there was no need for a subsequent compare on the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> TDO.   This may occasionally happen, but....   it is a corner case, not 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> worth a lot of lost sleep.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The flashing code uses bursts of 8kByte data. This seems to produce
</I>&gt;<i> MPSSE-commands of more than 128KByte. Maybe I'm just using too much working
</I>&gt;<i> area :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> BTW: With 6MHz JTAG clock, I now get about 25Kbyte/s flashing speed. Is 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a reasonable value?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I get about that flashing on my arm board.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fine...
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Georg, let us know your final recommendations, and if you have a patch 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that seems to be bullet proof for you.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess decreasing the transfer size is sufficient for now ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -#define FT2232_BUFFER_SIZE      131072
</I>&gt;<i> +#define FT2232_BUFFER_SIZE      768
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But better test if this has a potential speed impact for other usage
</I>&gt;<i> scenarios. I'm only flashing arm11, maybe I'm using only 5% of the code...
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
OK with the testing, sounds like a reasonable path to explore.  I'll 
have a chance to test this within the next 2-3 weeks.  Spinning my new 
ARM9 board  layout right now.


Thanks for the summary.

Dick
