Have a look at ft2232.c/ft2232_send_and_recv(). First, there's the
ft2232_write, then the ft2232_read. For the memory writes (burst of 8K)
needed for flashing, it looks like about 3 write bytes give 1 receive byte.
The problem is that all USB calls are synchronous so you can't just start a
concurrent read that collects the data as it appears during writing.

It looks like that the ftdi-lib has (when enabled) an asynchronous write.
But here it is quite useless, as there is no completion. So you don't get
any errors and I think that without the completion the overall read/write
synchronisation also gets lost. An async read started before the write and
with a wait for completion after it would be better. The library has
currently no provisions for that, so the only way would be a parallel
thread. Doable, but too much work for a quick hack :-)

&gt;<i> I don't think the extremely large buffers that are there now could ever

</I>
The flashing code uses bursts of 8kByte data. This seems to produce
MPSSE-commands of more than 128KByte. Maybe I'm just using too much working
area :-)

&gt;<i> &gt;BTW: With 6MHz JTAG clock, I now get about 25Kbyte/s flashing speed. Is

Fine...
 
&gt;<i> Georg, let us know your final recommendations, and if you have a patch 
</I>&gt;<i> that seems to be bullet proof for you.
</I>
I guess decreasing the transfer size is sufficient for now ;-)

-#define FT2232_BUFFER_SIZE      131072
+#define FT2232_BUFFER_SIZE      768

But better test if this has a potential speed impact for other usage
scenarios. I'm only flashing arm11, maybe I'm using only 5% of the code...
