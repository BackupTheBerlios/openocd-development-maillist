<PRE>&gt;<i> Please use svn diff to create the patch and post it as an
</I>&gt;<i> attachment.
</I>
I can do the attachment if you insist, but I won't use &quot;svn 
diff&quot;. I have several, not related patches and use quilt to keep 
them apart. That shouldn't be a problem for you, you can still 
simply do an &quot;patch -p1 &lt; XXXX.patch&quot;.

Description: Tool to work with series of patches

 Quilt manages a series of patches by keeping track of the
 changes each of them makes. They are logically organized as a
 stack, and you can apply, un-apply, refresh them easily by
 traveling into the stack (push/pop).
 .
 Quilt is good for managing additional patches applied to a
 package received as a tarball or maintained in another version
 control system. The stacked organization is proven to be
 efficient for the management of very large patch sets (more than
 hundred patches). As matter of fact, it was designed by and
 for linux kernel hackers (Andrew Morton, from the -mm  branch,
 is the original author), and its main use by the current
 upstream maintainer is to manage the (hundreds of) patches
 against the kernel made for the SUSE distribution.
 .
 <A HREF="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt">http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt</A> is the current best
 approximation of an upstream homepage.
