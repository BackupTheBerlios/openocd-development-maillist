</I>Rick,

This would be typical:

-    cur_state = end_state;
+    tap_set_state(tap_get_end_state());

I uncrustified/beautified only two files, the jtag.h file and the 
ft2232.c file as I recall.  Then I added my changes.  Because of that 
sequence of operations, and because I have no intermediate snap shots, I 
don't see that I can give you an intermediate snap shot.

Several of the files that were changed had trailing whitespace and maybe 
even a problem with newlines.  My text editor will automatically remove 
trailing whitespace.  That trailing whitespace change can lead to larger 
patch files.    You might check the repository and verify that all 
source files are svn-eol-style set to native.  Some of the newer commits 
may not be.


Here is another way to get a picture of the changes:
Sync first with the repository (optionally use a temporary working 
copy), then add the patch to your repository locally, and then grep for 
these new functions:

tap_state_transition
tap_set_state
tap_get_state
tap_set_end_state
tap_get_end_state
tap_get_tms_path
tap_move_ndx
tap_is_state_stable
tap_state_transition
tap_state_name

These are all implemented at the bottom of jtag.c, but documented near 
the top of jtag.h

The rest of it was simply search and replace stuff, which might have the 
rare mistake of course, but it is a two minute thing to fix any of those 
because of the degree of documentation in the jtag.h file.


HTH more,

Dick
