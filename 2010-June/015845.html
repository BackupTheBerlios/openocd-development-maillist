Yeah, I linked to the libusb-compat-0.1 source because I couldn't find a
web link to the 0.1 code.  I confirmed that the usb.h file and the
relevant structs are identical to the one on installed on my machine.

The OpenPilot project has quite a few developers using these JTAGs on
windows.  I think they're all using pre-built binary versions of OpenOCD
so they're not really in a position to pick up my patch.

If you could build a new binary of OpenOCD against libusb-0.1 that
included my patch and make it available to us, I'm sure I could find
testers on various versions of windows to provide you with a report.
Would that be possible?

&gt;&gt;<i> The 1.0 libraries are available on ubuntu but I didn't see any mention
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the 1.0 series being available on windows.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is in the process of integration.

Thanks for the pointer.  That should make things easier once it gets
widely adopted.

&gt;<i> libftdi-1.0 is using libusb-1.0. But I have some problems
</I>&gt;<i> to build the git tree under Cygwin due to Cmake issues.
</I>
If we get an OpenOCD 0.4 build against the old libusb-win32 (0.1) and
the old libftdi, that would give us a way of testing if this works on
windows.  Porting this functionality to work against the new libusb-1.0
library shouldn't be too difficult once we know the general idea works
on windows.

Ultimately, I think there might be value in having libusb provide formal
high-level APIs to select devices by their bus address.  Obviously, you
would want to be using that only as a last resort (after basically
everything that shows up in a descriptor) but I'm sure there are other
simple devices without a serial number.  This is the last resort method
of uniquely specifying a device when they have identical descriptors.  I
could see this being used by inexpensive HID devices.

The new get_bus_number and get_device_address functions in 1.0 may be
sufficient to accomplish this so maybe that's good enough.

&gt;&gt;<i> What version of libusb are you using?
</I>&gt;<i> I use all major versions, under Linux and Windows. I am
</I>&gt;<i> one of the admins of libusb-win32 project and one of the
</I>&gt;<i> contributing testers of libusb-1.0 under Linux/Windows.
</I>
Wow, all of them.  That's not quite the answer I was expecting :)
Thanks for taking the time to comment on my patch.

Stacey.
