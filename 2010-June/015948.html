Actually I'm thinking we should move *away* from relying on error codes.

If you check the entire code for where error codes are used(as in
if() statements), I think you'll find only a handful.

This begs the question why we have such a pervasive mechanism for
something that is almost *never* used.

32 bits can't even in theory give meaningful feedback to a user about
how he should correct a situation, we have LOG_ERROR() to do that.
I would like to move in the direction of removing all printing of error
codes in all cases but LOG_DEBUG().

I think I wrote something in the openocd documentation that openocd
errors are loosely modeled on exceptions.  In that spirit it's correct to
to propagate the retval.

I would rather that we stop if()'ing on special error codes and move to a
boolean success/failure  and use secondary return values/
communication mechanism to provide a more specialized and
fleshed out handling of special cases.

&gt;<i> For the future, and for better maintenance, I would propose to move
</I>&gt;<i> all the define for error
</I>&gt;<i> codes in a single include file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you have anything against this idea, or better suggestion?
</I>
Yes. :-) Let's stop presenting error codes to the user and relying on
error codes when deciding how to handle exceptional cases.

So if we rewrite the few cases where we if() on particular error
codes, to use a secondary return value and use LOG_ERROR()
to communicate meaningful information to the user, we can toss
out *all* the error codes afterwards. The net deletion of code
will be pretty significant! :-)

Now I don't want to create lots of noise for no observable benefit,
and there is no urgency about this so we can take our time on
this one.

That said, your patch is fine. It's just a bit of non-intrusive cleanup, merged.
