<PRE>Hi

Yesterday I had a very brief chance to work with Samsung S3C2410A chip 
and OpenOCD using a FT2232 based JTAG. There seems to be a serious 
problem with some part of the S3C24xx code as in the beginning I was 
totally unable to do any NAND Flash related stuff - doing &quot;nand probe 0&quot; 
I always returned &quot;unknown NAND flash device found, manufacturer id: 
0x00 device id: 0x00&quot; (sometimes 0xff instead of 0x00, but that was 
pretty rare). After some low-level investigation (I've tried to manually 
probe the NAND Flash using direct memory access to control registers in 
the chip) I've found out that the 8- and 16-bit wide reads always fail...
The address of the NFDATA register in S3C2410A is 0x4E00000C
&quot;mdb 0x4E00000C 1&quot; always returns 0
&quot;mdh 0x4E00000C 1&quot; always returns 0
&quot;mdw 0x4E00000C 1&quot; returns correct value
The same is true for any peripheral register of the Flash memory 
controller in this chip (unfortunately I had no time to do more tests in 
different areas). This is the reason for &quot;nand probe 0&quot; failure (it uses 
target_read_u8()). I've done a quick&amp;dirty workaround by replacing all 
uint8_t and uint16_t reads and writes with uint32_t read and writes in 
src/flash/nand/s3c2410.c and src/flash/nand/s3c24xx.c (I can send a 
patch, but that's nothing special and I don't think of it as a good 
solution...). This way NAND Flash access was possible.

Unfortunately I don't have the chip now (the contact was very brief) so 
I couldn't look for a better solution. I can try to borrow a Mini2440 
board, which will probably have a similar problem to try something else 
if anyone has an idea and there is noone to test it.

This was problem nr.1

There were two more:
2. I couldn't reset this chip to a halted state (&quot;timed-out waiting 
for...&quot;) - separate resets were connected, but I do not know the details 
of the hardware, so this can be unrelated to OpenOCD.
3. &quot;nand dump...&quot; was extremely slow (jtag khz 6000, chip running at 
unknown clock, but probably pretty high) - download speed was ~0.1kB/s, 
dumping 64kB took about 10min. at the same time (same setup, same 
hardware etc) dumping an image from standard memory was very fast (at 
least 100x faster).

This is a very brief and incomplete report, but you have to excuse me - 
the contact with S3C2410A was really short... This way you know that 
something with S3C2410A is seriously broken...

4\/3!!
