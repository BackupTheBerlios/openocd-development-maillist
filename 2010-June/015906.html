</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think the current error messages do more harm than good in the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suggestions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that the current error messages are ugly, but I don't

</I>&gt;<i> error.
</I>
The problem is that the file and line# printed is the same for all
syntax errors and failed builtins and has no relevance to the actual
error. A useful trace is only produced when a nested tcl procedure
fails on a lower level. I haven't actually noticed that feature before
but now when I've played around with it a bit I agree that we want to
keep it.

&gt;<i> However, we may be able to address this in a more fine
</I>&gt;<i> grained fashion than simply turning the stack traces on
</I>&gt;<i> and off.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps you could post some examples and show what
</I>&gt;<i> parts of the stack trace that is useful and what's just (debug)
</I>&gt;<i> noise?
</I>
For example, misspelling a subcommand:

&gt;<i> flash prob 0
</I>flash prob 0: command requires more arguments &lt;-- 1)
in procedure 'flash' called at file &quot;command.c&quot;, line 654 &lt;-- 2)
called at file &quot;command.c&quot;, line 365 &lt;-- 3)

1) This is nonsense, but not really related to the stack trace.
2) I didn't call the flash command from command.c, i called it from an
interactive telnet session. Nothing flash related can be found at line
654.
3) Same as 2, but worse. What was called at line 365??

In short, there's no useful part of this stack trace.

A more interesting example, a nested command that fails:

$ openocd -f bitsbytes.tcl -c &quot;normalize_bitfield 1 2 q&quot;
...
Runtime error, file &quot;bitsbytes.tcl&quot;, line 31: &lt;-- 4)
    Syntax error in expression
in procedure 'normalize_bitfield' called at file &quot;command.c&quot;, line 654 &lt;-- 5)
in procedure 'extract_bitfield' called at file &quot;bitsbytes.tcl&quot;, line 50 &lt;-- 6)
in procedure 'create_mask' called at file &quot;bitsbytes.tcl&quot;, line 39

This is where I start to see the point of the stack trace. However,
it's not correct.

4) there's no normalize_bitfield at line 31 as it's suggested.
5) same problem as 2, I called it from the command line.
6) extract_bitfield is really called at line 50, but NOT in procedure
create_mask. Line 50 is in normalize_bitfield.

It struck me that the stack trace would make much more sense if it was
written in the reverse order! Let's see:

Runtime error, file &quot;bitsbytes.tcl&quot;, line 31:
    Syntax error in expression
in procedure 'create_mask' called at file &quot;bitsbytes.tcl&quot;, line 39
in procedure 'extract_bitfield' called at file &quot;bitsbytes.tcl&quot;, line 50
in procedure 'normalize_bitfield' called at file &quot;command.c&quot;, line 654

Apart from the command.c reference this looks quite alright!

I attach two patches. One to remove the command.c references and one
to rearrange the stack trace output. Any takers?
