<PRE>Hi all, Hi Xiaofan ,
&#160;
I've had problems with my netbook and finally I reinstalled XP .
I've downloaded once more openocd 0.4.0 for windows&#160;and extracted it .

You are talking in of of your answers of&#160; Inf directory in openocd directory, which I don't find,
&#160;are you&#160;talking about the drivers directory ? Anway searching&#160; for inf pattern in the openocd 
&#160;directory resulted in no file found .
&#160;
I guess you were talking about the inf directory of libusb-win32-device-bin.1.1.14.3 which contains the inf wizard .
&#160;
I've downloaded libusb-win32-device-bin-1.1.14.3 on sourceforge and extracted it besides openocd directory&#160; in My documents\Download directory .
&#160;
I got into the directory containing the inf wizard and executed it .
An inf file has been created ,&#160; in that directory , and meanwhile, as I had to plug in the jtagkey-tiny to create the inf file, a driver installation assistant popped up .
&#160;I chose &quot;Don't search for a driver, I will chose it manually&quot; ( translation from french )
&#160;and I had then to choose in a list of type of devices , I chose Usb controller and the answer
&#160;was that non suitable driver was found .
&#160;I have then been asked to set a directory where the &quot;Disk &quot; is .
&#160;I guess this is useful if the drivers were stored in a disk .
&#160;Anyway, I entered the directory which contains the inf file .
&#160;The answer of the system is that the specified directory doesn't contain any information concerning your device .
Is there a way to check that the device is functional ?
It is new actually .
Thanks for your help,
&#160;C&#233;dric

Hi,
?I am a windows newbie, so thank you very much for your patience 
?and kindness Xiaofan .
?Unfortunately, I don't understand things in the second :-) .

?I deinstalled the amontec drivers from the device manager menu and even the devices . I've also deleted the ftd2XX.sys file from the
?WINDOWS tree .
?I plugged the programmer off, and a little later plugged it on .

?I selected the manual selection , but at the bottom of the first window
?that appears after having chosen to do a manual installation , appears a yellow exclamation mark signal stating : &quot; This driver has not been digitally signed &quot; even before that I tell the path to the driver
?I'd like to install . Seems windows is hooked up to the amontec jtag driver that I installed first and that even before deinstallation of it, it is still there somewhere on the computer .
?In this dialog if I click on Next, the installer tries to install the amontec 
?drivers without asking for it , but I guess it as it asks for the ftd2XX file that I deleted, and otherwise if I click on Provided Disk , I can tell the directory that contains the .inf file previously created , but finally the installer answers that the directory specified doesn't contain any information relevant for the device .
?What should I do ?
?Thanks in advance for your precious help,
?C?dric
?

But you just do not believe me...

You can not use the Amontec drivers (ftd2xx) with the binary which is
using libftdi. You need to install the libusb-win32 driver. Freddie
provided the inf file to do that. It is inside the Zip file.
libusb-win32_ft2232_driver-100223

********** info.txt *****************

WHY LIBUSB-WIN32 DRIVERS?
_________________________

Since June/July of 2009 due to alleged GPL license violation OpenOCD cannot be
distributed with support for ftd2xx.dll library. That's why FT2232 JTAGs have to
be used via libusb-win32 drivers, and OpenOCD will be linked with libftdi
library. Because of that OpenOCD users have to use different JTAG drivers. This
small document provides a basic &quot;how to&quot; of libusb-win32 drivers for FT2232
based JTAGs. Users who need OpenOCD linked with ftd2xx.dll can build the
software from sources.

DEVICES SUPPORTED BY THIS DRIVER PACKAGE
________________________________________

The .inf file provided with the driver in that package has entries for most of
existing FT2232 JTAGs. These devices are:
??? - Amontec JTAGkey
? ? ? ? ...

DRIVER INSTALLATION
___________________

If there were FTDI drivers installed in the system, they have to be manually
removed (via system's Device Manager) and then libusb-win32 drivers have to be
installed manually. In case of &quot;JTAG + UART/RS-232&quot; devices only the driver for
the JTAG channel needs to be removed. In case of &quot;JTAG-only&quot; devices the driver
for the second (unused) channel also can (but doesn't have to) be replaced.

Uninstallation of ftd2xx.dll driver:

When the device is plugged, open the Device Manager (Control Panel &gt; System &gt;
Hardware &gt; Device Manager), right click on the JTAG device (in &quot;Universal Serial
Bus controllers&quot; group) and Uninstall it. Now unplug the JTAG and wait a few
moments.

Installation of libusb-win32 driver:

Plug the device to the USB port of your PC. The system should discover a new
device and the installation wizard should be started. Don't use automatic
methods (as this will probably install the drivers you just removed) - use
&quot;Don't search. I will choose the driver to install&quot; (fully manual mode) instead.
Succesfully installed driver(s) will be displayed in the &quot;LibUSB-Win32 Devices&quot;
group in the Device Manager.

Ok, maybe this is easier for you.

Reinstall the Amontec driver. Then locate the device in Device
Manager,&#160; choose to &quot;update the driver&quot;, manually point it to the
INF directory of OpneOCD. You should be ok then.

The device may be listed in two places since it is a USB
composite device (Channel A and Channel B), so you
may need to do this twice.

If Channel B is using VCP driver, then you should only
do the &quot;update driver&quot; thingy for Channel A.
