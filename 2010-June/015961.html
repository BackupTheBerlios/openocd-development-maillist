<PRE>Hi,
&#160;I am a windows newbie, so thank you very much for your patience 
&#160;and kindness Xiaofan .
&#160;Unfortunately, I don't understand things in the second :-) .

&#160;I deinstalled the amontec drivers from the device manager menu and even the devices . I've also deleted the ftd2XX.sys file from the
&#160;WINDOWS tree .
&#160;I plugged the programmer off, and a little later plugged it on .

&#160;I selected the manual selection , but at the bottom of the first window
&#160;that appears after having chosen to do a manual installation , appears a yellow exclamation mark signal stating : &quot; This driver has not been digitally signed &quot; even before that I tell the path to the driver
&#160;I'd like to install . Seems windows is hooked up to the amontec jtag driver that I installed first and that even before deinstallation of it, it is still there somewhere on the computer .
&#160;In this dialog if I click on Next, the installer tries to install the amontec 
&#160;drivers without asking for it , but I guess it as it asks for the ftd2XX file that I deleted, and otherwise if I click on Provided Disk , I can tell the directory that contains the .inf file previously created , but finally the installer answers that the directory specified doesn't contain any information relevant for the device .
&#160;What should I do ?
&#160;Thanks in advance for your precious help,
&#160;C&#233;dric
&#160;

As I mentioned before,

But you just do not believe me...

You can not use the Amontec drivers (ftd2xx) with the binary which is
using libftdi. You need to install the libusb-win32 driver. Freddie
provided the inf file to do that. It is inside the Zip file.
libusb-win32_ft2232_driver-100223

********** info.txt *****************

WHY LIBUSB-WIN32 DRIVERS?
_________________________

Since June/July of 2009 due to alleged GPL license violation OpenOCD cannot be
distributed with support for ftd2xx.dll library. That's why FT2232 JTAGs have to
be used via libusb-win32 drivers, and OpenOCD will be linked with libftdi
library. Because of that OpenOCD users have to use different JTAG drivers. This
small document provides a basic &quot;how to&quot; of libusb-win32 drivers for FT2232
based JTAGs. Users who need OpenOCD linked with ftd2xx.dll can build the
software from sources.

DEVICES SUPPORTED BY THIS DRIVER PACKAGE
________________________________________

The .inf file provided with the driver in that package has entries for most of
existing FT2232 JTAGs. These devices are:
&#160;&#160;&#160; - Amontec JTAGkey
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ...

DRIVER INSTALLATION
___________________

If there were FTDI drivers installed in the system, they have to be manually
removed (via system's Device Manager) and then libusb-win32 drivers have to be
installed manually. In case of &quot;JTAG + UART/RS-232&quot; devices only the driver for
the JTAG channel needs to be removed. In case of &quot;JTAG-only&quot; devices the driver
for the second (unused) channel also can (but doesn't have to) be replaced.

Uninstallation of ftd2xx.dll driver:

When the device is plugged, open the Device Manager (Control Panel &gt; System &gt;
Hardware &gt; Device Manager), right click on the JTAG device (in &quot;Universal Serial
Bus controllers&quot; group) and Uninstall it. Now unplug the JTAG and wait a few
moments.

Installation of libusb-win32 driver:

Plug the device to the USB port of your PC. The system should discover a new
device and the installation wizard should be started. Don't use automatic
methods (as this will probably install the drivers you just removed) - use
&quot;Don't search. I will choose the driver to install&quot; (fully manual mode) instead.
Succesfully installed driver(s) will be displayed in the &quot;LibUSB-Win32 Devices&quot;
group in the Device Manager.
