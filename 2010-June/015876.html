Yeah, lsusb is quite accommodating in how you specify the device.  I
considered allowing those features in my patch as well but dropped them
to better support this on all platforms (see below).

&gt;<i> IMO this is highly desirable also in openocd, but it may not be

</I>&gt;<i> specifying a bus address is actually consistent across all platforms

</I>&gt;<i> another type of bus address. I have to check this.
</I>
I agree, the specification of bus address is very likely to be different
across platforms.  I wasn't able to check other platforms for myself so
I tried to code this as generically as possible.

The reason that I'm doing only a simple strncmp() on the user-specified
config string and the &quot;:&quot; concatenated literal values contained in the
-&gt;dirname and -&gt;filename members is so that the code could automatically
support different notation on different platforms.  It makes no
assumptions about the contents (ie. safe to drop leading zeros) of the
dirname and filename members.

This way, if windows puts -&gt;dirname=&quot;the dirname&quot; and -&gt;filename=&quot;the
filename&quot; then the windows config file would need to be:
  ft2232_bus_addr &quot;the dirname:the filename&quot;

I don't have any idea how to find out the contents of these fields on
windows other than having openocd dump it out.  The patch provides this
if you turn on -d.  Look for &quot;Considering ftdi device at bus addr&quot; in
the output.

If you'd like, I can resubmit the patch after adding the clarification
about requiring all leading zeros in the bus:devnum for now.  Was the
leading zeros requirement the only discrepancy between docs/code or were
there others?

Once the contents of dirname and filename are known on other platforms,
it may be possible to make the config spec more user friendly.  That
could be enhanced in a future commit.

Thanks for the comments.

Stacey.
