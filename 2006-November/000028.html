</I>Follow up to myself:
That explanation was bogus, sorry. No matter how small the working_area is, a 
local write_algorithm would be fine, too, if all the writing is done within 
that function.
I introduced the working_area concept with the LPC2000 driver, where the IAP 
calling code is used for every flash operation, not just writes. The host 
function that invokes the IAP function is called from several places, and 
keeping the IAP code on the target throughout several flash operations saves 
a lot of writes to target memory.

The situtation for other flashes might change if there's a user of the flash_t 
interface which doesn't write all of the flash in one go.
Michael Fischer's OpenOCD-Embedded for example might not have enough RAM to 
flash a 16MB (or even 256kB) image in one go, so the buffer size used in 
handle_flash_write_command might have to be decreased, and several calls to 
flash_t-&gt;write are necessary. In that case, preserving the algorithm would 
offer a performance gain. The same could be true for GDB's flash write 
feature, once we implement it.

To sum up, I don't think it is necessary to keep write_algorithm (or any other 
algorithm) in memory, but doing so might offer a performance improvement at 
little or no cost.

Regards,

Dominic
