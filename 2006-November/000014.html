<PRE>Hi,

I've just committed some changes to /trunk, including the issues brought up by 
Michael (command_run_file) and Magnus (ft2232 FT_Read retries, hope I got 
this right).

There was also a rather serious bug in soft_reset_halt which is supposed to 
get the target in debug state and initialize the core to the state it would 
have after a reset. The code failed when the target was in Thumb state, 
didn't clear the debug request (or breakpoint used to enter debug), and 
didn't set INTDIS bit. Thanks to Bernard (welcome to list, btw.) for helping 
me track this down.

Working_areas allocated by flash algorithms only got freed on a &quot;resume&quot;, but 
not when the target was reset. Currently, I've moved that to 
arm7_9_assert_reset, but target_process_reset might be a more appropriate 
place. For now, every target has to call target_free_all_working_areas for 
all operations that might change the target from halted to running (except 
for debug resume).

Michael, it would be great if you could release a new version of your Windows 
installer, maybe after waiting a day or two to make sure there's no 
regression.

The other svn commits were XScale only, and shouldn't cause problems for the 
ARM7/9 stuff.

I've replied to a thread in the Luminary Micro forum, telling them about 
Magnus' work on Cortex-M support (Martin Thomas mentioned it already, I 
wanted to confirm). They seem to like these efforts, and offered to help, so 
Magnus, if you need anything, feel free to contact &quot;LMI Eric&quot; in their forum.

Best regards,

Dominic
