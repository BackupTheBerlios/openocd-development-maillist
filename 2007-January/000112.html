Hi,  

&gt;<i> definitely need both nSRST and nTRST, otherwise you can't 
</I>&gt;<i> debug a XScale target.
</I>
I added the SRST line, and all lines can be controlled now from OOCD. I
also read the manuals for PXA270. Catch the CPU from RESET seems to be
one of two ways. There is some other way noted in the manual. But as far
as I understood from the sources, OOCD uses the &quot;catch in RESET&quot;
approach.

&gt;<i> You'll also have to change the .cfg to tell the OpenOCD that 
</I>&gt;<i> both resets are available: reset_config trst_and_srst
</I>
Done. Attached the current config as well as the current debug output
from OOCD. 

&gt;<i> As Pierre (another PXA27x user) already mentioned, the 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD should be run from ./src/, as the path to the debug 
</I>&gt;<i> handler binary is currently still hardcoded.
</I>
Yepp, found this myself :-)

&gt;<i> The next problem you'll come across is this warning:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Warning: jtag.c:1074 jtag_read_buffer(): value captured 
</I>&gt;<i> during scan didn't pass the requested check: captured: 0x00 
</I>&gt;<i> check_value: 0x02 check_mask: 0x07
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After releasing nTRST (but while nSRST is asserted), the 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD tries to program the DCSR register to tell the target 
</I>&gt;<i> to keep reset internally asserted. When accessing the DCSR 
</I>&gt;<i> register, a fixed value of b010 is expected in bits [2:0], 
</I>&gt;<i> but the check for that fails. The DCSR register is likely not 
</I>&gt;<i> programmed after this, and once nSRST is released, the target 
</I>&gt;<i> starts executing from 0x0, instead of waiting for the 
</I>&gt;<i> debugger to download the debug handler.
</I>
Right, that's what I found in the manuals. And - most amazingly - this
morning, just after switching on the target, it simply worked _once_. I
got the correct response, and OOCD started to upload the debug handler
code into the miniIC. After that it stopped working - no changes to the
source. And this happened before I added the SRST line to the cable.
Unfortunately I can't remember, if I had the jumper set on SRST or
whatever else.

&gt;<i> Pierre already tried to increase the delays after releasing 
</I>&gt;<i> the resets, but that didn't solve the problem so far.
</I>
That is what I tried today as well.

&gt;<i> At the moment, I don't have an explanation for this behaviour.
</I>
Fine, but at least I'm not alone. And most important it work _once_ for
me. And as the target was cold, I might be related to small timing
differences between TRST and SRST assertion. The manual notes, that TRST
shall be asserted before or at least the same time as SRST. Maybe it
might help to assert TRST first, wait some small amount of time, and
then assert SRST. This will be the next thing I will try - proposals and
guidelines on such a change are welcomed.

I attached my current changes to the xscale branch. Most changes just
extend the DEBUG() outputs. And I added the a new cable type for my
hacked JTAG cable setup, which is the supplied KaRo JTAG Adaptor + a
bridge between D3 of the parrallel port and ping 15 (SRST) of the ICE
connector.

Regards
Carsten
