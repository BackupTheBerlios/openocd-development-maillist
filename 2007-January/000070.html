<PRE>Hi

I have comitted the very small change that I think should be included
right now.

There is a more interesting patch that almost doubles the flash writing
speed. This uses the possibility to write to cortex-m3 memory while the
target is running.

There are two linked buffers on the target and buffer headers that
contains addressing info for this block target. The algorithm execution
code is split into two parts: start_algorithm that sets up registers and
starts the debug code execution on the target and finalize_algorithm
that waits for a halt and stops the target on a timeout. The algorithm
is called with only the address of buffer1 in R0. The host downloads new
data to the target while the target is in the flash programming loop.
The addressing info is updated and flagged as ready and the target can
start writing next buffer. The target code sets a memory address valuye
to zero to signal that this block has been written and new data can be
downloaded. The last buffer has a zero next buffer pointer. The host
calls finalize algorithm to wait for algorithm completion.

This is quite stable but there are timing issues when accessing the
memory bus from JTAG with the target running that needs more work. It is
ok if the jtag speed is set low but I would like to investigate more,
and time is scarce. Anyhow this extra speed is not really needed for the
current chips with max 64kB flash.

Regards,
Magnus
