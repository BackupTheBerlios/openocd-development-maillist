<PRE>Hello Michael,

the errors in the console window indicate that GDB/Insight requested memory 
from address -1, which caused the OpenOCD to report an error because the data 
access was aborted.

I'm not sure about the size of the memory request (presumably 4 byte), but 
that doesn't matter in the case of an unaligned address. The OpenOCD 
translates this to a read_memory call with size=1 and count=number of 
requested bytes. The address space from 0xfffff000 to 0xffffffff belongs to 
the vectored interrupt controller. While this isn't documented (or I couldn't 
find it), accesses to that area seem to be restricted to word-size (32-bit). 
Accesses to any of these addresses with half-word or byte size lead to an 
abort.

So the problem is that GDB/Insight requests memory from an unaligned address 
that doesn't support unaligned accesses on the LPCs. You didn't see a problem 
with the SAM7 becaused byte-wide accesses at address 0xffffffff don't cause 
aborts on the SAM7s.

I just saw that Spen mentioned that this is actually a bug in Insight that is 
already fixed in current SVN. With Insight/293 Spen meant bug entry #293, you 
can view the report at <A HREF="http://sourceware.org/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl.">http://sourceware.org/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl.</A>

Dominic
