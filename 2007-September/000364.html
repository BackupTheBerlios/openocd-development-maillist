</I>Okay, I got it working - see the attached patch. The patch is against 
the current
xscale-ixp-be svn (R207) and addresses these problems:
 - add two helper functions to make code more readable
 - fix bug in cfi_write on intel flash (in non-workspace mode, the 
counter could underrun below zero, and flashing would never stop). Also, 
there was a off-by-one error on the last block/word (&quot;fixup 2 unaligned 
tail bytes&quot; on a 16-bit flash)
 - fix spansion non-workspace operation
 - fix spansion workspace operation

I tested both Intel and Spansion flash roms with and without write 
buffer on a big-endian IXP420.

The main problem with the spansion flash code was that the commands were 
written in the wrong endianness, and the case buffersize==0 was not 
handled right in cfi_write.

A general comment:
The datasheets I have state that D8..D15 are don't care during command 
cycles, so it is not necessary to mask the command codes - we can simply 
use the constant 0xA0A0A0A0 to initiate a Spansion write operation, 
instead of masking that to 0x00A0 in case of a 16-bit bus. The only 
thing that needs masking is the compare mask for the status register.

Also, the unlock addresses currently distinguish between 0x555/0x2AA and 
0x5555/0x2AAA. The upper addresses should also be don't care during 
command cycles, so we could simply use the longer address in all cases, 
unless there really are flash roms that really want to see 0x555/0x2AA 
with the upper bits 0 (I have not yet encountered such devices).

Comments?
