Yes, I had the same problem with my BSc two years ago and LPC2148 cpu.
Right now at MSc I have the same problem with Cortex/STM32Primer2 and
SWD - not implemented at all (but it will be soon). Noone asks me why
did I choose this chip, this device, this kind of activity, noone even
cares. Still working on it to make it happen by all means :-)
Unfortunately, more and more often, people think that things get done
just by one-click, forgetting what happens behind that click...
Nowadays even commercial utilities are buggy and poorly designed, this
is why Open Source is a real alternative to them. This also shows how
much work is required to get things done - things are getting more and
more complex, people think exactly the opposite - only sales care
about one click applications making customers even more dependent on
this kind of stuff :-)


&gt;<i> Furthermore I don't know enough about JTAG to have any clue what is going wrong.
</I>
Probably you need to get familiar with it, or simply use commercial
tools of the chip manufacturer (TI is not good at sharing their
specifications but there is a dedicated wiki for omap devices)...


&gt;<i> My intention was not to whine (ok a bit - sometimes it helps *g*). I just
</I>&gt;<i> need the information if there are known bugs/problems for my target - so I
</I>&gt;<i> can reason why I wasn't able to use the debugger.
</I>
There are lots of problems, Oyvind pointed the direction, you are free
to verify your skills, or motivate someone that will :-)


Best regards and good luck! :-)
Tomek

ps/2: I just found that switching off clock divisor in 2232H breaks
khz clocking - fix in progress...
