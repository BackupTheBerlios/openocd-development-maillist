</I>Usually GDB starts the executable itself on the development pc and halts
at main on it's own, and does not
use a JTAG interface to connect to an embedded target.

In the embedded world it's quite common to attach to a running target
and not halt the CPU or load the executable and stop at main,
as it might be running from flash memory.  When attaching to such a
target it is not always possible (or nor wanted) to stop
the target right away, as you may not want to interfere normal operation
and just break into the target when
a special HW breakpoint ot exception is hit. So I don't like the idea of
automatically halting the target to satisfy
GDB's needs / expectations.

&gt;<i> What are the other advantages? 
</I>The main advantage of omitting a default halt is the flexibility gain,
as you are completely free on how to use openOCD
to attach to your target. There is a way via scripting to get your
so-called default GDB expectations, so both worlds are working
with the current openOCD implementation.
&gt;<i> If they are important, we can consider
</I>&gt;<i> changing GDB not to expect target halted when it connects to OpenOCD.
</I>I don't think that this change will make the GDB developers happy.
Probably throwing an error from openOCD, when a register read request is
received while the target is running
might be a better idea, but I don't know if the GDB protocol allows this.

Michael
