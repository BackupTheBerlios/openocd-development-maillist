would need to set it via telnet interface after having fiddled out the
address through the .map / .lst files.

</I>No you can always set a HW breakpoint while the CPU is running without
halting the target, or enable vector catches  at least on the ARM CPU's
I am usually working with. Never had problems setting these at runtime.

&gt;&gt;<i> In your case I think it would be the best to write a &quot;gdb-attach&quot; event

</I>I think this is the right way, but as scripts come from different
persons, who all have different needs, they may really be different at
that point.

Calling &quot;reset init&quot; in gdb-attach has a similar result as &quot;halt&quot; as the
CPU is halted and in a defined state (usually). The only difference is
the additional reset to the hardware, which might help in case the CPU
has stalled at some point while debugging (I had that on our ARM bases
controller when I tried to access memory areas that are internally not
connected and result in a AHBL timeout). So as you can see this might be
hardware / controller dependent and also vary from the debugging goal
you have. I think most of the scripts show how to work with openOCD but
you will need to override some functions to make them fit your needs.

I am usually using the scripts and define some custom reset init / gdb
attach events depending if I want to load an application or just attach
to a running CPU.

Michael
