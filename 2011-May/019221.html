</I>&gt;<i> I am sorry but I can't understand your meaning. Are you mean only
</I>&gt;<i> the version of u-boot &gt; 1.3.2 support dcc?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do you use a mini2440?
</I>&gt;<i> Oh no. I use Uptech2410 board based on samsung s3c2410. I think you
</I>&gt;<i> can hardly find information about this board. Uptech is a Chinese
</I>&gt;<i> company and the service it provided is very very bad. The only thing
</I>&gt;<i> it provided me useful is the modification patch for u-boot 1.3.2.
</I>&gt;<i> According to that patch, I believe this board is very similar to
</I>&gt;<i> smdk2410, the difference is uptech2410 has no NOR flash and it also
</I>&gt;<i> has a cheaper NIC.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's looks like a pll init issue
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are you about them?
</I>&gt;<i> I wrote the initialization code of PLL and SDRAM in the procedure
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;reset-init&quot;, so if I cannot execute &quot;reset init&quot;, my initialization
</I>&gt;<i> code woun't be executed. You can see that code from my previous
</I>&gt;<i> emails. I extracted that code from the example project provided by
</I>&gt;<i> the CD disk of that board. Those example projects are written by
</I>&gt;<i> ADS.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think I have to say something more. If I wrote
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;
</I>&gt;<i> init
</I>&gt;<i> halt
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> in openocd.cfg, the board can be halted as I said before. But when I
</I>&gt;<i> download u-boot image into my board with wiggler, the &quot;current line&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> feature is unavailable(I also said this in the previous post). But I
</I>&gt;<i> missed one thing in that email: the &quot;disassemble window&quot; told me all
</I>&gt;<i> instructions are UNKNOWN(0xffffffff). I think although wiggler can
</I>&gt;<i> download image to board, the image is still incorrect.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;BTW: I have done a lot of test these days.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;1. wiggler: I can &quot;reset&quot; my board with &quot;reset&quot; command. But if I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;run &quot;reset init&quot; or &quot;reset halt&quot;, my board would only reset but not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;halted. And OpenOCD would told me &quot;timed out&quot; waiting the board
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;halt. But, what the strange thing is, if I just run &quot;halt&quot; command
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;and NOT run any command related to &quot;reset&quot; BEFORE it, my board CAN
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;enter halt status.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;2. jlink: I can run &quot;reset&quot;, &quot;reset halt&quot;, &quot;reset init&quot; command
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;successfully, but I cannot download anything into my board, the DCC
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;error occurred. If I run &quot;arm7_9 dcc_download disable&quot;(maybe the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;spelling is incorrect, I am not in Linux now) and then tried to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;debug my u-boot in eclipse, the download progress can finished
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;without any error, but in fact, the program cannot be executed. It
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;always stopped with a SIGNAL. Even I run resume in OpenOCD, it also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;cannot be executed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;3. I don't know why this happened, but some days before, &quot;reset&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;command cannot be done if I use wiggler cable to debug my board.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;There are always some errors when I execute &quot;reset&quot;, &quot;reset halt&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&quot;reset init&quot; and my board cannot be reset. But at that time, I can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;run &quot;halt&quot; command and debug my u-boot in eclipse, the only problem
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;is the &quot;current line&quot; function cannot work property, I mean, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;line which highlighted in eclipse is not the line currently run.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Maybe you can find this in one of my before email. Maybe this is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;caused the upgrade of my Debian system?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;It's looks like a pll init issue
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;are you about them?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;I apologized for my bad English but I still hope you can understand
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;what I talked about. :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Don't worry I here much worse english everyday
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Best Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;J.
