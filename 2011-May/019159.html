<PRE>I have been trying to add eCos/Cortex-M3 RTOS support to OpenOCD, and
have some code that seems to go some way toward doing the right thing.
 The first patch adds that support - it contains a new file (based
heavily on the existing ThreadX/FreeRTOS model) to parse the thread
list.  It's not the most efficient - it iterates over a linked list
twice - once to count the entries and once to parse out the
information.  I couldn't see an explicit thread count variable to
parse, and I wanted to keep the code as similar to previous to
minimise my chances of making mistakes.  I have also added a different
register-stacking structure in another file.

With that first patch in place, I found GDB would display the thread
list with &quot;info threads&quot; but would then become unstable (as described
in a previous email).  I found that when GDB requested the current
thread (&quot;qC&quot;) OpenOCD always replied with a generic response (&quot;QC0&quot;).
I altered this to try to report the actual current thread, as in the
second patch.  The first time GDB runs up, the instability still
occurs, since the request is sent before OpenOCD has parsed the thread
data.  Stopping GDB and restarting it then seems to work OK, since a
current thread value is retained in OpenOCD's rtos data structure from
the last session.  This seems like the wrong behaviour, but is
coincidentally sufficient to prevent GDB from complaining.  I'd be
interested to hear if anyone has seen similar behaviour with other
RTOSs.

Testing for these patches has been performed using top-of-trunk eCos
running in a ROM startup configuration from a board like an
STM3210E-EVAL (but only using internal RAM).  I've been using the
thread&lt;x&gt; test programs that are part of the kernel test suite as test
applications.

I'm not sure how to take this further - I'm not sufficiently familiar
with GDB to diagnose the problem I'm seeing with the current-thread
reporting, but I want to put eCos support in front of others to get
some feedback.
