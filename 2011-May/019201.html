<PRE>Evan

&gt;<i> Could you provide a list of what order you give GDB/OpenOCD commands and
</I>&gt;<i> which GDB-Remote commands/responses you see?
</I>
I have attached two files.  gdb_trace.txt shows two runs through the
same sequence of events:
- attach to the remote target
- reset the target
- set breakpoint
- run to breakpoint
- &quot;info threads&quot;
- single step

The first time through, the thread information looks correct, as far
as I can tell.  However, single stepping causes the error message.  I
immediately reconnect to OpenOCD and perform the exact same steps, and
I don't get an error message.  The output from OpenOCD is also
attached.  Notice on the first connection (line 35) we return QC0 for
current thread, and on the second connection (line 168) we return
QC00000005.  The data in the last response is incorrect, since the
RTOS code hasn't even queried the target at that point.  Still, it
seems to make a difference of some kind...

GDB is version 7.2, modified as you described in your bug report -
this has made no noticeable difference in this case.  OpenOCD is
top-of-trunk, except that I have edited the functions you suggested to
print the GDB messages going in and out.

I hope you can see something I've missed

Alan
