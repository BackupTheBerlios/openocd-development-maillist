&gt;<i> Hello everyone,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am in the process of adding debugging support to one of my employer's DSP.
</I>&gt;<i> I came across OpenOCD and figured it would be a nice way of interfacing the
</I>&gt;<i> hardware with GDB, given the existing support of many JTAG adapters.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The focus of my company is multi-core designs, which means the debugging
</I>&gt;<i> solution I come up with will need to be relatively scalable.
</I>&gt;<i> To do so, I envisioned an ICEpick like architecture (over IEEE 1149.1) that
</I>&gt;<i> would support adding and removing TAP controller at runtime. Thus shortening
</I>&gt;<i> the lengths of the chain and increasing the performance when debugging
</I>&gt;<i> dozens of cores.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My concern is not so much regarding the hardware implementation (although I
</I>&gt;<i> am definitely still open to suggestions), but with OpenOCD's support of
</I>&gt;<i> multicore systems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1- Currently, multiple CPUs are connected to the GDB clients via multiple
</I>&gt;<i> GDB servers and not via GDB threads. Is the addition of a threaded GDB
</I>&gt;<i> server planned in any roadmap ?
</I>
There is already some smp support in there, you may want to have a look
at that. Using threads has been discussed, but I think the model would
break down with MMUs. That said for DSP's it could be a good model
if they don't have MMUs.

The OpenOCD maintainers would gladly accept well worked out patches
in this area!

&gt;<i> 2- I read in the documentation that &quot;In OpenOCD, tap enabling/disabling is
</I>&gt;<i> invoked by the Tcl commands shown below, and is implemented using TAP event
</I>&gt;<i> handlers.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> I first thought I would be able to :
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;- Connect N gdb clients to OpenOCD.
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;- Wait for a request from a gdb client.
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;- Then add the relevant TAP to the JTAG chain, perform the requested
</I>&gt;<i> operation and remove the TAP from the chain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I assume this needs to be implemented within the target C files of OpenOCD.
</I>&gt;<i> However, I am under the impression that the target layer is only aware of
</I>&gt;<i> the existence of its own TAP controller. Which means no direct access to the
</I>&gt;<i> Master TAP, and therefore no ability to add/remove TAPs. Is that correct ?
</I>
Look at Cortex A implementation. It currently operates with a concept
of a &quot;master tap&quot; common to all cores.

&gt;<i> If so, could you suggest a way of supporting this behavior with OpenOCD ?
</I>
This is a sizable amount of work and would require somebody to do it
as part of their day-time job I think.
