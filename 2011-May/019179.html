<PRE>Hi Alan,



I might be able to help:

Could you provide a list of what order you give GDB/OpenOCD commands and which GDB-Remote commands/responses you see?

If you haven't already, I suggest putting packet prints into gdb_put_packet() and gdb_input_inner().



Attached is a trace from my system with FreeRTOS.



The way I did it in the RTOS's was that if the current thread was set to 0 or 1 then it returned the current running context (i.e. the true register values). This seems to avoid the problem you're having.





Some notes regarding RTOS awareness:

*         You may need to fix the GDB bug described in <A HREF="http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12648">http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12648</A>

*         Generally you will want to make your OpenOCD script blank the device memory so that the RTOS awareness does not read old, invalid thread information



Regards,



Evan Hunter

Subject: [Openocd-development] Provisional eCos RTOS support

Message-ID: &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">BANLkTinHpe7tFZAx78cUk1W_2z0_3ykUFg at mail.gmail.com</A>&lt;mailto:<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">BANLkTinHpe7tFZAx78cUk1W_2z0_3ykUFg at mail.gmail.com</A>&gt;&gt;

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;



I have been trying to add eCos/Cortex-M3 RTOS support to OpenOCD, and

have some code that seems to go some way toward doing the right thing.

The first patch adds that support - it contains a new file (based

heavily on the existing ThreadX/FreeRTOS model) to parse the thread

list.  It's not the most efficient - it iterates over a linked list

twice - once to count the entries and once to parse out the

information.  I couldn't see an explicit thread count variable to

parse, and I wanted to keep the code as similar to previous to

minimise my chances of making mistakes.  I have also added a different

register-stacking structure in another file.



With that first patch in place, I found GDB would display the thread

list with &quot;info threads&quot; but would then become unstable (as described

in a previous email).  I found that when GDB requested the current

thread (&quot;qC&quot;) OpenOCD always replied with a generic response (&quot;QC0&quot;).

I altered this to try to report the actual current thread, as in the

second patch.  The first time GDB runs up, the instability still

occurs, since the request is sent before OpenOCD has parsed the thread

data.  Stopping GDB and restarting it then seems to work OK, since a

current thread value is retained in OpenOCD's rtos data structure from

the last session.  This seems like the wrong behaviour, but is

coincidentally sufficient to prevent GDB from complaining.  I'd be

interested to hear if anyone has seen similar behaviour with other

RTOSs.



Testing for these patches has been performed using top-of-trunk eCos

running in a ROM startup configuration from a board like an

STM3210E-EVAL (but only using internal RAM).  I've been using the

thread&lt;x&gt; test programs that are part of the kernel test suite as test

applications.



I'm not sure how to take this further - I'm not sufficiently familiar

with GDB to diagnose the problem I'm seeing with the current-thread

reporting, but I want to put eCos support in front of others to get

some feedback.
