Ah, I forgot to mention the most important - to be able to realize
transport I have extended &quot;struct jtag_interface&quot; with &quot;transfer_bits&quot;
and &quot;signal_operate&quot; methods that transfer bitstream out/in of the
char array and can switch/read specified signal (exactly what you
need). &quot;queue_execute&quot; was not enough to make transport work without
rewriting/touching existing code, as all of the functions were already
implemented for jtag, so these functions were necessary to be added,
maintains backward compatibility and does not breaks existing code,
allowing to create bitstreams and signaling for transports other than
jtag. Old drivers will simply have null pointer to these functions, so
it will be easy to recognize if function is implemented.

signal_operate() can read and write i/o states based on signal name
string (char array). struct jtag_interface was also extended with
*signals field, where signals is the singly linked list of structures,
where each element holds the name string, bitmask, value and pointer
to next element. Interface driver can register signals during
interface initialization, so signals can be easily used for
signal_operate(). It is possible ofcourse to implement tcl command to
work with this function directly with the driver code :-) Signals are
dynamic list because each signal in fact is a port mask that can
contain more than one pin/signal, to allow more versatility, also it
can be device specific and further extending static structures (ie.
layout) caused more troubles than good.

I will send the patches with SWD update next week, but still I have
problems to make things work as expected - ie. right now, at
initialization, I get &quot;bug error&quot; that target is out of bouns, while I
do not initialize any target ;-)

Best regards,
Tomek
