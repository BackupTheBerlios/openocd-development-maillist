What do you concern under &quot;dump_image&quot; ? A command that dumps image ?
To be honest, I did not try it for MIPS, but there are some people on
the list who did (after my patch was applied, I think).

Point is that nothing worked, not only dump_image. Simply told, memory
write/read was byte-inversed - so you can say goodbye to the SDRAM
configuration, to start with. We were not even capable to load image,
far away from dumping it...

&gt;<i> Since you revert this change, same issue again :)
</I>
It's not an issue, it's a feature ;).

Now that we come again to this point, could it be that MIPS JTAGs
sometimes take microcode in big endian ? I have noticed that one
implementation works for some people, and represents &quot;bytes flipped&quot;
issue for other...

Stefan,
if you wold like to go further investigating the issue, maybe you can
take look at small doc I wrote about MIPS EJTAG :
<A HREF="http://www.mail-archive.com/openocd-development@lists.berlios.de/msg16208.html.">http://www.mail-archive.com/openocd-development@lists.berlios.de/msg16208.html.</A>
It might be helpful. If you have some comments, they are very welcome.
I hope that I'll have some more time to craft it well and commit it
upstream one day :).

BR,
Drasko
