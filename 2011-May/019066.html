<PRE>Hello,

-A-
With 1149.1, hardware is available on table for testing. 
Openocd requires the introduction of a mode
&quot;tap enable on fly&quot; 
For doing that, at every device change :
- reset JTAG =&gt; jtag chain length is jrc tap length
- reprogram icepick (jrc) in order to include the required tap.
then the jtag chain is the jrc tap length + the length of selected tap.

Jrc is 6 bits length. For cortex_a dap length is 4 bits.
(jrc cannot be set in by pass)

drawback : when device is selected 40% only of bit transfer is dedicated to the device selected.

-B-
With 1149.7 :
Few hardware available for testing star... 
No openocd optimized hardware for the support of new command on TCK/TMSC.

Openocd requires :
- CJTAG adaptation for these commands (at initialization, at star selection)

Gain , the length of jrc tap can be remove.
Risk : hardware availability


So regarding hardware availability, the safest is 1149.1 and for 
openocd adaptation , part of the stuff done for step A , can be re-used for step B.

Best regards

</I>Hello Michel,

I had a look at the 1149.7 standard which seemed very promising at first.

However, a couple of issues give me the impression that 1149.1 is the 
safest approach :

1- No support in OpenOCD. I guess this should't be too much of an issue 
since only the JTAG driver would need to be rewritten. The ZBS is 
already implemented (simply a special &quot;pathmove&quot; sequence). Therefore, 
only the escape sequences where TMS is used as a clock while holding TCK 
at '1' really needs to be added.

2- JTAG adapter lack of support for 1149.7 features. I currently have a 
JLink adapter, and I'm afraid the 'TMS as clock' feature is not handled 
as efficiently as a normal TDI/TMS scan (a separate command is necessary 
to change the value of TMS, whereas a scan operation can be performed in 
bulk). However, I don't know how much of a performance hit I should 
expect from this...
Can you comment on this ?
Do you know if other adapters would handle this better ?

Do you think those issues justify sticking with 1149.1 or am I being too 
conservative ?

Kind regards,
S&#233;bastien.
