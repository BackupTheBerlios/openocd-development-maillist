</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your much appreciated quick response.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm using my own .cfg for file an Olimex Tiny. I simply added the
</I>&gt;<i> suggested 'adapter_khz' (with value 1000, although I'm not sure what a
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable value would be; I guess that depends on the target) and
</I>&gt;<i> everything now works as before.
</I>&gt;<i> I guess I was a bit thrown off by mentioning of adding function calls
</I>&gt;<i> to init routines and someone even mentioned mods to core.c.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> As for cleaning stuff up and keeping code tidy, I certainly can see
</I>&gt;<i> your point there, but I still think 'breaking' things should only be
</I>&gt;<i> allowed in extreme situations, IMHO, and then only with very clear
</I>&gt;<i> instructions on how to adapt to the new situation.
</I>&gt;<i> In this case, a system that didn't work for all cases (but did for
</I>&gt;<i> most), was replaced with one that didn't work for ANY. That's hardly
</I>&gt;<i> progress. Besides, the concept of (a documented!) default value that
</I>&gt;<i> works in many, but not all, cases seems like a very valid thing to
</I>&gt;<i> have, to me.
</I>The problem is that the default value would have to be ridiculous low -
IIRC, for a synthesized core running at 32kHz, it would have to be 4kHz
or lower, so most users would *have* to edit their configs anyway to put
in a value that works for their board.

Otherwise, you get strange results, including &quot;works part of the time&quot;
or &quot;works partially&quot;. A clear error message is the much better solution
IMHO.

&gt;<i> Also, the one making this change must have realized that without also
</I>&gt;<i> fixing all the now broken sample scripts/cfg files, the implemented
</I>&gt;<i> solution wasn't complete and would trip up quite a few people. I
</I>&gt;<i> realize that fixing cfg files isn't very sexy, but still
</I>The change happened not long time ago - the master branch is work in
progress. I agree this definitely has to be cleaned up before the next
release.

&gt;<i> I also realize that it seems a bit ungrateful to bitch about work
</I>&gt;<i> that's done by volunteers, for free. Let me assure everyone that I
</I>&gt;<i> only mention this in an effort to help create a better product, and I
</I>&gt;<i> hope to one day contribute some of my own resources.
</I>&gt;<i> Despite the bitching, I truly DO thoroughly appreciated everyone's
</I>&gt;<i> efforts put into this cool tool!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>That's fine. Every bit helps - if you supply a patch that improves one
ore more of the supplied sample scripts, or even the documentation, that
will help improve OpenOCD without digging into the code.
