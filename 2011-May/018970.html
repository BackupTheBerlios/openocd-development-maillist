</I>I think you can still connect to the target to look at the call stack
and PC after it crashes.

When I want to look at the call stack and PC at a special code line, I
usually set a breakpoint from GDB, that will requires to halt the
target first.

&gt;<i> It's not a good idea to force everyone to halt their target when

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, it won't be a good idea to force everyone to halt their target if
they usually don't. But it will also not be a good idea if people
manually halt their target in most cases. GDB expects the target to be
stopped when it connects to the target. But OpenOCD has this feature
for several years, I think there must be some reasons. I'm trying to
understand them.

&gt;<i> In your case I think it would be the best to write a &quot;gdb-attach&quot; event
</I>&gt;<i> in your script and you can do whatever you want, like resetting the CPU,
</I>&gt;<i> blink LED's in this script.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>This is what I'm currently doing. But I'm not sure if it's the correct
thing to do since most of the board config files have &quot;reset init&quot; for
their gdb-attach event, not &quot;halt&quot;, except u8500.cfg.
