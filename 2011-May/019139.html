<PRE>hi,
 &gt; As far as I remember I had the support of the dcc in U-Boot much later.
I am sorry but I can't understand your meaning. Are you mean only the 
version of u-boot &gt; 1.3.2 support dcc?

 &gt; Do you use a mini2440?
Oh no. I use Uptech2410 board based on samsung s3c2410. I think you can 
hardly find information about this board. Uptech is a Chinese company 
and the service it provided is very very bad. The only thing it provided 
me useful is the modification patch for u-boot 1.3.2. According to that 
patch, I believe this board is very similar to smdk2410, the difference 
is uptech2410 has no NOR flash and it also has a cheaper NIC.

 &gt; It's looks like a pll init issue
 &gt; are you about them?
I wrote the initialization code of PLL and SDRAM in the procedure 
&quot;reset-init&quot;, so if I cannot execute &quot;reset init&quot;, my initialization 
code woun't be executed. You can see that code from my previous emails. 
I extracted that code from the example project provided by the CD disk 
of that board. Those example projects are written by ADS.

I think I have to say something more. If I wrote
&quot;
init
halt
&quot;

in openocd.cfg, the board can be halted as I said before. But when I 
download u-boot image into my board with wiggler, the &quot;current line&quot; 
feature is unavailable(I also said this in the previous post). But I 
missed one thing in that email: the &quot;disassemble window&quot; told me all 
instructions are UNKNOWN(0xffffffff). I think although wiggler can 
download image to board, the image is still incorrect.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. jlink: I can run &quot;reset&quot;, &quot;reset halt&quot;, &quot;reset init&quot; command

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spelling is incorrect, I am not in Linux now) and then tried to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> debug my u-boot in eclipse, the download progress can finished
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without any error, but in fact, the program cannot be executed. It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> always stopped with a SIGNAL. Even I run resume in OpenOCD, it also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cannot be executed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. I don't know why this happened, but some days before, &quot;reset&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> command cannot be done if I use wiggler cable to debug my board.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are always some errors when I execute &quot;reset&quot;, &quot;reset halt&quot; or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;reset init&quot; and my board cannot be reset. But at that time, I can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> run &quot;halt&quot; command and debug my u-boot in eclipse, the only problem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is the &quot;current line&quot; function cannot work property, I mean, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> line which highlighted in eclipse is not the line currently run.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe you can find this in one of my before email. Maybe this is
