Hi All,

although I have not tested the patch yet, I generally support the idea as such.

Some general notes about the JTAG drivers:

When I was about to implement support for PRESTO, I found out that there was
no well defined API for low level JTAG interface driver, except of the fully
synchronous bitbang.c. (by &quot;low level driver&quot; I mean driver handling JTAG interface at bit level,
without processing of higher commands).

I believe that it is not very good idea to do common JTAG stuff in the low level driver,
because this, among other cons, results in repeating and maintaining similar code on several places,
and unnecessarily increases complexity of the driver.

That is why I created bitq.c as an attempt separate higher stuff from the hw specific IO routines and to define minimal,
but yet generic enough API for low level JTAG interface driver with queued processing.

I have to admit that I did not like the value checking part of code in bitq.c at all,
but it was put there to minimize changes to OpenOCD - I just folowed the already implemented concept of JTAG drivers.

In my opinion, it is a good idea to further simplify this, but to cleanly define the driver API at levels:
type 1: driver fully implementing jtag_interface_t, typically making use of some hardware acceleration
type 2: low level driver, without special processing of higher JTAG commands
   a) synchronous implementing jtag_interface_t using bitbang.c and implementing instance of bitbang_interface_t
   b) queued one implementing jtag_interface_t using bitq.c and implementing instance of bitq_interface_t

Most of the JTAG interfaces used on PC fit into the type 2,
however there are currently several drivers which fit but do not take this approach.
Typical example is ft2232.c, have a look look at ft2232_execute_queue().
I believe that reimplementing this huge switch statement in the driver over and over
without real reason (e.g. hw assisted processing of high level commands) is something very wrong -
low level driver (type 2, or call it &quot;minidriver&quot;?) shall not contain any higher JTAG logic.
FT2232 driver may be cleanly implemented using bitq, and similar comment is applicable to several other drivers.

I think that the low level driver API has to be well defined to prevent unnecessary reimplementation
of higher JTAG processing inside drivers. What do you think, is this the way we shall go?

Back to the original topic: I am going to test the patch with PRESTO,
which is probably the only low level driver in the repository which makes use of bitq
and I will report the results soon.

Best regards,

Pavel
