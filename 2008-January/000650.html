<PRE>&gt;<i> I think statemove really should do just what it already does - move from one 
</I>&gt;<i> stable state to another stable state, using the shortest path that 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't &quot;violate&quot; any aspect of the standard (like multiple cycles in R-T/I, 
</I>&gt;<i> passing through more than Capture-XX or Update-XX state, ...). The idea 
</I>&gt;<i> behind this is to allow JTAG interfaces with free-running clocks, that the 
</I>&gt;<i> JTAG standard allows. Not sure if we'll ever see one, but I guess having that 
</I>&gt;<i> possibility doesn't hurt either.
</I>
I see. If someone chooses to use statemove in an application, then it 
must be enough that the system makes the move through whatever route, as 
long as that route does not violate the JTAG standard. Also, taking into 
account the main purpose of OpenOCD (ARM debugging), if statemove works 
with ARM cores, then everything is just fine.

So, while in theory there should not be any difference between statemove 
and pathmove (statemove can always be realized by pathmove), there is a 
practical reason to have the two.

&gt;<i> If a user of the JTAG layer, like XScale or (X)SVF places additional 
</I>&gt;<i> restrictions on the states that may be passed through, pathmove is the right 
</I>&gt;<i> choice.
</I>
Right. However, in many cases (at least with (X)SVF) the application 
needs to do some work to find out that route. But maybe that is 
something that has to be done at the higher level, even though it may 
require replicating some work done at other places.

The only problem I have right now is how to make the &quot;five 1's&quot; (or &quot;at 
least five 1's&quot;). It seems that even jtag_add_reset() just adds a 
statemove to TLR, which -- if I've understood correctly -- may be 
implemented in a number of ways depending on the HW driver.

Can we relay upon the driver to use at least five 1's when it encounters 
a statemove to TLR? If not, then I think something like 
jtag_add_forcereset() should be implemented in jtag.c by using 
pathmoves. Implementing that on a higher level would clutter the 
structure, and the five-bit reset is a generic JTAG operation.

---

Anyway, thanks for the explanation about statemove, pathmove, and the 
rationale behind them, now I know a bit more!

- Ville
