<PRE>Hello, all!

I am in rather desperate need of SVF support for some CPLD devices. I 
have not found a good open source program (with reasonable licensing 
scheme) for this purpose, but OpenOCD has the XSVF support. (With which, 
BTW, I had some problems, it runs ok but does not program the chip. The 
problem may be in the Xilinx SVF2XSVF converter, though.)

I recognize the fact that as OpenOCD is an open source project, I cannot 
just ask someone to do some work for free, I need to roll my own. What I 
have done this far is that I have written a SVF parser with flex and 
bison, and I am now trying to get the necessary parts out of xsvf.c to 
get something functional. I'm hoping to get something working within a 
few days.

However, I have a few challenges. I can overcome them in my own 
implementation, but in order to make something generally useful, I may 
need some help:

- I know next to nothing about the workings of GNU autotools. So, if 
someone is interested in looking into that, it would be great (I know 
how to patch the Makefile, but that'll result something only working in 
my own environment).

- I am doing the development on OS X Leopard, which means that some 
testing is required on other platforms, too (e.g. I only have bison and 
flex, no yacc and lex).

- I only have some FT2232-based USB programming adapters. Even though 
this should not be a problem, nothing else can be tested by me.

- I am planning to make a new subdirectory under src (src/svf) which 
would contain the necessary sources (svf.y, svf.l, svf.c, svf.h) 
similarly to the xsvf subdirectory. Is this a good idea, or should I 
integrate everything (xsvf and svf) into the same place?


Any ideas and suggestions are welcome!

Best regards,

- Ville
