<PRE>New subject from &quot;synthesize in_check_mask/value and error handler
using in_handler&quot;...

&gt;<i> I though Dominic was due todo some testing before committing to svn?
</I>
All he said in this thread was that he didn't have a chance to have a
look at it.

&gt;<i> The idea is good, but i also was hoping to find some time to perform some
</I>&gt;<i> testing this week.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any significant patches/updates should be signed off before committing to
</I>&gt;<i> svn - in my view that is.
</I>
Is there anything written up w.r.t. commit policy?

I think Michael is doing a great job and *certainly* does not
deserve a slap on the wrist :-) Both in terms of the amount of effort and
time he dedicates + the testing that he does. I don't know who would have
stepped up to fill his role, but without his tireless efforts I would have given
up on submitting patches to OpenOCD. Go Michael! :-)

It seems to me that OpenOCD needs a commit policy that is in sync
with how much resources the commiters can dedicate to the project
at any one time.

I think that those that *do* dedicate time and effort at any
one time should have a pretty free hand and big say(objecting to and
voting for) w.r.t. what happens with patches.  OpenOCD suffers
more from lack of attention than too much instability/ad hoc
design changes.
