&gt;<i> The only advantage I see is that the tables are small enough to be edited by hand.
</I>
Which is a huge advantage. It is all too easy to make a small mistake in 
the manual labor, and then we have a lot of extremely odd errors.

&gt;<i> It might be possible to use such table directly at runtime,
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know whether generating the tables described below
</I>&gt;<i> brings significant savings, maybe when running on an embedded target.
</I>
As an embedded programmer myself, I would use exactly 256 octets for 
this purpose. The code required to decode the 32-octet version (pure bit 
table) is slow and requires more code that the advantages are lost.

&gt;<i> Yes, it does. I would vote for generating this full transition table from the 16x16 table
</I>&gt;<i> upon start, I assume this shall be quite instant when optimized - shorter transitions are subsets of longer ones.
</I>
One point here: The table is not going to be edited, ever. So, including 
some extra code may not be justified just to make it look better. The 
time taken to generate the table in the fly is not a problem, anyway, 
but the extra space and code may not provide anything extra. Also, the 
&quot;opened up&quot; table may make the code simpler to understand.

However, I think it is wise not to manually create all routes, as 
getting 2048 bits right manually is something that I do not see happen...

If there are no objections at this point, I'll start creating the table. 
Then I hope other people will participate into incorporating it.
