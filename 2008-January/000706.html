Hello &#216;yvind,

&#216;yvind Harboe napsal(a):
&gt;<i> &quot;Driver knows best&quot; and explicit probe are not mutually exclusive. The driver
</I>&gt;<i> could be told(and there are several ways to do this of course) that this is
</I>&gt;<i> an explicit probe.
</I> &gt;
&gt;<i> At this moment I'm leaning towards a &quot;clearProbe()&quot; function in the flash API
</I>&gt;<i> that is implemented by the driver and is only invoked by the &quot;flash probe&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> command.
</I>
Your note from one of the previous posts: &quot;- keep probe() API as-is today&quot;
If is it properly modified, the ok, but I still feel the probed flag to be a better solution.

&gt;&gt;<i> Otherwise if a decision is made to do autoprobing unconditionally I am for implementing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;flash autoprobe enable/disable&quot; command.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No more unecessary and obscure options! :-)
</I>
Sure, I feel the same ;-)

&gt;<i> Only developers of OpenOCD would need to disable autoprobe and they can
</I>&gt;<i> do so via source code modification, right?
</I>
Well, everyone who desires fast flash programming would need patching it,
as calling probe over and over slows things down (depends on driver).
And an example: the loader I have published in the forum before I use for fast SAM7 programming
there is an application running on the chip which communicates with generic &quot;OCL (on-chip-loader)&quot;
flash driver using DCC. Having probe called over and over is highly undesired in this case and I consider
doing a solution against this in the driver to be a hack.

&gt;<i> The source code is the ultimate in configurability, but of course it is tricky
</I>&gt;<i> to use. The command set should be easy to use and offer necessary
</I>&gt;<i> configuration options for almost all users.
</I>
I do not share this point of view because of convenience:
Surely, all &quot;users&quot; of OpenOCD are software developers,
an probably know how to compile it, but it is really inconvenient to do this.
This approach takes advantage of the source shared among the community
but pushes users to &quot;use their own playground&quot; rather than contribute.
Uncommited patches, despite sent to forum got lost and forgotten, and thus are not
of any use for others than the author, that is my personal opinion.
It seems to me pretty weird to gain convenience of autoprobe by sacrificing convenience
for other users who might then need to patch and recompile.

An if I were ironic: there is the source: if anyone is too lazy to do proper configuration of
OpenOCD to include &quot;flash probe&quot;, he/she can patch the sources - why should we repair
something that already works? (Please do not take this as my actual standpoint,
it is just a strict interpretation of &quot;there is the source&quot;.)

&gt;&gt;<i> To summarize it, I am not against flash autoprobing, if it is done as last resort option in really necessary cases
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (explicit probe was not done yet upon an attempt to erase/write flash memory),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or if it can be optionally turned off.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand why you would want flash operations to fail rather than
</I>&gt;<i> just probe the flash.
</I>
Well, I don't... I never stated anything like that, this is a misunderstanding,
but probe should be called only if needed (if bank was not probed before -  least invasive solution in my opinion).

&gt;<i> Caching is bad in terms of creating more code paths, but good in terms
</I>&gt;<i> of performance.
</I>
Performance matters, flashing of larger memories may take tens of seconds.
Actually, it is not caching as usually understood. The flash susbystem of OpenOCD
is designed to remember information about flash banks once configure (and probed, if needed).
As I understood, probing barely needs to be run more than once.
