<PRE>Another concern I have is that if response isn't reasonably
snappy, then there are some real negative effects:

- it's not as fun! this is an open source project and making
this project fun I think is crucial to make it succeed.
- patches get out of sync. Having to resync patches to trunk is
boring work. Especially if testing has to be repeated!
- other work is held up. Since this is an open source project
there will be windows of time to work on it that come for
maintainers/patchers. Once that window of time has come and
gone, it never comes back. There is no &quot;do it next week&quot;
as there is if it was a day-job, when I had time to do
&quot;tonight&quot;.


And again: there is no honor lost in backing out a bad change
to Subversion.

I would like to view openocd trunk as a work in progress. If
OpenOCD introduces a concept of releases, then a branch
should be cut from an openocd trunk version and changes from trunk
should be applied to that trunk to stablize a release. I'm not
a big believer in releases for openocd because it does not seem
like there is enough resources to handle more than keeping
trunk going.

W.r.t. releases, I think perhaps we should observe stability / work
on main trunk and then vote for a latest recommended version
of openocd trunk. Anything earlier and you have bugs that have
been fixed any later and you have work that isn't done yet.

Perhaps a &quot;snapshot&quot; is a better concept than release. Cut a
snapshot(create a branch) from a openocd trunk version you
believe in(subversion copy), post a mail that a new snapshot
has been cut and if nobody complains within, say, 2-3
weeks, recommend it on the web site.
