Hello &#216;yvind, Mangus and the list,

&#216;yvind Harboe napsal(a):
&gt;&gt;<i> I would suggest a &quot;sucessfully_probed&quot; flag in the flash driver structure.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the flash bank lookup, as in &#214;yvinds patch,, probe() is called if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this flag is unset but only for the requested flash bank.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem here is testing, this adds an extra code path, not that
</I>&gt;<i> I'm convinced we can avoid it.
</I>
Well, this is a single &quot;if&quot; statement. In my opinion it is often better to
see that it is ok, than just test it and leave it if it works under particular
test conditions, which means doing autoprobe in just necessary cases is the least invasive solution -
if we need a solution at all, as I understand, the flashing works, when OpenOCD is configured properly
and autoprobing is though of just for convenience, not as a necessity.
My point of view: If GDB issues vFlashWrite command on an unprobed bank, the best thing we could do is to call probe
and pray it will work - some flashes need e.g. precise timing, PLLs set the right, way which cannot be always assured.

Some counterarguments:

&gt;<i> - keep probe() API as-is today
</I>
Agreed, that also means not to break (slow down) it by calling probe over and over.

&gt;<i> - any driver that needs to implement a 'probed' flag
</I>&gt;<i> needs to do so themselves. As was pointed out it can be
</I>&gt;<i> very hard to say anything about when and how a probe must
</I>&gt;<i> take place and the driver knows best here.
</I>
It is hard for the driver to tell difference between explicit probe (flash probe command) and autoprobe.

&gt;<i> - without the 'probed' flag a driver will operate correctly but be
</I>&gt;<i> slower than it otherwise could have been
</I>
Actually, the driver will not operate any slower, rather the layer on top of it
is using the driver API the way it was not designed, see note above about keeping the API as-is.

&gt;<i> - if the time to perform a probe is insiginficant, then
</I>&gt;<i> executing a probe every time reduces the # of
</I>&gt;<i> code paths and is probably a better way to go
</I>
It reduces number of codepaths, but on the other hand
get_flash_bank_by_addr() has to call probing routine for ALL flash banks,
upon access of ANY of them, which means unnecessary long codepath, and in addition,
dependent on configuration of flash banks - hard to track
I mean, lowering number of codepaths at any cost might not be the best.

Note: do not take it as that I am against autoprobing in any case,
I am just trying to look at it from different point so that the best possible solution is used.

Pavel
