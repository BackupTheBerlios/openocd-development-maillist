Hello Ville,

Definitely.

</I>
Good idea, I wondered why there are those weird transition tables in jtag.c
from the first moment I looked into the sources. The savings by using this approach
are very disputable - we have plenty of memory ;-)
The only advantage I see is that the tables are small enough to be edited by hand.

&gt;<i> So, we need a table of 16x16 states and the information about the 
</I>&gt;<i> shortest path between the states. Then the TMS mechanism has to be made 
</I>&gt;<i> so that it can send variable-length bit strings.
</I>
Or if not the shortest path, lets say &quot;the default&quot;.

&gt;<i> What I am planning to do is to create a 16x16 bit table describing the 
</I>&gt;<i> next move towards the desired state.
</I>
...plus 16x2 integers state transition table to followed,
so that we can tell when we reached the desired state.

It might be possible to use such table directly at runtime,
I don't know whether generating the tables described below
brings significant savings, maybe when running on an embedded target.

&gt;<i> Then this table is used to create 
</I>&gt;<i> two 256-octet tables, one with the data (&quot;bits&quot;) and one with the data 
</I>&gt;<i> length. (Or then embed the length information into the bit strings, 
</I>&gt;<i> which is also possible.) This two-step approach should eliminate most 
</I>&gt;<i> stupid mistakes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would this make any sense?
</I>
Yes, it does. I would vote for generating this full transition table from the 16x16 table
upon start, I assume this shall be quite instant when optimized - shorter transitions are subsets of longer ones.
