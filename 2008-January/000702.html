<PRE>&gt;<i> Also the &quot;driver knows the best&quot; approach does not cover possible need of explicit probe.
</I>
&quot;Driver knows best&quot; and explicit probe are not mutually exclusive. The driver
could be told(and there are several ways to do this of course) that this is
an explicit probe.

At this moment I'm leaning towards a &quot;clearProbe()&quot; function in the flash API
that is implemented by the driver and is only invoked by the &quot;flash probe&quot;
command.

&gt;<i> Otherwise if a decision is made to do autoprobing unconditionally I am for implementing
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;flash autoprobe enable/disable&quot; command.
</I>
No more unecessary and obscure options! :-)

Only developers of OpenOCD would need to disable autoprobe and they can
do so via source code modification, right?

&gt;<i> Note for the &quot;why another command&quot; objections&quot;: why not having this one if we have &quot;gdb flash program enable/disable&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> which makes only a little sense as GDB does not issue flashing commands unless it get proper memory map? Never mind.
</I>
My thinking is that the gdb flash programming should be on always.

If someone does not want this(why???) then there is always the
source. I can understand that it is not on by default currently
because it is a new feature that is still being tinkered with.

Once the gdb memory map + flash programming feature has been
stable for &gt; 1 month, I think it is time to make it on always.

&gt;<i> I feel like one of the strongest points of OpenOCD is its versatility and flexible configuration,
</I>&gt;<i> which decreases a bit with every operation which OpenOCD does without users desire.
</I>
OpenOCD is already pretty vile in terms of the # of and complexity of commands
that it has. I'm all for reducing this complexity when oportunity arises.

The source code is the ultimate in configurability, but of course it is tricky
to use. The command set should be easy to use and offer necessary
configuration options for almost all users.



&gt;<i>I feel like one of the strongest points of OpenOCD is its versatility
</I>&gt;<i> and flexible configuration, which decreases a bit with every operation
</I>&gt;<i> which OpenOCD does without users desire.
</I>
I don't agree with this at all. I think one of the weakest OpenOCD
points is that it has a lots of options that the user has to tinker with.

I'm convinced that with a bit of thought and patience the autoprobe question
can be put to bed  once and for all to everyones satisfication
without more commands/options.

&gt;<i> To summarize it, I am not against flash autoprobing, if it is done as last resort option in really necessary cases
</I>&gt;<i> (explicit probe was not done yet upon an attempt to erase/write flash memory),
</I>&gt;<i> or if it can be optionally turned off.
</I>
I don't understand why you would want flash operations to fail rather than
just probe the flash.

Caching is bad in terms of creating more code paths, but good in terms
of performance.
