No, but it works with all the ARM7/9 targets, and persumably Cortex as well. 
It's a rather popular design that I'm still considering to include, and other 
JTAG interfaces, especially parallel-port based designs, could place similar 
restrictions, because this design allows TMS scans with a single access, 
instead of two or more accesses specifying the number of bits and the data.

Regarding the issue of fully populated state transition tables etc.:

I think statemove really should do just what it already does - move from one 
stable state to another stable state, using the shortest path that 
doesn't &quot;violate&quot; any aspect of the standard (like multiple cycles in R-T/I, 
passing through more than Capture-XX or Update-XX state, ...). The idea 
behind this is to allow JTAG interfaces with free-running clocks, that the 
JTAG standard allows. Not sure if we'll ever see one, but I guess having that 
possibility doesn't hurt either.

In this case it really doesn't matter how the TMS transitions are 
implemented - the 7-bit table is there for historical reasons, but a driver 
is free to implement it differently. Before that &quot;7-bit device&quot; I had a 6x6xN 
table with N TMS values of 1 and 0, and -1 to indicate the end of a 
particular TMS sequence.

If a user of the JTAG layer, like XScale or (X)SVF places additional 
restrictions on the states that may be passed through, pathmove is the right 
choice. In the XScale case we need both ways through the state machine - 
going from Capture-DR through to Shift-DR, as well as taking the route via 
Exit1-DR, Pause-DR, Exit2-DR to Shift-DR. This means there's a bug in the 
current XScale code that needs fixing - in xscale_read_tx if we don't want to 
consume the register content we shouldn't use a statemove with its implied 
behaviour, but rather a statemove.

The point is that statemove always is implied behaviour, and only should be 
used when we don't care. All statemove has to do is follow the JTAG standard.
Pathmove is for the special cases, where we don't want any implied behaviour.

If the pathmove layer or is broken we should fix it. If the fallback code is 
broken we should fix it, too, and on top of that a user of the pathmove 
support should fail and complain if support_pathmove is 0.

Regards,

Dominic
