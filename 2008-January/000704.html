At some point the usability is so bad it becomes a necessity. Trying to
solving this problem in the manual and expecting the user to get this
right is just
not realisitic.

Your objection seems to be that an explicit probe is no longer is
possible. That's
wrong.

You can manually issue a &quot;flash probe&quot; when you want it to happen and
start GDB afterwards.

&gt;<i> Some counterarguments:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - keep probe() API as-is today
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, that also means not to break (slow down) it by calling probe over and over.
</I>
A slowdown of 10-20% is acceptable if it puts lots of other issues to bed.

&gt;<i> &gt; - any driver that needs to implement a 'probed' flag
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; needs to do so themselves. As was pointed out it can be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very hard to say anything about when and how a probe must
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; take place and the driver knows best here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is hard for the driver to tell difference between explicit probe (flash probe command) and autoprobe.
</I>
Wrong. An explicit fn would be introduced(clearProbeCache() or some
equivalent). Autoprobe
entails API changes.

&gt;<i> It reduces number of codepaths, but on the other hand
</I>&gt;<i> get_flash_bank_by_addr() has to call probing routine for ALL flash banks,
</I>&gt;<i> upon access of ANY of them, which means unnecessary long codepath, and in addition,
</I>&gt;<i> dependent on configuration of flash banks - hard to track
</I>&gt;<i> I mean, lowering number of codepaths at any cost might not be the best.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note: do not take it as that I am against autoprobing in any case,
</I>&gt;<i> I am just trying to look at it from different point so that the best possible solution is used.
</I>
I think at this point there is a consensus that autoprobe should include caching
*and* explicit flash probe.
