<PRE>This is a writeup of the problems while they are still fresh in
my mind.

There are certain situations where GDB gets stuck/crashes
waiting for OpenOCD.

Here I'm using the words &quot;crash&quot; and &quot;stuck&quot;
in the sense that the user can not tell the difference between
OpenOCD doing the correct thing and being unresponsive and
OpenOCD being outright broken and being unresponsive. To
the user these two situations are indistinguishable.

The problem is that the GUI on top of GDB will issue a
request to display memory and GDB will respond to
that request. This request can be *large*.

This can be tied to e.g. mouseover, so the user doesn't
even know that requests are going to the target to examine
memory willy nilly.

This is made worse when debugging -O3 code where
GDB oftentimes has local variables pointing to garbage.

Some situations:

- mouseover causing *large* memory reads. Consider the
global structure below. When moving the mouse over any
text containing &quot;foo&quot;, the GUI will cause a request to
read back the entire &quot;foo&quot; structure.

struct
{
  char buffer[1024*1024];
  int x;
} foo;

- A simular situation arises when the users explicitly opens
&quot;foo&quot; to look at &quot;x&quot;.

- Consider a watch expression &quot;*bar&quot; on the local variable below.
  It will frequently point to invalid memory.

int *bar;


What to do?

1. nothing, OpenOCD didn't do anything wrong. IMHO, this is
   unacceptable as OpenOCD is useless when debugging certain
   applications that are prone to the problems above.
2. fail larger memory reads from GDB. Add maxsize option.
   Yuk! This maxsize could be based on time rather than quantity.
3. cache target memory. Type &quot;help mem&quot; to see information
   about how to make GDB cache memory. Could this
  be built into the target.xml support? I wouldn't expect
  users to be able to find this sort of documentation and
  take advantage of it, so it would have to be automatic
  somehow.

Faster memory reads/caching would help, but not entirely
fix, the problem. Still I favour getting automatic GDB caching in
place.
