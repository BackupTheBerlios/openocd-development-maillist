<PRE>Hi Mangus and the list,

Magnus Lundin napsal(a):
&gt;<i> I cannot see any principal problem with auto probing,  if I declare a 
</I>&gt;<i> flash bank then the system should
</I>&gt;<i> check the communication and information that is supplied from the flash 
</I>&gt;<i> without any explicit probe command being necessary.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There can be some issues  on where and when to issue this (auto) probe 
</I>&gt;<i> command. This is related to some recent thoughts and
</I>&gt;<i> discussions about the configuration process and config files. More to 
</I>&gt;<i> the point, when can we be sure that jtag and target communications
</I>&gt;<i> are up and running  so that the probe is meaningful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My suspicion is that this makes &quot;handle_flash_bank_command&quot; a bad choise.
</I>
Good point, I am strongly against doing this in handle_flash_bank_command.

&gt;<i> &#214;yvinds patch that checks all flash banks at every access is a bit heavy 
</I>&gt;<i> handed.
</I>
It is, I have to admit I don't like this solution much.
Unfortunately probing of all flash banks is necessary
in get_flash_bank_by_addr otherwise it cannot return meaningful result.
That is also why I think that the &quot;probed&quot; flag is a good solution.

&gt;<i> I would suggest a &quot;sucessfully_probed&quot; flag in the flash driver structure.
</I>&gt;<i> In the flash bank lookup, as in &#214;yvinds patch,, probe() is called if 
</I>&gt;<i> this flag is unset but only for the requested flash bank.
</I>
I like this idea, despite &#216;yvind noted that &quot;driver knows the best&quot;.
Well, technically speaking, with proper design, we would not need the probe command at all if &quot;driver knows the best&quot;
as it can arrange everything in the erase/write routine, however, this is probably not a good way to go.
Also the &quot;driver knows the best&quot; approach does not cover possible need of explicit probe.
The probing should be done in any case, unconditionally whenever &quot;flash probe&quot; command is issued,
but the driver cannot tell whether the probe is explicit or automatic without changing driver interface.
So I am rather for the &quot;probed&quot; flag.

Otherwise if a decision is made to do autoprobing unconditionally I am for implementing
&quot;flash autoprobe enable/disable&quot; command.
Note for the &quot;why another command&quot; objections&quot;: why not having this one if we have &quot;gdb flash program enable/disable&quot;
which makes only a little sense as GDB does not issue flashing commands unless it get proper memory map? Never mind.

I feel like one of the strongest points of OpenOCD is its versatility and flexible configuration,
which decreases a bit with every operation which OpenOCD does without users desire.
To summarize it, I am not against flash autoprobing, if it is done as last resort option in really necessary cases
(explicit probe was not done yet upon an attempt to erase/write flash memory),
or if it can be optionally turned off.

Pavel
