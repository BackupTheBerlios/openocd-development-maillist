</I>&gt;<i> Betreff: Re: [Openocd-development] Possible problems with autoprobe
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; Also the &quot;driver knows the best&quot; approach does not cover possible need
</I>&gt;<i> of explicit probe.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Driver knows best&quot; and explicit probe are not mutually exclusive. The
</I>&gt;<i> driver
</I>&gt;<i> could be told(and there are several ways to do this of course) that this
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> an explicit probe.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At this moment I'm leaning towards a &quot;clearProbe()&quot; function in the
</I>&gt;<i> flash API that is implemented by the driver and is only invoked by
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;flash probe&quot; command.
</I>
Please stay with the current coding style, and call it &quot;clear_probe()&quot;, if you're going to implement this.

&gt;<i> &gt; Otherwise if a decision is made to do autoprobing unconditionally I am
</I>&gt;<i> for implementing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;flash autoprobe enable/disable&quot; command.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No more unecessary and obscure options! :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Only developers of OpenOCD would need to disable autoprobe and they can
</I>&gt;<i> do so via source code modification, right?
</I>
&gt;<i> My thinking is that the gdb flash programming should be on always.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If someone does not want this(why???) then there is always the
</I>&gt;<i> source. I can understand that it is not on by default currently
</I>&gt;<i> because it is a new feature that is still being tinkered with.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Once the gdb memory map + flash programming feature has been
</I>&gt;<i> stable for &gt; 1 month, I think it is time to make it on always.
</I>
Agreed.

&gt;<i> &gt;I feel like one of the strongest points of OpenOCD is its versatility
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and flexible configuration, which decreases a bit with every operation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which OpenOCD does without users desire.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't agree with this at all. I think one of the weakest OpenOCD
</I>&gt;<i> points is that it has a lots of options that the user has to tinker with.
</I>
The OpenOCD was always intended as a tool for people who know what they're doing, providing a level of functionality similar to the BDI2000 for example. I'm open to making the OpenOCD more user friendly as long as those changes don't cause any unintended behaviour, just because some command tries to be more clever than the user. There's a whole operating system for that clientele...

I've had the chance to work with several commercial development environments since I finished my studies, and while all those convenience feaures are nice as long as everything works as expected (expected by the devtools developer, that is...), I found it horrible to understand what was going on as soon as things didn't just work...

&gt;<i> I'm convinced that with a bit of thought and patience the autoprobe
</I>&gt;<i> question
</I>&gt;<i> can be put to bed  once and for all to everyones satisfication
</I>&gt;<i> without more commands/options.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To summarize it, I am not against flash autoprobing, if it is done as
</I>&gt;<i> last resort option in really necessary cases
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (explicit probe was not done yet upon an attempt to erase/write flash
</I>&gt;<i> memory),
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or if it can be optionally turned off.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand why you would want flash operations to fail rather
</I>&gt;<i> than just probe the flash.
</I>
Probing CFI flash for example causes multiple writes to memory. I /dont/ want the debugger to blindly write some memory I didn't tell it to.

Targets with multiple external memory banks, caches and a MMU require a specific setup before the flash can be accessed. There's little use in probing such a system's flash before the user knowingly set up these pieces.

&gt;<i> Caching is bad in terms of creating more code paths, but good in terms
</I>&gt;<i> of performance.
