<PRE>I'm very happy with Michael taking care of commits. I hoped to find some more time during my christmas holidays, but that was only wishful thinking.

That said, I would still like to keep control over massive changes, but in
this particular case I already acknowledged the basic idea of the change, so I'm fine with it. Michael told me off-list that he had tested the patches, and I'm confident that his testing is better than my testing.

What I'd like to avoid is including patches that favor some commercial
interest over the interests of the majority of OpenOCD users (Wiggler +
FT2232 using only telnet or a real GDB) - like patches that are required to make the OpenOCD work (better) on Vendor X's hardware, while causing problems (performance degradation, loss of functionality) for others, or patches that affect the GDB remote protocol because of Vendor Y's frontend. &#216;yvind convinced me that this isn't the case with the synthesize... patch.

So no - just being active doesn't give ultimate say over what patches get
included, but at the moment it's probably better to just include it anyway. If we (myself, or anyone else) find something we don't like (for a reason) we can roll the changes back quite easily.

With more committers and less time on my side it might of course be necessary to create some commit rules, feel free to suggest something.

Best regards,

Dominic

</I>&gt;<i> Betreff: Commit policy
</I>
&gt;<i> New subject from &quot;synthesize in_check_mask/value and error handler
</I>&gt;<i> using in_handler&quot;...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I though Dominic was due todo some testing before committing to svn?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All he said in this thread was that he didn't have a chance to have a
</I>&gt;<i> look at it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The idea is good, but i also was hoping to find some time to perform
</I>&gt;<i> some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; testing this week.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Any significant patches/updates should be signed off before committing
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; svn - in my view that is.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is there anything written up w.r.t. commit policy?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think Michael is doing a great job and *certainly* does not
</I>&gt;<i> deserve a slap on the wrist :-) Both in terms of the amount of effort and
</I>&gt;<i> time he dedicates + the testing that he does. I don't know who would have
</I>&gt;<i> stepped up to fill his role, but without his tireless efforts I would have
</I>&gt;<i> given
</I>&gt;<i> up on submitting patches to OpenOCD. Go Michael! :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me that OpenOCD needs a commit policy that is in sync
</I>&gt;<i> with how much resources the commiters can dedicate to the project
</I>&gt;<i> at any one time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that those that *do* dedicate time and effort at any
</I>&gt;<i> one time should have a pretty free hand and big say(objecting to and
</I>&gt;<i> voting for) w.r.t. what happens with patches.  OpenOCD suffers
</I>&gt;<i> more from lack of attention than too much instability/ad hoc
</I>&gt;<i> design changes.
