<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; I though Dominic was due todo some testing before committing to svn?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All he said in this thread was that he didn't have a chance 
</I>&gt;<i> to have a look at it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Fair enough.

&gt;<i> &gt; The idea is good, but i also was hoping to find some time 
</I>&gt;<i> to perform 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some testing this week.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Any significant patches/updates should be signed off before 
</I>&gt;<i> committing 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to svn - in my view that is.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is there anything written up w.r.t. commit policy?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
No, but i think it is important that something is agreed upon for larger
commits.
It only has to be something simple - such as two dev's agree the changes are
ok.

&gt;<i> I think Michael is doing a great job and *certainly* does not 
</I>&gt;<i> deserve a slap on the wrist :-) Both in terms of the amount 
</I>&gt;<i> of effort and time he dedicates + the testing that he does. I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't know who would have stepped up to fill his role, but 
</I>&gt;<i> without his tireless efforts I would have given up on 
</I>&gt;<i> submitting patches to OpenOCD. Go Michael! :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I also agree Michael is doing a fantastic job, my comments were not aimed at
Michael or any other individual - more of a general comment. I apologise if
Michael has also read it as a individual attack, and in know way was
pointing the finger at anyone.

&gt;<i> It seems to me that OpenOCD needs a commit policy that is in 
</I>&gt;<i> sync with how much resources the committers can dedicate to 
</I>&gt;<i> the project at any one time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that those that *do* dedicate time and effort at any 
</I>&gt;<i> one time should have a pretty free hand and big say(objecting 
</I>&gt;<i> to and voting for) w.r.t. what happens with patches.  OpenOCD 
</I>&gt;<i> suffers more from lack of attention than too much 
</I>&gt;<i> instability/ad hoc design changes.
</I>
A free hand on smaller changes yes, but care has to be taken on larger
commits.

Cheers
Spen
