Hello Dominic and the list,

Dominic Rath napsal(a):
&gt;<i> The OpenOCD was always intended as a tool for people who know what they're doing, providing a level of functionality similar to the BDI2000 for example. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> open to making the OpenOCD more user friendly as long as those changes don't cause any unintended behaviour, just because some command tries to be more
</I>&gt;<i> clever than the user. There's a whole operating system for that clientele...
</I>
I share this opinion, BTW that is why I like OpenOCD ;-)

&gt;<i> I've had the chance to work with several commercial development environments since I finished my studies, and while all those convenience feaures are nice as
</I>&gt;<i> long as everything works as expected (expected by the devtools developer, that is...), I found it horrible to understand what was going on as soon as things
</I>&gt;<i> didn't just work...
</I>
&gt;<i> Probing CFI flash for example causes multiple writes to memory. I /dont/ want the debugger to blindly write some memory I didn't tell it to. 
</I>&gt;<i> Targets with multiple external memory banks, caches and a MMU require a specific setup before the flash can be accessed. There's little use in probing such a
</I>&gt;<i> system's flash before the user knowingly set up these pieces.
</I>
Very good point.
So if such behaviour is undesired, possible solutions which seem fine to me:

1) either have a way to enable/disable autoprobing, optimally on per bank basis
(extend flash_bank_s by autoprobe flag + some command or option to flash bank to enable/disable autoprobing

2) extend driver API by adding autoprobe() function and leave current probe intact.
This is IMO a better solution than clear_probe(), because it allows implementation of
driver with explicit probe only without necessity to maintain state variable in the driver.
Another advantage: for flash drivers which can be probed at any time, probe and autoprobe may point to the same function.

3) some kind of combination of the former two

Regards,
   Pavel
