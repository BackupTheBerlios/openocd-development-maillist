<PRE>&gt;<i> Is there a reason not to make the transition map
</I>&gt;<i> complete and to use the minimal # of clk's instead of the
</I>&gt;<i> fixed 7?
</I>
I second this one. It is not necessary when everyone plays by the book, 
but as this is not always the case, the system would become more robust. 


I know nothing about XScale, but I am looking at this problem from the 
SVF/XSVF point of view, which should provide a rather generic view into 
JTAG. What the SVF and XSVF seem to say is that we need the following 
state moves:

#1  from a state to a state next to it (XSVF and SVF)
#2  from one stable state to another (XSVF and SVF)
#3  from any state to reset by using the five 1's (XSVF)
#4  from any state to any stable state through the standard path (XSVF)

The last one is highly uncertain. The wording of the specification can 
be read in two different ways. The intention is clearly to mimic the SVF 
which would mean that #4 is not allowed, but then someone may read it in 
a different way.

The XSVF problems also mentioned on this list (rti-&gt;tlr transition 
error) are actually something that should never occur, as when there is 
a XSTATE 0x00, the five one's should be sent. So, tlr is always 
accessible in XSVF.

---

My suggestion is that we make the full state change diagram &quot;from any 
state to any state&quot; so that it also carries the transition length in 
bits. While this full state change table should not be required in 
principle, it may help in some cases.

So, we need a table of 16x16 states and the information about the 
shortest path between the states. Then the TMS mechanism has to be made 
so that it can send variable-length bit strings.

What I am planning to do is to create a 16x16 bit table describing the 
next move towards the desired state. Then this table is used to create 
two 256-octet tables, one with the data (&quot;bits&quot;) and one with the data 
length. (Or then embed the length information into the bit strings, 
which is also possible.) This two-step approach should eliminate most 
stupid mistakes.

Would this make any sense?
