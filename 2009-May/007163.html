Well, I am thinking of the J-Link code in particular, which I suppose is
more of a &quot;continuation&quot; condition. 

&gt;<i> I'd rather see the event loops structured better, so that each activity

I like the idea of threads, but that opens a new dimension of problems
for embedded systems (though none supported... today).  It would be nice
to be able to run OpenOCD in a single thread.

&gt;<i> I see messages about needing to increase some GDB timeout/interval.  But

</I>
I agree.  This is what I meant by retries.  If we're working on the
single thread model, no event/action can be allowed to take more than
MAX_TIME_SLICE, or you see those sorts of problems. I thought that
libusb worked in non-blocking mode, but perhaps I was wrong....

&gt;<i> Too bad that can't be fixed before the next release.  ;)
</I>
Yeah.  These are Big Changes.

Cheers,

Zach
