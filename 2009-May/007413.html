<PRE>Xiaofan Chen a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> 2009/5/27 Michel Catudal &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">michelcatudal at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It looks like my information on the NEC 32 bit devices was correct.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Today I had a 3hrs meeting with people trying to sell me on the PIC32
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with CAN.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can't go on details on this one due to NDA.  According to an Engineer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I talked to, the V850 core is a M4K core which is the same as the PIC32.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The main reason that Microchip has chosen MIPS over ARM is due to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fact that ARM would not accept for them to make the debug module compatible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with MPLAB which is very important for Microchip.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks a lot for the information. This is a myth for me. I always think
</I>&gt;<i> Microchip should have chosen ARM Cortex M3 core.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>What I am told it that they would have been forced to use the ARM7TDMI 
which they don't think is good for embedded controls and they
don't have the technology to use the Cortex-M3. The part about the ARM 
is not a myth, I got that from a Microchip Engineer.

&gt;&gt;<i> It will be interesting to see what NEC will do with the Renesas 8 bit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parts after the merger is complete. The k series from NEC is obviously
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> superior.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think Renesas will be the dominated player once the merger is done.
</I>&gt;<i> Renesas's emphasis seems to be push down the 16bit series
</I>&gt;<i> R8C/H8-300H Tiny to compete the 8-bit market. But NEC 78K may
</I>&gt;<i> indeed be stronger in the 8-bit market than the Renesas' existing
</I>&gt;<i> 8-bit solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I don't know about that, the 8 bit, 16 bit and 32 bit parts share a 
common set of peripherals. We may choose them over the competitor not
just for prices but because of that. We need high end devices for 
Clusters and low end for cheap gauges, it would be nice to use the same
drivers and just have to recompile. I have seen prices in the 32 bit 
that are competitive with 8 bits and 16 bits devices.
It looks to me like the merger is being forced by the Japanese 
government and at the end NEC will win. The context switching in the NEC 
devices has no match.
Find me a 32 bits processor that takes 4 cycles to get to an interrupt. 
This is something that NEC has had for a long time in all their devices 
since the k8 and V25.
