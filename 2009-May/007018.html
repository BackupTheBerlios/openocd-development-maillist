Yes please.  I have some DaVinci DM355 EVM board support
that raises the same issues.  And when I poked at your web
page it wasn't quite clear where you were proposing things
sit, so I didn't get back to that ...

What I started with was

 src/target/board/dm355evm.cfg  |  111 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 src/target/target/davinci.cfg  |  170 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 src/target/target/ti_dm355.cfg |   34 +++++++-
 3 files changed, 314 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)

Expecting &quot;davinci.cfg&quot; to grow dm6446 support later;
and a dm6446evm.cfg with some incoming config option
to say whether to set it up to talk to NOR, NAND, or
no-flash-at-all.

I may just post that as an RFC, so you can see it;
the use of dictionaries to hold some SoC-variant
stuff may be a useful model.

Then someone pointed me at the almost invisible stuff
in src/tcl ... which I'm not quite sure I like, since
among other things it seems to abuse globals (making
multi-cpu configs be forever painful).  But maybe some
files like src/tcl/chip/ti/davinci/*.cfg would be good,
and the &quot;memread32&quot; resembles something I had to create.
