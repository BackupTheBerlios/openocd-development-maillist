There are well-documented reasons posted on the interwebs:

  <A HREF="http://www.unicom.com/pw/reply-to-harmful.html">http://www.unicom.com/pw/reply-to-harmful.html</A>

That is the first hit for me when searching for &quot;mailing list reply-to&quot;.

</I>
I basically agree with this assessment, but I think &#216;yvind needs to make
this decision and revert the patches himself.  Other maintainers may
feel comfortable taking such actions, but I do not endorse interfering
with another maintainer's patches.  Do unto others, and all that jazz.

The issues with the current trunk are now well documented on the list.
Use an earlier revision for now if it still causes you trouble;
otherwise, I still want to give him a chance to get this cleaned up.

I will try to help the community put policies into place that prevent
such severe problems from reaching the trunk in the future.  Thanks for
providing your feedback; sorry for all the noise and confusion.

Cheers,

Zach
