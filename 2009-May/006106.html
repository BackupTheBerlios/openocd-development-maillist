<PRE>I've gotten some information in email about BDM so I can
not claim credit for this analysis/research :-)


The PowerOPC BDM is not the same as the Coldfire BDM.
Some signals have the same name, but that is where the
similarities end.

The PowerPC relies of instructions serialized into the core
(DPIR register) and data moved in and out of the core (DRDR
register), while the Coldfire has specific operations (e.g. read
memory location.) The number of bits serialized into the device
is also different, 32 or 7 for the PowerPC (depending on the
command), 17 for the Coldfire (16 data and 1 status).
A useful feature of the Coldfire is that certain operations can
be executed while the core is running (they do cycle stealing
for operations such as read/write to memory locations) while
you have to stop the core to do this with the PowerPC (do not
quote me on this last part, but when I wrote the PowerPC library
for the Jumpercable I think I remember I had to stop the core for
everything.)

Also, some signals are quite different. The BDM has both
HRESET and SRESET, while the Coldfire has a BKPT that instantly
stops the core when asserted and can place the core in debug
immediately after reset.

Right next to me I have a Netburner SB70 board, and I am
waiting to find the time to work on a Jumpercable library for the
the BDM interface, but it is a lower priority for now. The market
for Coldfires is not that big (nothing that Freescale touches is
big anymore...:( and it is mostly owned by 3rd party tools.
