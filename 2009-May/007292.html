Nice catch.  This was a single bug, not actually two bugs.


However this is not the only solution.  This solution breaks the 
contract that the API would like to honor by ignoring the endstate 
parameter for the cases where the end state is DRSHIFT or IRSHIFT.   If 
there is another way to solve the problem that does not do this, then 
would it not be superior?


Before offering a solution, I mention that the problem is because the 
ft2232 moves the shifted in bits on the reply to a &quot;partial byte 
command&quot; based on the number of clocks.  This is the problem.  So you 
have know the number of clocks to get to the partial byte within the 
full byte reply.


Another solution is to record the number of clocks sent out and then use 
that number later in finding the partial byte.  This can be done by 
recording that number in the command object itself, say in a spare field 
reserved for the driver.


Then later in scan_read() this can be consulted and the partial byte can 
be found in the buffer within the full byte.

This lets you preserve the contract that the API would like to commit 
to, but is currently not committing to.  And it is simple.


Dick
