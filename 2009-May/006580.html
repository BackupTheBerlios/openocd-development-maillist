<PRE>In regards to how Zylin is approaching this market:

We *do* sell the ZY1000, but our core business is consulting.

This is reflected in the ZY1000 pricing and how we support it. It is
more expensive than your average dongle, which can even
be onboard a devkit making it effectively cost a couple of $'s.

What we are looking for is to have the ZY1000 work out of
the box without tinkering with OpenOCD releases, etc. We build and
provide firmwares for our unit. The ZY1000 runs OpenOCD and is
accessed via TCP/IP, which reduces driver hazzle and is along the
lines a lot of developers are accustomed to work.

If customers have problems, they can contact us and we help
them directly instead of them having to try their luck elsewhere.

This means that we want a plethora of working and tested
target scripts and that we are concerned about performance
and quality.

We would love to see more target support that we can comfortably
recommend to our customers. ARM11 is coming up and hopefully
Cortex-A8 eventually.

Our effort into OpenOCD is disproportional to how much we have
made back on the ZY1000 directly, but we enjoy open source
work and participating in the community.

If someone out there thinks that Zylin makes a great
contribution and we would be happy if you bought a ZY1000,
but *EVEN MORE HAPPY* :-) if you bring us consulting work
or talk about us to your clients and colleagues.

Click on the link at the bottom of the email to read more or write
me an email directly. We offer pretty much a full range
of embedded hardware, software and FPGA consulting work.
