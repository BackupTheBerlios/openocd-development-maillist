You have been on the list for some time, you should have known the
preferred rules of submitting patches. Disregarding them and then
stating &quot;take it or leave it&quot; is no way to cooperate on a project.

&gt;<i> BTW, the reason this patch was submitted as one is that it cannot be 
</I>&gt;<i> separated.  The system won't work with the reduced tms_seq clocks.  When 
</I>&gt;<i> does trust enter into this?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I do not think your approach is the right way to gain trust.
