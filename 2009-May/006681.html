<PRE>duane&gt; [about stuff in tcl/memory.tcl]

david&gt;  Hmm, I asked about this sort of thing not long ago:

I've been buried with other tasks and not paying attention much on the 
list for a while.. Other things had to take priorities.

david&gt; Everyone seems to be using mw{b,h,w} instead of memwrite{8,16,32}

Yea, the problem comes down to this:
       There are the &quot;old command context&quot; based commands
       ie: The original way Dominic et al wrote OpenOCD - which are PRE 
JimTCL.

And there are the new &quot;tcl&quot; based commands.
    Which was introduced mid last year
    Not everything has been transitioned.

The MW{BHW} should really be *removed* - in fact all &quot;command context&quot; 
commands should be deprecated and removed/replaced. 

The problem is &quot;hurding cats&quot; every cat has their own solution, and 
every cat thinks *some*other* part (ie: their part) of OpenOCD is more 
important to work on, people get mad... upset, and angry :-(

&gt;<i> There are also various arm-specific utilities, some to work with
</I>&gt;<i> physical addressese (vs, I guess, &quot;whatever the current MMU context
</I>&gt;<i> or non-context delivers&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Yes, and those commands effect the *current* target (as defined by a 
global variable in OpenOCD) nobody has really had multiple targets yet 
that I am aware of, I'm sure there that when somebody has a *REAL* dual 
core target system things will become very very interesting and lots of 
bugs will come out.

When I created the &quot;target-as-an-object&quot; command system last year, ie: 
the &quot;omap.cpu&quot; command creation, I specifically addressed that - so that 
one *COULD* in theory read/write specific targets.

What is *REALLY* missing in terms of documentation is &quot;road map&quot; 
material - intent of certain things, methods, etc. So that people see a 
vision of how things can come together to solve a problem.

ie: Why does the the HTTP server exist and the TCL server exist? It's 
not what people think. The intent is/was a universal GUI front end, and 
the ability to script OpenOCD in a far more universal way then anything 
one might do with a &quot;libopenocd&quot; solution and is *DIRECTLY* related to 
the &quot;chip.tcl&quot; stuff.

BTW - I wrote all of that TCL stuff nearly 9 months ago.

david&gt; Hmm, I noticed that chip/atmel/at91/at91sam7x128.tcl (for example)
david&gt;defines a global AT91C_ID ... which strongly presumes that there's
david&gt; only one at91 family chip, since those IDs vary between chips.

In general, atmel has a single set of IP that defines a peripherals, and 
they re-use it over and over again across all of the AT91 series parts, 
sort of like a &quot;we have a uart in our chip library&quot;. Other chip 
companies do the same thing. All atmel uarts have the same flavor - they 
have one uart design - and it has evolved over the years.

david&gt; What I had started to do with some DaVinci stuff is define a
david&gt; dictionary with various chip-specific symbols, then have the
david&gt; utilities use the relevant dictionary.

Good idea! The real trick is to understand how the family goes together.

You also might look a the other top level things in the top level directory.

-Duane.
