</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> not include the _t.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I hate it.  You seriously want to make all of the functions that

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> was
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> _exactly_ what I meant when I said a patch would be hard to create.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It wasn't hard to create at all.  Eight find and replaces is all it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> took.  Less than 10 minutes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It was incomplete and would probably raise objections from others.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
How was it incomplete?  It still compiled and I saw no obvious  
errors.  The only contentious portion is the changing of a the  
function names that included uX.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Also, you do realize that the scope of these changes is _much_ more
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> likely to be disruptive to anyone with out-of-tree changes in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> progress?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yup.  It is.  Sadly until we decide on all these various conventions,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> things are always going to be disruptive to those with out-of-tree
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changes.  At least in this case, syncing with ToT is relatively
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simple.  Using minimal change as an argument for is dangerous.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Consider the local minimum effect.  To get to a better solution, you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might need to stir things up a bit in the short term.  The question  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need to be asking is &quot;Do we do a big change now, or do we live with a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> non-standard type system?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are talking about 0.2.0.  Would you like to perform the risk/reward
</I>&gt;<i> analysis of my patch versus yours, focusing on the impact they will  
</I>&gt;<i> each
</I>&gt;<i> have on fixes being developed for the release?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
As we already know, the bulk of the work for 0.2.0 is in the tree  
already.  In terms of risk/reward, both patches provide low reward for  
low-medium risk.  I wouldn't really consider either for 0.2.0 just  
because they don't really impact the users at all.  It's just a  
consistency cleanup in the code.

&gt;<i> A local minimum would be better than no change and much better than  
</I>&gt;<i> your
</I>&gt;<i> proposed big change.  It would better to have and stick to a  
</I>&gt;<i> convention
</I>&gt;<i> that we can change later, minimizing the cost to everyone today.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Any change increases the cost to anyone developing patches out of  
tree.  In the grand scheme of things, neither patch is necessary today  
and neither really reduces the impact on outstanding patches.  In  
either case, some set of patch authors will need to do some work to  
update.

&gt;<i> I cleaned up the code to the current convention because it is the  
</I>&gt;<i> right
</I>&gt;<i> thing to do _today_.  Period.  Tomorrow is a different story, and you
</I>&gt;<i> should definitely be aware that I am open to a patch like yours  
</I>&gt;<i> someday.
</I>&gt;<i> Just not for 0.2.0, okay?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm much more a fan of &quot;think first, then do&quot;.  In this case, rushing  
to enforce consistency doesn't magically make the situation better.   
For 0.2.0, neither patch should be accepted since neither introduces  
any bug fix or user visible benefit.  As for tomorrow, we should  
actually figure out what we want to do and then make a patch to do it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The two sides have chimed in, patches have been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provided, and a fair number of developers have commented.  It's up to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the majority to decide which way to go.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Okay, I waited to pull the consensus card, but the majority of others
</I>&gt;<i> have already expressed their opinion that the shorthand status quo  
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i> be acceptable (if not preferred).  I think even Duane is okay with it.
</I>&gt;<i> While you thus represent the minority, I have entertained this  
</I>&gt;<i> argument
</I>&gt;<i> because your earlier point was essentially correct: both of our  
</I>&gt;<i> proposed
</I>&gt;<i> standards are perfectly valid conventions in their own right.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yup and having a discussion on the merits of each is good and healthy.

&gt;<i> If anything, my frustration derives from the fact that -- as a
</I>&gt;<i> maintainer yourself -- you should have been looking at the consensus
</I>&gt;<i> that was already being expressed by the community and let it drop  
</I>&gt;<i> sooner
</I>&gt;<i> than this (nevermind 0.2.0 considerations).  As a project leader, I  
</I>&gt;<i> see
</I>&gt;<i> these kinds of debates as detrimental to being effective in a  
</I>&gt;<i> community,
</I>&gt;<i> as it appears the individuals are unable resolve their points in an
</I>&gt;<i> efficient and effective manner.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
There is _no_ harm is having a discussion on alternatives.  It doesn't  
make us any less efficient or effective.  It _does_ allow for both  
side to show their cards and for the points to be clarified. I didn't  
feel to need to &quot;just drop it&quot; because the arguments presented for the  
short types were based on preference alone.  So far we've had a few  
early opinions followed by a few long opinions.  Only you and I seem  
to really be debating anything.  The majority in this case spoke early  
and haven't really participated in any discussion.  There isn't a  
consensus (implies everyone agrees) nor does there need to be one at  
this stage.  Not every issue can be resolved solely on technical  
merits and settled in a quick survey.

&gt;<i> This is why I have come to prefer &quot;benevolent dictators&quot; in open  
</I>&gt;<i> source.
</I>&gt;<i> Right and wrong are too frequently subjective subjects, and it would
</I>&gt;<i> just be better for someone must step in end the argument with a
</I>&gt;<i> decision.  Successive &quot;wrong&quot; decisions are met with forks, but those
</I>&gt;<i> that think them &quot;right&quot; will all be moving in harmony towards their  
</I>&gt;<i> next
</I>&gt;<i> project milestone.  I think this project could use more of that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Benevolent dictators certainly keep things moving along, but they also  
kill off lots of potentially great ideas along the way.  This is an  
open-source project.  We don't have any real deadlines. We don't have  
management telling us what to do.  We don't have marketing telling us  
when we must release or what features we need.  Open discussion of  
issues big and small is good and healthy.  Given enough time, most of  
the issues will ultimately settled by some form of compromise.  The  
benevolent dictator model just circumvents a consensus by declaring it  
so.  That isn't necessarily bad but isn't necessarily good either.  Do  
you really think Linus is able to pick the best option 100% of the  
time?  You might be surprised at how these types of discussions  
frequently result in even better results than the original &quot;sides&quot;  
that were offered.

&gt;<i> Please correct me if I am wrong on these points.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
For some things, there is no right or wrong.  This is one of them.

&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Zach

&quot;He said he hadn't had a byte in three days. I had a short, so I split  
it with him.&quot;
