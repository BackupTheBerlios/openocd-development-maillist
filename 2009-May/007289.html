Nonsense.  


cmd_queue_cur_state is a record of &quot;the future effect of the most 
recently queued command&quot;, i.e. what was last put into the queue.  The 
queue can be thought of as a pipe with a delay, and the contents of the 
queue should eventually find its way to the driver then to the tap 
controllers.  Anything in the queue cannot be undone, but is not in 
effect yet.   Image a piece of PVC pipe and you put billiard balls into 
it of different colors.  There is a delay, and then the balls come out 
in the same sequence some time later.

Two observers, one at the entrance to the pipe and one at the tail of 
the pipe will see the same balls, but not at the same time.  The balls 
are analogous to the commands.
tap_set_state() is a &quot;reporting mechanism&quot; by the last observer.  The 
driver is reporting what it did to the taps and what state the driver 
believes the actual hardware taps to be in because of actions that the 
driver took in response to commands coming in via the queue.   Only the 
driver executes commands and therefore it is the only code which knows 
what it did, and how this effects the actual taps.  Therefore they 
should be the only ones to call tap_set_state().

If you allow anybody but a driver to call tap_set_state() you have 
perverted the purpose of tap_set_state() and you have brought on 
insanity, so checking for it, as you state, is not needed, because it is 
sure to be present.


You can create an accessor/variable pair for the front of the queue, but 
it must be separate from the cable helper api.


I would suggest

    jtag_set_future_state(),
    jtag_record_future_state(), or
    jtag_set_requested_state()

as possible function names for this encapsulation of the global variable 
that you would like to hide.



jtag_set_requested_state( aState )
{
    cmd_queue_cur_state = aState
}


jtag_get_requested_state()
{
    return cmd_queue_cur_state;
}


All suggestions use a prefix different from the tap_ prefix which seems 
to be common among functions in the cable helper api.  Seems to be, 
because that is how I wrote them.


Do not confuse what you are seeing at the entrance to the pipe and the 
expected consequences of commands issued there at the jtag level, with 
what is actually in the tap controllers beyond the end of the pipe and 
accomplished by the drivers.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We can add a &quot; jtag_add_forced_set_state&quot; or someting similar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or we can do a jtag_execute_queue to flush the command queue and then 
</I>&gt;<i> a tap_set_state().
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> These two concepts are separate, and cannot be merged because of the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> queue.   tap_set_state() is for current state of the taps.   But 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> realize there is can be some delay here also because sometimes their 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are low level commands buffered before being sent out on USB.  So 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tap_set_state() only tracks to the best of its ability the current 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> state.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
