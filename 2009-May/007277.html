</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A MIPS question for those who know. Is there a usefull debug module in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the NEC V850? I would think that it would have at least the standard
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MIPS module.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Am I wrong to think that? According to NEC and IAR the only way to debug
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is to use the minicube.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do not know much about V850. Are you suggesting that V850
</I>&gt;<i> and MIPS core have some relations? Google does not suggest
</I>&gt;<i> this...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>

It might not be or is derived from one. I asked the question because I
was told at one time by a salesman that it was a MIPS

That line might give the implication that it is some sort of mips device.

/usr/lib/gcc-lib/mips-linux-gnu/2.95.4/include/va-v850.h

But from this site it appears to be an NEC design

Their JTAG interface is called N-WIRE

Their devices are about the best I have seen as far as embedded devices
are. Look at the V850ES though for the current ones.


For interrupt access
An ARM7TDMI takes 24 cycles to get to an interrupt
A Cortex-M3 takes 12 cycles to get to an interrupt
A V850E takes 4 cycles to get to an interrupt

As far as speed, at 32Mhz V850E is close to twice the speed of a
Micronas ARM7TDMI at 48Mhz.

I had never thought about looking at these devices until we were forced
to do so by Micronas screwing us by discontinuing their ARM7TDMI flash
devices.
I am very impressed by their Dashboard (Cluster) and Body devices (2 to
6 CAN available and price is very good)

The NEC programmer is only $100 but it is serial. The debugging is
N-WIRE (JTAG) and requires a device for debugging ($250-$500). I was
wondering if anyone
is familiar with these processors internals to know if the internal
debugging module has enough so we could do some debugging without
needing the outside device.

Some devices can be bought at relatively low price for personal designs,
so it is not just for us in the automotive industry.

They are well known for having good prices for small 8 bit devices
