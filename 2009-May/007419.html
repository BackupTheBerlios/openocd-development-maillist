<PRE>Duane Ellis a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> **THIS*IS*OFF*LIST**
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The context switching in the NEC devices has no match. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Really, I'd like to see how you do this, in a pre-empt context switch 
</I>&gt;<i> there are lots of registers to save, do you have a *specific* NEC 
</I>&gt;<i> support group you work with? I'd like a name or two, local guys here 
</I>&gt;<i> are clue-less. Factory guy came in 5 months ago, gave us a training 
</I>&gt;<i> session about PM Plus not able to answer questions I had.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>This is not something a salesman is telling me but actual data from NEC 
where they compare the AR7TDMI, Cortex-M3 and V850ES
According to their chart, an interrupt takes 24 cycles for ARM7TDMI, 12 
for Cortex-M3 and 4 for their new V850ES.

I would assume that it has to be hardware contex switching. I would 
agree that many salesman are full of something, Freescale and Infineon
to lead the pack in that. The funny part was with Freescale who told me 
that ST would not be allowed to sell us PowerPC parts for 3 years. ST 
was furious.
Freescale being pissed that I would not consider their 16 bit part to 
replace an ARM device tried to go over my head.

NEC loan me some boards and software, I will make my own evaluation.  I 
accepted the Infineon board for courtesy but it doesn't look to me like 
it can drive my stepper motors.

The device to replace is basically a cluster device, not too many on the 
market. There is TI, Samsung, NEC, Freescale, Fujitsu., two of them 
being 16 bits.
I can connect 6 steppers directly on the NEC, TI or Samsung devices, 
four with Fujitsu.

&gt;<i> FYI - I'm an os-type person, very familiar with *other* CPUs, wrote a 
</I>&gt;<i> few kernels, etc, but I am very new to the V850ES parts, and support I 
</I>&gt;<i> see from NEC here is best described as a simple sales man. Writing a 
</I>&gt;<i> simple task switcher from a data sheet - is sort of difficult.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Find me a 32 bits processor that takes 4 cycles to get to an interrupt. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But then you have a lot to save right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>This would imply hardware switching like on the V25. As I said earlier I 
will be able to differentiate between sales crap and reality as I play 
with it.
What gives me the impression that he might be correct is my past 
experience with the V25 where the switching was very quick. Each 
interrupt had
its own set of registers.
I did a light control system for the Montr&#233;al Casino with a V25 and I 
used the hardware interrupt switching. That was something considering 
that with the regular
interrupt structure there are tons of registers to push on the stack. 
With NEC interrupt on the V25 I didn't need to push anything on the stack.
I don't remember the number of cycles but that was quite a difference 
with the standard 80188 hardware.

In the kind of system I work on interrupts are as short as possible. I 
don't do OS type stuff, I have my own small kernel with its tasks scheduler.

On a project I did recently I had to bit bang 35 LEDs at different duty 
cycles for dimming. I used a Cortex-M3 from ST. That thing is impressive 
but so far
ST doesn't have anything that would suit our requirement so far.
&gt;<i> *****
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also what tools do you use? The NEC PM+, IAR, or GreenHills, or 
</I>&gt;<i> something else? I have a NEC ICE-CUBE, and a few eval boards.. but 
</I>&gt;<i> without *real* technical people answering questions I find it hard if 
</I>&gt;<i> not impossible to get information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Either NEC or IAR, depending on how much my boss wants to spend. We do 
have a few good NEC technical people in Michigan. They have been very 
helpfull so far.
I used Greenhills for a few weeks and hated it. Never got any real help 
from them. IAR are very helpfull.

Micronas was a pain, one thing that was amusing was when I asked why a 
certain pin had to be pulled to ground. They refused to give the reason 
saying that it must
be pulled to ground. Debugging thru JTAG was marginal at best in the 
devices we were using following their advice. One day I had a board that 
accidentally erased itself. I got my answer but Micronas should have 
been honest. The morons have a Spansion flash internally, they chose the 
biggest Flash to be at the boot. This is ridiculous since my CAN 
bootloader is about 8k.

Cypress was pushing some new devices and the salesman had a funny look 
when I asked if the new devices had the self erase feature. Under 
certain conditions their
flash would self erase. This can be problematic in a vehicle when a 
gauge has its flash erased. They fixed that bug, the reminder didn't 
make him too happy.
