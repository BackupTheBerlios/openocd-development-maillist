Or rather, every time the set of goals is established, it gets thrown  
out the window a week later.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yup.  A todo list is great, but we need a more rigid definition of  
what need to be done to make the next release.  Essentially, we need  
to decide on &quot;features&quot; for a release.  Any large changes need to be  
aligned with a feature.  Small fixes should be accepted even if they  
don't align with a feature.

&gt;<i> Right *now*, what criteria are being used to choose
</I>&gt;<i> whether to merge a patch, reject it, or hold it back
</I>&gt;<i> until the next release?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Right now, the options are merge or let it die.  For nearly everything  
that hits the list, it is automatically committed to SVN with little  
review or commentary.  I'm not a fan of this.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Example:  there was a patch a while back (from Dick
</I>&gt;<i> Hollenbeck) that included about 60K of ft2232 and
</I>&gt;<i> TMS sequencing updates ... and gratuitous changes
</I>&gt;<i> to whitespace, and surely other things.  I don't
</I>&gt;<i> know of many projects which wouldn't also reject
</I>&gt;<i> such patches with &quot;please split into smaller patches
</I>&gt;<i> so this can be reviewed&quot;, as happened.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If that *had* been split and resubmitted ... there
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be no process in place to say which changes
</I>&gt;<i> are safe to merge *now* versus which can't merge
</I>&gt;<i> because they'd destabilize release plans, versus
</I>&gt;<i> which are worth merging even if they *do* destabilize
</I>&gt;<i> things (because e.g. fixing TMS bugs is critical).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If it _had_ been split and resubmitted, I'd have voted to take the  
FT2232 fixes and the TMS sequencing updates.  Both had been discussed  
for quite a while.  They were implemented in an opt-in model.  It was  
safe to take into trunk with no real impact unless you opted-in.

Of course, I'd love a more formal process in which we decide on the  
feature set for the next release and only accept things into it that  
implement those features.  Of course, we should also allow overlap of  
releases (branch the release from trunk a while before the release is  
finished) and also allow radical development to occur on branches  
where they could be merged into trunk after the release is branched.   
See any large project for examples.

&quot;He said he hadn't had a byte in three days. I had a short, so I split  
it with him.&quot;
