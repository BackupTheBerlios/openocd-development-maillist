<PRE>Xiaofan Chen a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> 2009/5/25 Michel Catudal &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">michelcatudal at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Some devices can be bought at relatively low price for personal designs,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so it is not just for us in the automotive industry.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.futureelectronics.com/en/Search.aspx?dsNav=Ntk:PartNumberSearch|V850|1|,Ny:True,Nea:True">http://www.futureelectronics.com/en/Search.aspx?dsNav=Ntk:PartNumberSearch|V850|1|,Ny:True,Nea:True</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've seen a few designs with NEC V850 (Mini PLCs).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>NEC is very big in the US automotive industry and is a major player
here. They have foundries in many places around the world.
The funny part with most of our American company is that to same money
they have moved the production outside to low cost labor countries.
NEC has build big in the USA and move some production here. They have
won the hearts and minds of a lot of American Engineers.
&gt;&gt;<i> They are well known for having good prices for small 8 bit devices
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.futureelectronics.com/en/Technologies/Product.aspx?ProductID=UPD78F9202MACACANEC2877710">http://www.futureelectronics.com/en/Technologies/Product.aspx?ProductID=UPD78F9202MACACANEC2877710</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've the luxury to read some assembly codes of NEC17k 4-bit
</I>&gt;<i> OTP/Masks MCUs. NEC was suggesting us to go for their 78K
</I>&gt;<i> 8-bit. But in the end I replaced them with Microchip PIC16 in
</I>&gt;<i> a simple but important design (EEx explosion proof Automation
</I>&gt;<i> market: a transformer isolated barrier which is the bread and
</I>&gt;<i> butter for the company). That was back in 1999 in my previous job.
</I>&gt;<i> At that time, NEC documentation is quite bad. Their emulator was
</I>&gt;<i> very expensive. NEC chips seemed to be ok then. Luckily I
</I>&gt;<i> chose Microchip and not Atmel AT90S AVR since Atmel obsoleted
</I>&gt;<i> all the AT90S AVR over the years and the product needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> in the market for 10-15 years at 100k-200k per year.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>The nice thing with NEC is that they don't discontinue parts as do other
company. They still provide you with 4 bits or 8 bits
devices if you need them even when the parts no longer officially exist.
If you have a design with their devices they will provide
you with parts as long as you are willing to pay for them.

This is very important for us for military and automotive designs
because they doesn't want any change when a product works.

Companies bad for pulling parts of the market are Freescale and Hitachi
(now Renesas).

NEC and ST are two companies who have made serious profits last year
while companies like NXP, Infineon and Freescale have huge debts.
