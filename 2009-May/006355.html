Applied as r1693.  This appears like it should do the trick correctly,
so I hope it finally solves this problem.

Well-written crash reports should always be welcome against the current
trunk.  Be sure that you are using '--enable-maintainer-mode' and do a
'make clean' before testing with the latest versions, as it is
definitely possible to end up with a build that crashes that would have
worked fine after rebuilding from scratch.

&gt;<i> Should I use the latest SVN version and try again even if it's under
</I>&gt;<i> heavy development? If I go back to SVN version xxxx/Release 0.1 and try
</I>&gt;<i> again, will someone be interested if the report is for an older version?
</I>
Personally, I prefer feedback against the trunk, though I want to see
the project get on a regular release schedule.  Right now, I think we
are best off focusing our efforts on bringing stability back to the
trunk and, from there, heading directly into a testing/release cycle.

&gt;<i> Anyway - is it of any worth for the project/the maintainers if an
</I>&gt;<i> end-user like me keeps track with trunk for tests it and send feedback?
</I>
Yes! :)  Good feedback should always be welcome.  I will post another
thread that extends this idea quite a ways.

&gt;<i> I'd like to suggest that branches should be created for major
</I>&gt;<i> modifications that need some development-time and integrate them into
</I>&gt;<i> trunk once thinks have been settled and tested a little bit. Cortex-M3
</I>&gt;<i> support (and XScale too IRC) has been developed like this and I
</I>&gt;<i> personally found that this has been a good approach.
</I>
It looks like we will be headed down a more rigorous path, though the
details have yet to be determined.  I hope to see this process move
forward somewhat quickly, now that the issues have come to a head.
Still, we need to adopt policies that will be both efficient for
maintainers but will also be effective for the whole OpenOCD community.

It will take some time to put a plan together and reach consensus, but
you are welcome to contribute to making the process move forward.
I recently posted a thread with the subject &quot;openocd policies&quot;, and I
invite you (and all users) to post a list of suggestions in reply to it.

Cheers,

Zach
