AFAIK, we are not installing any headers.  I agree with your sentiments
completely; private headers should never be installed.  Moreover, I
added a test suite during this work to ensure that the public interfaces
are not polluted by private headers (now or in the future).  If changes
to those files add a private header, it should break the test suite.

It also is a developer convenience; the files are all in the same
directory available for browsing and editing.  The new tree would split
up the source code, making it more impossible to do `vim jtag.[ch]`.
The changes you request are technically superfluous, and they would
create more patches than required by moving files needlessly.  The
thrust of my proposal was to cure the paths for the headers themselves,
and to avoid reorganizing the tree any more than absolutely required.

Where the files live in the source tree has little to no impact on where
they live once installed in the filesystem.  To know where they will end
up (and thus which are public), developers should look at Makefile.am or
(after this work is done) the doxygen manual.  Location in the tree is
not a reliable indicator of such.

To make this discussion slightly more concrete, I have attached the
patches that I had started to create before posting my original plan.
While these changes build fine (for me), they are far from being ready
to be committed (for _many_ different reasons); however, I think they
will provide a concrete demonstration of my attempt to minimize change.

Cheers,

Zach
