<PRE>Sorry to interrupt (; I thought that I'd share my &quot;outsider's opinion&quot; 
with all.

Just a while ago someone (Zach?) was talking about a need for a stable 
&quot;production cycle&quot; with frequent release branches. A 0.2.0 release was 
mentioned to happen after the recent perforance issues would got fixed 
(in fact 0.2.0 was mentioned ~3 times since 0.1.0). The performance is 
back (I've checked and it's even a tiny bit faster than 0.1.0 release on 
STM32), and the &quot;need for 0.2.0&quot; is gone - there are at least 100 new 
ideas instead.

For an average user - like myself - it is very good to know that &quot;this 
version is fine, use it with no fear&quot;, but the SVN in the recent weeks 
is bathed in chaos (; There is always something going on, so picking up 
a right version is pretty much a lottery. Let's say that I have a 
comfortable situation, because I know how to compile the package, but - 
believe me - there are hundreds of &quot;domestic ARM developers&quot; who know 
nothing about MinGW, MSYS, autotools and stuff - configuring Eclipse to 
handle ARM gcc is pretty much a great achievement for them (I know, 'coz 
I've been there just a while ago). Actually there is NO good description 
of how to compile OpenOCD for Windows, so it's quite exclusive knowledge.

Since 0.1.0 many things have changed - I know about full RLink support 
and Cortex-A8 handling, but probably many more minor and major stuff had 
been fixed, introduced or tweaked... Sorry if I've missed something very 
important...

Any chance for a release branch - say - once every 2 months (0.1.0 was 
put up around the end of January)?

BTW 1 - the SVN revision guessing stuff really doesn't work for me...
BTW 2 - now the compilation process gives TWO openocd.exe files and the 
more obvious one (src/openocd.exe) is the wrong one... The right one is 
placed in src/.libs/openocd.exe (or sth) - that's pretty confusing.

And to make my mail a bit more positive - OpenOCD is moving (running?) 
in a good direction! It's very good that it's moving (running?) forward 
with great power.

Regards!

</PRE>
