Allright! I need to write a driver somewhere in the next couple of weeks/months (when the JTAG programmer hardware arrives). Perhaps I can sketch/write some outlines on putting a driver together. I just don't know how this would work with the current version of OpenOCD. A lot seems to be happening lately (which is good!) but I'm not sure the current driver model is still the same as version 0.1.0.
