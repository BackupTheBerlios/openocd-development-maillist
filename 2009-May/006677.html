Documentation?  Didn't even know that tcl/* stuff existed.  :)

There aren't even any users of the tcl/* stuff in any of
the existing cfg files.  And as we know, examples are all
too often substitutes for documentation.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That file has a number of functions like: &#160; &quot;memread32 &#160;ADDRESS&quot;
</I>
Hmm, I asked about this sort of thing not long ago:

  <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2009-May/006340.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2009-May/006340.html</A>

Nobody knew about &quot;memread32&quot; as an answer...

 
&gt;<i> By design, it handles various errors.
</I>
Everyone seems to be using mw{b,h,w} instead of memwrite{8,16,32}
and I was the first to seem to notice that the md{b,h,w} siblings
were useless for scripting purposes.

There are also various arm-specific utilities, some to work with
physical addressese (vs, I guess, &quot;whatever the current MMU context
or non-context delivers&quot;).

These seem like the sorts of things that ought to be builtins,
not library layers...


&gt;<i> You might also take a look around find the files: &#160;&quot;stm32_regs.tcl&quot; - 
</I>&gt;<i> and some sam7 versions.
</I> 
Hmm, I noticed that chip/atmel/at91/at91sam7x128.tcl (for example)
defines a global AT91C_ID ... which strongly presumes that there's
only one at91 family chip, since those IDs vary between chips.

What I had started to do with some DaVinci stuff is define a
dictionary with various chip-specific symbols, then have the
utlities use the relevant dictionary.

Now, I *like* the idea of having a way to grow libraries of
reusable Jim code to help work with chips, and symbolic names
for registers (or at least controllers) seems essential to that.
But I'm not sure that's quite the right way to start.
