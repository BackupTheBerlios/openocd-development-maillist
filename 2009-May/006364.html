<PRE>Hi all,

I have finished committing my outstanding patches that eliminate the
redundancies in OpenOCD header file #include directives, which resulted
in the elimination of about 1000 lines of code and helped decouple
various parts of the system.  Work remains to be done on this later.

Let me know if I managed to break the build; however, I tried to be
careful to ensure that each incremental patch resulted in a working tree
and that little was actually removed.  I found that even more header
files may be removed from system.h, but I was not certain that those
changes would be portable.  We can experiment at a later time.

Assuming these changes were safe, I will continue on my quest to
identify and eliminate layering violations in the system.  I have
already marked the few that exist in the helper module, so I hope
someone will take the initiative to fix those issues to remove these
unnecessary couplings.  I fear that these will be the easy ones....

Cheers,

Zach
