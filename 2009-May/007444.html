<PRE>duane&gt; [I want a board test feature]

 &gt; How does those higher end tester like Agilent 3070 in circuit tester 
work?
 &gt; Do they require extra add-on for JTAG related stuff like Boundary Scan?
 &gt; Do they use BDSL files? I know they can flash some MCUs but not all.
 &gt; Last time we have to use off-line programming for TMS470R1A64/A256
 &gt; since the support was not ready yet.

I think - while those systems *COULD* do flash programing - the truth is 
something else. The *COST* - in machine time, makes it too expensive.

To be clear: I think big systems like the Agilent have their place, they 
do all kinds of other stuff. However, I believe they all require an 
expensive &quot;bed of nails&quot; fixture, lots of time and money for a 10 board 
prototype run, or fixing a few very expensive test boards

I'm talking about basic continuity and pin drive, and ability to read a 
digital value on a pin, this type of problem:

    I built 10 prototype boards - and 4 do not work. What's wrong? I 
don't have an XRAY machine.
    These are prototypes, I don't have budget to create bed-of-nails 
fixture, What are my options?
   
If I had a program that could take the Schematic netlist + the BSDL 
files for a couple complex chips - and give me a SVF file or something 
like that - to verify basic connectivity on the board - wow!
For those pins attached to a memory device - a simple memory test would 
be powerful.
If I could get OpenOCD to 'wiggle' a pin - that would be great.

Imagine
    (1) being able to plug OpenOCD/JTAG into the board.
    (2) using some gerber view program - view the PCB
    (3) Double click on a pin, or a trace with a mouse
    (4) The trace starts blinking
    (5) And openocd makes the trace toggle 0/1

That alone would be a powerful debug tool, no debug software to write, 
no flash to program, no nothing.

-Duane.
