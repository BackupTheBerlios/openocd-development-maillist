The last list I saw.  Might be time to re-post it.
A &quot;libocd&quot; would be one bullet on such a list.


&gt;<i> &gt; Right *now*, what criteria are being used to choose
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whether to merge a patch, reject it, or hold it back
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; until the next release?
</I>
That seems like a big un-answerable question ...
and thus a significant problem.

  
&gt;<i> &gt; Example:  there was a patch a while back (from Dick
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hollenbeck) that included about 60K of ft2232 and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; TMS sequencing updates ... and gratuitous changes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to whitespace, and surely other things.  I don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; know of many projects which wouldn't also reject
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; such patches with &quot;please split into smaller patches
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so this can be reviewed&quot;, as happened.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> Well,  since it is more than five days old I suppose it is dead fish.
</I>
Unfortunate but true.


&gt;<i> But I can tell you that all the state transition stuff works well, both 
</I>&gt;<i> in 7 state version and and shortest path.
</I>&gt;<i> There are some issues about PAUSE -&gt; SCAN paths does not go through  
</I>&gt;<i> CAPTURE, but this path is never used in the present code.
</I>
What I recall was addition of some logging to help ensure
the drivers go through the same state transitions.  That
seems like an area where regression-testing would be good;
not just useful for debugging.


&gt;<i> I do not know about  high speed  ft2232h and ft4232h since I havnt got 
</I>&gt;<i> any such hardware.
</I>
I think Amontec should send several of us some free
HS jtag keys to help out.  What do you think?  :)


&gt;<i> Reconnect looks ok but not tested.
</I>
