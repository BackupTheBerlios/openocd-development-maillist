I agree.  Of course, it is also possible to do the autodetection in C,  
but it would still require a pretty significant infrastructure  
change.  Either way, this would be a long term project that should be  
done as a branch or as a new project.  I suspect it would be better to  
do as a branch as it isn't _really_ a new project and much of the code  
for targets and interfaces would reused.  At this stage though, any  
discussions would be merely about the proposal and what we want to do  
longer term.  It should in no way impact the progress on current  
releases or projects.
