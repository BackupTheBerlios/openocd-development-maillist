Since no one has objected to my recently proposed style guide changes, I
might take a shot at adding a section for this to my patch. 

Personally, I prefer (and have been using) '@' as well, partly because I
think that character stands out visually better than '\' does.  I also
prefer a block-like style:

/**
 * start commenting here
 */

But for one-line comments (of which this patch has a few), I prefer
standard /** comment */; however, use /**&lt; */ style comments after
fields to minimize the number of added lines (if &lt;80 columns total).

Finally, be sure to read through your comments again.  I see at least
one sentence that seems to

Cheers,

Zach
