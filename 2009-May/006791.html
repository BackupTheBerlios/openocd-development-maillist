<PRE>Hi all,

I have prepared the following e-mails to attempt to move the OpenOCD
release process into motion, breaking out some various policies for
managing our ongoing releases and milestones that should also give us
some degree of quality-assurance.  These cover several related (but
separable) topics, and I decided it would be best to split them up to
put each one on its own thread for easier tracking and reference.

The first thread covers the demand for 0.2.0 release &quot;features&quot;, and
closing out our current progress.

For some perspective on what we _need_ therein, I will post my proposed
release &quot;tactics&quot; and &quot;strategy&quot; in two other threads.  That way, we can
separate the discussions about release and milestone processes from each
other, respectively.  These should raise talk about both the segments
and complete arc of development between 0.2.0, 0.3.0, and beyond.

The fourth thread relates to a prototype for smoke-test reporting tools,
which outlines my in-progress code derived from my earlier proposal. [1]
Its goal should keep us from deserving retrogressive version schemes,
but the code is not quite ready to share (give me a day or two).  Today,
this aims to provide additional perspective to supplement the preceding
proposals and allow for some pre-commit feedback.

While I have spent time separating the issues and providing perspective,
they remain somewhat like drafts.  I hope they are well-received, but
they are meant primarily as my proposals for moving things forward in
these areas constructively.  Following the community's reaction, I will
convert the basic text and any feedback to add guidelines to the doxygen
developer guide.

Cheers,
