<PRE>Hi all,

Since this weekend, I have spent some time working on a set of Perl
scripts to prototype the back-end system that will aggregate the data
and present it for review (pre-analysis).  

I started on this to replace the static developer table that I was using
to augment The List.  I think most of what I am doing will need to be
rewritten in SQL to scale up, but I wanted the first draft to avoid any
serious external dependencies (e.g. a SQL engine).

These scripts work on plain text table files: one line per row, '\t'
delimits the columns.   The 'tool.pl' script can be used to manipulate
the data from the shell (or other non-Perl scripts), and the 'html.pl'
script can convert the data into cross-linked static HTML pages.  Both
use the included 'Tables.pm', which I whipped together this weekend for
this purpose.  

The tables track reports from users detailing the results from running
the regression test suite.  A &quot;report&quot; will specify the &quot;platform&quot;,
&quot;interface&quot;, and &quot;target&quot; or &quot;board&quot; that was tested by the &quot;user&quot;,
along with the 'version' of OpenOCD, the test 'results', along with a
'comment'.  In this description, words in double-quotes ('&quot;')
effectively describe various primary tables, while the words in
single-quotes (&quot;'&quot;) describe column fields.

Similarly, each user may specify a list of devices that they can use for
testing, so specific users may be prompted for testing particular
configurations.  This last feature also allows me to create a developer
roster that improves on the one that I had been tracking in The List
(until r1828).

Presently, this user-tracking half is (all but) complete, since that was
the reason I started this work.  The reporting then builds on it; users
with one platform, interface and target should not be made to specify
these parameters repeatedly when they will be contributing a single
time-series of data points.

Known problems:
- I have tried to KISS, so there are going to be definite limits.
- Additional database design work needs to be done.
- Static output only.
- Missing an 'email.pl' script to provide a gateway from e-mail messages
sent by the automated tester.
- Automated tester does not report PASS/FAIL and send e-mails.

I will try to post my initial implementation in the next day or two, but
I am curious what others think of this approach.

Cheers,

Zach Welch
