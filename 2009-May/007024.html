New drivers should be welcome.  I think &quot;new features&quot; here implies
works that would affect all targets/boards/etc.  No core changes.

I have been taking lack of objections as tacit approval, with the caveat
that this interpretation might be wrong. :)

&gt;<i> Worth IMO drawing a distinction between &quot;core&quot; support
</I>&gt;<i> and the rest.  One thing that Linux does is recognize
</I>&gt;<i> that new drivers can't cause regressions ... so that
</I>&gt;<i> they can safely be added later in the release cycle.
</I>&gt;<i> While a very strict policy would say &quot;new driver&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> a kind of &quot;new feature&quot;, it can also be viewed as a
</I>&gt;<i> flavor of bugfix -- &lt;hardware X&gt; didn't work before.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I'd agree it's certainly time to work on stability
</I>&gt;<i> for the core, no new features/functionality.  But that
</I>&gt;<i> should leave the door open to other bits, IMO.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Especially since work on those other bits has been
</I>&gt;<i> stalled, off and on, by core stability issues.  ;)

I think we're on the same page.

Cheers,

Zach
