Discipline.  That is the operative word.  We need more of it all around.
Policies and processes simply seek to culture that singular attribute.

That would be the &quot;packager&quot; role.  Yes, their input will be valued too.
I think those individuals should be giving input to the release manager,
who uses their feedback to gage when to move from RC to final release.
Obviously, their input should be considered at every stage, but we are
talking specifically about the release process in this thread.

FWIW, I believe the Debian/Ubuntu 0.0 version series has been created
from the SVN repository exclusively.  It's nice to be needed that bad,
but it does not reflect well on the project.

Cheers,

Zach
