If my theory about external state not getting fully reset
is correct, valgrind wouldn't show anything relevant...


&gt;<i> I notice the &quot;icepick&quot;. Is that one of the JTAG routing devices?
</I>
Yes, that's TI's name for those modules(*) ... I hear
there's some IEEE standard in this area, but don't know
if that standard matches what ICEpick implements.


&gt;<i> Could it be enabling/disabling devices in the chain?
</I>
No; it doesn't work like OMAP3.  On the DaVinci chips,
if the EMU0/EMU1 signals are grounded they come up in
a &quot;debug scan chain&quot; where you don't need to poke the
ICEpick to make it include the ARM core.  I've jumpered
those low, to avoid needing poke-the-ICEpick logic.

If the EMU0/EMU1 signals were pulled high, it comes up
like the OMAP3 on Beagleboard:  ICEpick only, which you
make link in other things (Cortex-A8, C64x+ DSP, etc).
But that's not happening here; those signals pull low.

- Dave

(*) My understinding is that ICEpick v3 started out on
    DaVinci, and was then later adopted in OMAP3 along
    with the C64x+ DSP and some video hardware.
