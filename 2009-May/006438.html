Hmm, if you don't know ... then who could?

The process *does* seem, for now, as if it's largely
&quot;commit patches to SVN&quot; without any publicly defined
goals/targets or visible criteria.

Zack's &quot;list&quot; seemed useful in terms of having some
kind of direction be defined.  But that's distinct
from defining release criteria, or merge criteria.

Right *now*, what criteria are being used to choose
whether to merge a patch, reject it, or hold it back
until the next release?


Example:  there was a patch a while back (from Dick
Hollenbeck) that included about 60K of ft2232 and
TMS sequencing updates ... and gratuitous changes
to whitespace, and surely other things.  I don't
know of many projects which wouldn't also reject
such patches with &quot;please split into smaller patches
so this can be reviewed&quot;, as happened.

If that *had* been split and resubmitted ... there
seems to be no process in place to say which changes
are safe to merge *now* versus which can't merge
because they'd destabilize release plans, versus
which are worth merging even if they *do* destabilize
things (because e.g. fixing TMS bugs is critical).
