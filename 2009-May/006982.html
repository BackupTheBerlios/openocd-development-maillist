This is where the eyeballs are today.  Myself, I do not like web forums
and will not voluntarily spend my time on them.  Further, I am not keen
on splitting _developer_ eyeballs away from our &quot;singular focus&quot; herein.
I think the more good people we can recruit onto this list, the better
off the project will be in the long run.

Still, I would be happy knowing that a number of maintainers provide
regular presence in one such _user_ forum.  If that is the case with the
sparkfun forum, then I think David's suggestion to add it to the
openocd.texi user manual is spot on.  I say link from the main page too.
Many people do seem to prefer web-based interaction for reasons that I
will never personally understand, and I would like us to support that.

Our users _are_ developers, so I hope that those who join the list to
get an answer to their &quot;deep&quot; problems will stick around and help out.
We can still benefit from seeing more good eyeballs here, agreed?

&gt;<i> Better tool support can help development but here I think it is an 
</I>&gt;<i> attitude problem not a tool problem.
</I>
We cannot use such tools exclusively.  Some people have their own tools
for posting patches to mailing lists, and that is a de facto standard
for patch submission that we cannot simply change.  Thus, we are talking
about _adding_ a tool for reporting -- not switching.  

Such a move could easily divide the community eyeballs doing review,
which many believe are _starting_ to reach critical mass.  Today, this
mailing list is the current &quot;tool&quot; for almost all purposes, and I think
we all agree that adding _some_ new tool would be beneficial and easy.

Consequently, I think the issues are consensus and resource shortages:

1) Which bug/patch/report/tracking system?  I do not recall seeing a
clear consensus.

2) Will enough users and developers visit and use it often enough that
the extra work to bootstrap and maintain it for the effort to pay off?
I think success here will require overwhelming consensus on #1; lacking
that clear motive, there is no point in bootstrapping an effort. 

If we have enough users moving in the same direction, we could probably
do something; however, my observations say this will be impossible
unless we first define our requirements clearly.  I will post a new
thread on this topic shortly, as my original reply grew in scope to
deserve such treatment (twice over, to be honest).

Cheers,

Zach
