<PRE>There is some stuff in jtag.c that also must be merged in before
committing ft2232.c:


&#216;yvind,


I just wanted to remind you that my patch on Friday had the jtag.c in
it.  Since we have now split that up into source files, I am sending
you my copy again.  Without these changes, we would lose:


1)  the usage of the reduced clock table WHEN compiling for ft2232.c

2) the state transition specific comment layout.  When folks start
using the reduced clock table, there is large potential for problems
for awhile.  That is, in other drivers.  I don't feel this is the case
with ft2232.c since I did a good bit of testing.   However, there
needs to be a mechanism for folks to report on why a specific
starting_stable_state to ending_stable_state tuple may not work.  My C
language comment structure allowed folks to say why and what works.  I
had to change 2 entries from Jeff Williams table since they would not
work for ft2232.c.   I made these comments very explicit, why, what
cable, what CPU.  Look for tms_seqs[] in attached jtag.c


Having said that, my ft2232.c code can also work with the 7 clock
table.  This is a good test of whether the driver has really crossed
the bridge into reduced clock land.  They key is that it has to use

  int tap_get_tms_path_len(tap_state_t from, tap_state_t to);

and that it has a function in it like clock_tms() in ft2232.c.  By
having a single function to manipulate TMS like this, it makes it
easiest to through in the rigorous tap_set_state() calls which can be
turned on to provide state transition logging *through every state*.



This file cannot be committed until the ft2232.c driver is committed,
because the old driver will not work with the new table.


Dick
