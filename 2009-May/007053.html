Regarding the extension: It's Tradition. [[ *cue Broadway music* ]]
There are too many documents (and .cfg files themselves) to buck it.
OpenOCD has been around for a while, and this would seriously confuse
things for users reading docs (on external sites that we can't update).

Also, because they are not really TCL scripts.  They are Jim TCL
scripts, so -- if anything -- they should be renamed '.jim'....

Myself, I would agree to 'svn mv src/tcl ${DST}', DST=tcl or DST=jim.
Other opinions? [[ *music swells* -- exeunt ]]

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;board/*.cfg&quot; to grow enough that they'll

I was trying to punt this architectural work to Wookey, but I have
already posted a similar idea in my reply to Duane.   Since he expressed
the initial interest with the configuration files (and I know he can
handle the technical challenge), I was hoping to delegate this work,
either to him or someone else qualified....  Say... you would do....

If someone does not take charge, I will commit the ideas to The List.
Ultimately, it will take a SVN committer to make these changes, but
someone else could probably write a script that will take the proper
actions for us....
 
Cheers,

Zach
