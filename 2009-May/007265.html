<PRE>Is there any particular reason why the JTAG layer uses hardware resets (TRST)?

I would assume that the most portable way to go to TLR, the one that
works even if all reset lines are missing or are not yet or
incorrectly configured would be to shift out five HIGH bits which
leads to TLR regardless in which state the TAP is.

Currently the JTAG layer doesn't even offer this simple function. So I
am wondering if the people who conceived the reset machinery were
unaware of this TLR mechanism.

Unless there are good reasons (for example that we have cases where
going to TLR vs. asserting TRST produce differing results) I think the
reset lines should not be used from the JTAG layer at all, they should
be available to scripts (and possibly targets, but I think even that
is bad design for generic CPU drivers).

My suggestion would be to expose the resets as a generic GPIO layer
that is available to scripts. An initial system reset (if that is
available in a system) could be generated via a configuration command.
Asserting TRST is from what I understand redundant, I don't see the
use in doing all the extra work that is done currently by the JTAG
layer to try to use that.

Also I strongly suspect that the many recent reports on the list of
varying behavior when starting openocd several times in a row may be a
result of failed attempts to reset the TAP state via hardware lines.
At least we should consider adding the five 1's mechanism to the JTAG
initialization to reduce potential for such errors.
