I had to coin a phrase.  An example of a system config
file would be &quot;openocd.cfg&quot; ... basic template

	source [find interface/...cfg]
	source [find board/...cfg]
	... define task and environment specific utilities ...

You may be using &quot;user's config file&quot; in a similar way.
I didn't notice that term being defined anywhere either!

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So these are *targets* that don't need or want
</I>&gt;<i> TRST?
</I>
In the Atmel case, yes.

In the TI case, no.  TI boards often come with
both &quot;TI-14&quot; and &quot;ARM-20&quot; JTAG connectors.
So whether you have SRST depends on which kind
of JTAG adapter you use ... not the board, not
the CPU.

 
&gt;<i> I was referring to the interface not supporting
</I>&gt;<i> TRST.
</I>
Couldn't tell ... :)

It's the same sort of issue though:  one of the
signals is not passed through.

Other examples include RTCK, DBG{REQ,ACK}, EMU{0,1},
EVTO, and surely more...


&gt;<i> I don't understand how one could infer that srst
</I>&gt;<i> is tied to trst by specifying trst_disable...
</I>
Huh?  Me either.  I don't think I said or even
implied any such thing; where did that come from?

 
&gt;<i> W.r.t. #3 I'm not keen because it's nice to be able
</I>&gt;<i> to tinker with various combinations from telnet instead
</I>&gt;<i> of having to &quot;reboot&quot; the system...
</I>
I had thought about that.  Such tinkering would only
make sense when experimenting to find an initial working
config, or so I concluded.  Ever afterwards, you would
not need to tinker.


&gt;<i> I'm also not entirely 
</I>&gt;<i> convinced that reset scripts might need to tinker with
</I>&gt;<i> reset_config options during reset itself(seems far-fetch
</I>&gt;<i> today though).
</I>
If they need such tinkering, that says to me that
something more complicated is going on ... so the
current &quot;reset_config&quot; is not a good answer.  But
since there's no current need for such messiness,
that is not a a good reason not to adopt #3.
