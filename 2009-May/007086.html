</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Info : J-Link compiled Feb 20 2006 18:20:20 -- Update --
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Info : JLink caps 0x3

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;       
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Open OCD seems to get reasonable ansvers from first two JLink commands.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The /* query hardware maximum memory block */ should not be run for this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; version, I had removed it in my patch. Next patch will use results from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; JLink caps to select what info to query.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I am waiting for more info from Segger about version diffrences and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; endpoints.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;     
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How are we doing with this patch?  It looks like we have made some good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; progress this week, so I don't want the effort to stall.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What are the thoughts about committing your latest version?  Even if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more changes may be pending, it seems that your work has improved things
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for folks with some devices, so I think we have made constructive
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; progress from where we were before now.  If nothing else, we should get
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some more testing feedback. ;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> There is a set of new patches that has been tested by Michael Fischer, 
</I>&gt;<i> as far as i know there were no problems.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are still things that should be fixed in the resethandling in 
</I>&gt;<i> jtag_add_reset and minimizing the differences between ft2232 and jlink 
</I>&gt;<i> behaviour.
</I>&gt;<i> But still would suggest that the following patcches are commited. They 
</I>&gt;<i> are not untested.
</I>
I will apply them here and see if they magically cure my own woes.
Regardless, I think these changes should be committed in some for,
though I can see various ways that I would like to clean your code.
Would you mind my taking a pass over them before I commit them?

Incidentally, do you think this might also solve the problem that was
just reported by Dylan Reid?  I have cc'd him in the hope that he will
try your patches and report the latest results.

Cheers,

Zach
