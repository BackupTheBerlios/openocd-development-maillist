I had similar thoughts.  I thought folk more expert in
JTAG would be better to explore such things.  There's
this &#216;yvind guy at your company, for example ... ;)

There's an interface layer in URjtag, with things like
ft2232 and parport support; plus of course JTAG calls.

An alternate question would be:  couldn't the OOCD core
be replaced with the URjtag core?  Or vice versa?  (NOT
that I'm proposing that be done.  I'm just pointing out
functional similarities.  Projects won't necessarily
merge or cooperate like that; nor should they.  Having
some competition is good.)


The URjtag stuff uses a different strategy for setup:
it detects the devices on the chain, then configures
itself based on their IDs. (Using either its own config
files, or BSDL if that's enabled.)  The config files
are purely descriptive, and can't say much ... reading
between the lines, I've suspected a testing/SVF focus.

Now, I actually prefer that model to the current OOCD
model of needing to say &quot;this is what you shall find&quot;.
That's something of a PITA, speaking just as a user,
especially for things which *can* be autoconfigured.

And in fact, I'm not the only person who's found it
handy to use URjtag to look at what's there, so they
can come up with an OOCD configuration.


BUT ... my vague practical experience suggests that
maybe, just maybe, not *all* JTAG chains support that
discovery model correctly.  Making me think that the
better model might indeed prefer autoconfiguring, but
accomodate the &quot;this is what you'll be seeing&quot; model
too.

Plus, obviously, there will need to be backlinks from
the discovered IDs into the config process.  Like the
&quot;debug&quot; versions of the DaVinci scan chains, which
start (TDI) with an ICEpick -- with the actual SoC
identifier, and hosting the boundary scan -- then add
a device which we &quot;know&quot; is an ARM926ejs core even if
it doesn't use ARM's manufacturer code, then an ETB11
which *does* use ARM's code.  Likewise its non-&quot;debug&quot;
sibling, which works like OMAP3 cores ... gotta talk to
that router to get other cores into the scan chain, as
those are the things that GDB will eventually talk to.
