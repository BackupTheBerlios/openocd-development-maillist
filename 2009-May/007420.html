Thanks...


&gt;<i> &gt; However, there are still six flash drivers that

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are still a mess (albeit now a *localized* mess);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> More generally, I am wondering how many users are using this driver.
</I>&gt;<i> There do not appear to be any examples of the usage of it in the tcl/

</I>&gt;<i> like Spencer Oliver committed that code originally in 2007, so I've cc'd
</I>&gt;<i> him to ensure we get his feedback.
</I>
Likewise the &quot;ocl&quot; driver, although at least that one
isn't painful to document.  The main issue there seems
to be a complete lack of description about what an &quot;ocl&quot;
might be.  The ECOS flash driver is cryptic too.

 
&gt;<i> &gt; and the &quot;mflash&quot; stuff still looks kind of like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it doesn't really belong in that chapter.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have cc'd unsik Kim to see what he thinks might be done, since he is
</I>&gt;<i> the principle author of that code and recently updated those sections.
</I>
I suspect it should just be its own chapter.

But one thing that's missing is a description
of just what an &quot;mflash&quot; is.  &quot;mflash.com&quot;
seems unrelated.  :)
 
 
&gt;<i> David, could I talk you into taking a stab at the newly added Texinfo
</I>&gt;<i> sections of The Manual? [1,2] &#160;I think a guide for preferred markup and
</I>&gt;<i> style would help clean up the documentation as much the C style guide
</I>&gt;<i> should help clean up the code. &#160;
</I>
Maybe.  I'm just going by the texinfo manual, which
isn't especially hard to understand.

 
&gt;<i> You seem to understand Texinfo, and I figure your recent efforts should
</I>&gt;<i> mean the information is still fresh in your brain. &#160;If the Doxygen
</I>&gt;<i> markup poses an obstacle, I recommend reading the Doxygen Primer and
</I>&gt;<i> Style Guide (and providing feedback). ;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At the very least, it would be nice to have fairly direct links to
</I>&gt;<i> on-line documentation and tutorials (as I will do with the links I
</I>&gt;<i> posted for learning LaTeX). &#160;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With driver information and style guidance, others can take a look at
</I>&gt;<i> the str9xpec part of the manual and audit the driver commands and code.
</I>
The str9xpec stuff has a significant *conceptual* issue to
resolve first.  Then formatting stuff will be easy.

But needing a complete secondary driver just to set a few
things which other drivers handle using a few driver-specific
commmands ... seems doomed to be forevermore confusing.
