<PRE>There has been some speculation that I have some evil
plans with the recent changes. Not so.

I just made a few wrong assumptions about how this would
pan out, planned badly and made a few crucial mistakes
in execution. Poof!

Again: sorry for the mess. Damage done, I'm trying best
as I can to clean up as quickly as possible. There are no
known regressions in svn head as of writing(except
that Magnus reported an assert that he can't reproduce yet).

Since I want to give the patient a bit of rest before I start
committing performance fixes, I'm currently profiling &amp; staying ready
to jump in and address any problems you guys are suffering
due to my latest brutal experimentation on svn head.

The ZY1000 went from 407 to 307kBytes/s upload on ARM7, so rest
assured that I've got no evil motives in bringing down the
performance of USB vs. embedded host and that I'll attend to the
performance problems as soon as the patient is well enough
to be operated on. Profiling meanwhile... :-)

I started this in_handler stuff not because I have some ulterior
motive, but because I had idle time on my hands this week
(not anymore!), and then I started on this pet project to clean
things up once and for all.

We have a major new testing round planned(we've got lots of
target boards and several interfaces that we are going to test
on here). Thanks to everybody who has contributed targets!

I'm postponing that large regression testing round(it takes time!)
until Zach has finished his pile of patches and things seem
generally quiet.

I really do believe that the OpenOCD svn head will calm down
*a lot* once this huge round of changes &amp; cleanup is done.

Also, I believe that OpenOCD is only it is small beginnings and
that it is important that we take this unique oportunity to clean
things up now. Once the user crowd grows, this will be
harder and harder.

I'm looking forward to seing what the result will
be of Zach's solitiation of what policies to use for OpenOCD.

If there is a single positive aspect of this whole in_handler
mess, it's that an OpenOCD policy probably will be set that is
much more orderly than what we have today. Also I believe
that the group will be much more appreciative of the extra
time &amp; patience such a policy requires.

Again: sorry for the mess. I'm now trying to clean it all up
and things are looking much better than they did just hours
ago.
