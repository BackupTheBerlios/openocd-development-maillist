<PRE>Something strikes me as pretty broken here.  Maybe I am seeing ghosts.

I put in a few prints to see what was going on, then got confused and
ran from the debugger.  This is what I found:


static int jlink_get_version_info(void)
{
       int result;
       int len;
       u32 jlink_caps, jlink_max_size;

       /* query hardware version */
       jlink_simple_command(EMU_CMD_VERSION);

       result = jlink_usb_read(jlink_jtag_handle, 2);
       if (2 != result)
       {
///***** Sometimes this fails, that doesn't seem to matter
               LOG_ERROR(&quot;J-Link command EMU_CMD_VERSION failed
(%d)\n&quot;, result);
               return ERROR_JTAG_DEVICE_ERROR;
       }
///***** most of the time it works and we get to here
///***** Problem is that what is read is &quot;J-&quot; the first two bytes of
the jlink identifier string
       len = buf_get_u32(usb_in_buffer, 0, 16);
///***** len now holds 11594, which is what buf_get_u32 returns when
it is fed &quot;J-&quot;
       result = jlink_usb_read(jlink_jtag_handle, len);
///***** jlink_usb_read doesn't check the length of the buffer before reading
///*****  so it wipes out a bunch of variables including jlink_jtag_handle
       if (result != len)
       {
               LOG_ERROR(&quot;J-Link command EMU_CMD_VERSION read failed
(%d)\n&quot;, result);
               return ERROR_JTAG_DEVICE_ERROR;
       }


The crazy thing is that sometimes this works.  Often enough to be
usable actually.  I added a check to jlink_usb_read and it makes it
fail every time.  I attached the patch as I think it is the right
thing to do anyways.  If you increase JLINK_IN_BUFFER_SIZE to
something big enough, it will keep it functional.

I don't have any experience with low level jtag interfacing, what is
this code trying to do?  Should something other than &quot;J-&quot; be returned
after EMU_CMD_VERSION?

Wish I had more time to debug this tonight, but if I don't get home
for memorial day weekend the GF is not going to be too happy :-)
