More generally, I am wondering how many users are using this driver.
There do not appear to be any examples of the usage of it in the tcl/
tree, though the mailing list might have something archived.  It looks
like Spencer Oliver committed that code originally in 2007, so I've cc'd
him to ensure we get his feedback.

&gt;<i> and the &quot;mflash&quot; stuff still looks kind of like
</I>&gt;<i> it doesn't really belong in that chapter.
</I>
I have cc'd unsik Kim to see what he thinks might be done, since he is
the principle author of that code and recently updated those sections.


David, could I talk you into taking a stab at the newly added Texinfo
sections of The Manual? [1,2]  I think a guide for preferred markup and
style would help clean up the documentation as much the C style guide
should help clean up the code.  

You seem to understand Texinfo, and I figure your recent efforts should
mean the information is still fresh in your brain.  If the Doxygen
markup poses an obstacle, I recommend reading the Doxygen Primer and
Style Guide (and providing feedback). ;)

At the very least, it would be nice to have fairly direct links to
on-line documentation and tutorials (as I will do with the links I
posted for learning LaTeX).  


With driver information and style guidance, others can take a look at
the str9xpec part of the manual and audit the driver commands and code.

Cheers,

Zach
