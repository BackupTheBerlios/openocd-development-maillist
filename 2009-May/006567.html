<PRE>Hi all,

If anyone knows of patches that have not been applied, please reply here
with a link into the mailing list archives to the last version posted:

	<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/</A>

If there are other issues to which the maintainers failed to respond,
please consider posting links to them as well.  You do not need to be
the original author or contributor of the patches; you only need to
remember that we overlooked/ignored/rejected them.  Once this seems
done, I will update The List in the repository to help track them.

Patches do not need apply cleanly to the latest trunk, but that would be
nice bonus for us (so feel free to submit newer versions).  In any case,
all contributions will valued (by me, at least), and I will try to
ensure that everyone receives a reply from someone qualified to review
or apply it.  I will also try to update older patches to apply to trunk.

Please note: this is strategic planning, and not for the 0.2.0 release.
I know that several of the outstanding patches may not be suitable due
to their potential impact, but that is all the more reason to make sure
we have all of our ducks in a row for when the release is finished.

Cheers,

Zach
