</I>
That would make the implementations unnecessary complex. And you
duplicate a lot of logic in each driver.

I would even remove the 'if' that causes the TAP_RESET-&gt;TAP_RESET to
be ignored because such an optimization should be performed uniformly
for all JTAG devices by the jtag.c layer.

&gt;&gt;<i> I think in case of TAP_RESET, an exception to that rule might be useful.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Would it make sense to define that a driver has to make sure a requested
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> TAP_RESET end state really ends in TAP_RESET state, regardless of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> previous state, ie. the driver needs to always perform the necessary
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> number of clocks with TMS=1 without any clever optimizations?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That way, upper layers would have an easy way to re-synchronize state
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even if openocd and the target do not agree on what the current state is.
</I>
My preferred solution would be to keep statemove simple (just the
table lookup) and add a JTAG_TLR_RESET instruction to the interface
which in turn would just clock out the 1's.

In the long run we could then add an undefined tap state (for example
TAP_INVALID) and enforce that only the jtag_add_tlr command can be
called from that. This would help finding reset problems not only
after startup but also when a system reset is performed (which would
set that as well).

&gt;<i> I see your point and I basically agree, the problem is that state_move
</I>&gt;<i> uses the state move table(s), that currently do use 7 step reset-&gt;reset
</I>&gt;<i> transitions, but there is no &quot;contract&quot; for this.
</I>
I would prefer the contract in the end to be &quot;move within the table
with well-defined start and end states&quot; to make it as simple as
possible. Whatever can be done in jtag.c should be done there to avoid
code duplication and to avoid inconsistent behavior when changing JTAG
interfaces. That includes the differentiation between a vanilla
statemove and a TLR from undefined state. And it includes turning a
statemove into a NOP if start state and end state are equal (and if
that is the behavior that the community in fact wants).

&gt;<i> I also dislike the idea of having to put exceptions like this in the
</I>&gt;<i> interface drivers. &#160;I think we also should look into how
</I>&gt;<i> jtag_add_runtest is handled because this is a similar situation where we
</I>&gt;<i> want to reach a certain endstate and then guarante a certain number of
</I>&gt;<i> transitions in this state.
