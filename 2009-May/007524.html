<PRE>All,
(especially david &amp; zach, you seem to do this very well).

Yes, this is some what &quot;off-topic&quot; for this list, but it is on topic 
because the list wants &quot;small more reviewable patches&quot;. To that end, I'm 
looking for a better way to deal with patch sets, etc.

I've noticed that for example some post a nice series of 10 patches... 
each a minor step... in total quite a lot, and the poster tends to do 
all of these patches at once.

Problem #1.
========

Yea, I can create an SVN patch - from HEAD, but that's not what I'm 
looking for. For example - if I have 5 changes to a file, and they are 
standalone patches, I do the work 'independently' - ie: change 1 today, 
change 2 tomorrow, etc.

Other then manually editing the resulting &quot;cumulative patch&quot; (a nasty 
job) - what better way or tool is there to do this?

Problem #2
========

So those patches are posted... on the list, waiting for stuff, and I 
have other things to deal with.  Creating the next patch, for a 
different file - or set of files is again painfully manual.

Isn't there some way to say: &quot;Hey patch tool - you already know about 
those first 5 changes in Problem #1&quot;  please ... assume those are done, 
and create my patch file based on that.

How can I do that? Again, other then manually editing the patch file, or 
manually creating crazy command lines to do the diffs/patch generation.

========

Ideas, suggestions, techniques would be quite helpful for me.

-Duane.
