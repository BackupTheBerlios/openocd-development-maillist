Thanks for the feedback.


&gt;<i> &gt; The &quot;==&gt;&quot; comments are things which seem like they deserve some action
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other than documenting the current status. &#160;One example is removing (or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at least disabling) the &quot;nand copy&quot; command until it gets implemented.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Implementing it in a generic way would be quite slow if the data has to 
</I>&gt;<i> make the round trip to the host and back to the target over the JTAG 
</I>&gt;<i> link. &#160;Ideally each controller driver would need to implement its own 
</I>&gt;<i> copy method which would involve uploading some code on the target in 
</I>&gt;<i> order to perform the copy directly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Still I don't see this as being really useful, otherwise someone would 
</I>&gt;<i> have implemented it by now. &#160;So disabling it is probably the best option 
</I>&gt;<i> for the moment.
</I>
OK, I'll send a patch doing that, soonish.


I also noticed that two commands (erase, check_bad) are
unusual in that they require *block* numbers as parameters,
rather than the offsets used everywhere else in OpenOCD
(and in U-Boot, and the Linux-MTD utilities).

Comments on changing that to become more consistent, and
holding off on documenting/committing-to the current
interface until this issue is resolved?
