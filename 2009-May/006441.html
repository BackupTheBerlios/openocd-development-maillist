</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Well,  since it is more than five days old I suppose it is dead fish.
But I can tell you that all the state transition stuff works well, both 
in 7 state version and and shortest path.
There are some issues about PAUSE -&gt; SCAN paths does not go through  
CAPTURE, but this path is never used in the present code.
I do not know about  high speed  ft2232h and ft4232h since I havnt got 
any such hardware.
Reconnect looks ok but not tested.

Best regards,
Magnus
