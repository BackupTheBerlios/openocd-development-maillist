<PRE>Hello list,

I have make a big smoketest with the r1606. But this is not
an original r1606, some small modifications was made.

Many thanks to Magnus Lundin to solve the problems here.

#1, problem with SAM7S and old flash driver
============================================
at91sam7_old.c, here near line 370, the line:

at91sam7_old_info-&gt;num_planes = 1;

was placed befor:

at91sam7_old_read_clock_info(bank);

Now it looks like:

/* Read main and master clock freqency register */
at91sam7_old_info-&gt;num_planes = 1;
at91sam7_old_read_clock_info(bank);

#2, problem to get the J-Link working
======================================
jtag.c, the malloc from jtag_build_buffer was replaced by calloc:

bit_count = jtag_scan_size(cmd);
//*buffer = malloc(CEIL(bit_count, 8));
*buffer = calloc(1,CEIL(bit_count, 8));

#3, J-Link
===========
Here I use the jlink.c from 1686 instead of 1606


How the smoketest was done. The test was done with the following
targets: LPC2148, LPC2294, STR710, AT91R4008, SAM7S256, SAM7X256,
SAM7SE512 and STM32F103ZE.


Windows (FT2232)
=================
In case of Windows only the FT2232 was tested, here with a JTAGkey.
First with Insight, here the program was downloaded into RAM. I played
a little with the debugger. Close the debugger, and start again with
a RAM download. After this the program was downloaded into Flash. The
same procedure, twice time.

Now telnet is used to check if the flash is empty, and to erase the
flash. After the Insight session, I use Eclipse. Here the same procedure
with RAM / ROM, twice time. And check/erase with telnet.

Exception:
- In case of AT91R4008, SAM7SE512 and STM32F103ZE only the RAM test was
made.

Resources:
- WindowsXP SP2
- Eclipse 3.4.1 with Zylin plugin 4.5.1


Mac OS X (FT2232/J-Link)
=========================
Here the J-Link and FT2232 was used, but only with Eclipse.
The test was made with only LPC2148, LPC2294, STR710, SAM7S256
and STM32F103ZE. But each test with FT2232 and J-Link.

Exception:
- In case of STM32F103ZE only the RAM test was made.

Resources:
- Mac OS X, 10.5.6 (intel)
- Eclipse 3.4.1 with Zylin plugin 4.5.1
- J-Link (V8)

I have created no patch, because the actual version is to much
away from 1606.

It looks that the 1606 have some problems with the following
commands and big data to transfer:

monitor arm7_9 fast_memory_access enable
monitor arm7_9 dcc_downloads enable
monitor verify_ircapture disable

Here my speed test do not work stable.

But this need further inquiries, which I should make with
the head version too.

Btw, binaries can be found at my page: <A HREF="http://www.yagarto.de/">http://www.yagarto.de/</A>

Best regards,

Michael
