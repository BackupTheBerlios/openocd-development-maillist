<PRE>One of the reasons that plans change dramatically is that
suddenly we have resources to get stuff done :-)

We can't decide when we will have resources and what those
resources want to work on.... If someone steps up with
a great patch, then I'd apply it to svn head. If we need
a release branch we can cut that from some *older* version
of svn head if need be.  Also we absolutely have to apply
patches as soon as possible to coordinate work. Patches
are like fresh fish &amp; guests: 5 days at the most!
This is why we apply pretty much anything to svn head and
cut release branches.

So rather than making a plan, I guess we have to try to predict
and coordinate what direction OpenOCD is moving in... That's
as close as you are going to get to a plan. Zach has collected
and posted this to the list. I guess in a week or two we'll see
a revised list...

One thing is for sure: I'm glad all this noise is happening
*before* 0.2 release... I would advise against cutting a branch
until things have settled down.

*My* only plan at this point is to fix bugs &amp; performance
regressions, I don't have anything else major planned.

I don't know when the cats can be herded into a 0.2 release
at this point, but I'm pretty sure it's a month away at least.

I don't know of a better predictor of # of changes to svn head
than last week * 90%.
