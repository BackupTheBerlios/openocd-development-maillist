I'm not fond of making branches to serve as the &quot;trunk after the  
release&quot;.  That just makes a lot of work for the release maintainer to  
straighten out the tree later.  Now, I'm all for having large features  
developed on branches.

&gt;<i> (Or what lots of folk do:  private &quot;quilt&quot; series, updated as

I encourage developers to use tools like git-svn or quilt to build and  
maintain patchsets until they can be integrated into the trunk.

A while back, we had kicked around a tentative date of 7/1.  I'm not  
tied to it by any means, but it does seem to provide sufficient time  
to stabilize.  As for doing RCs, I like to start that in the last 2  
week window when the accepted patches are few and the branch has been  
cut.  That way the RCs are tagged from the branch and things are  
already pretty stable.

it with him.&quot;
