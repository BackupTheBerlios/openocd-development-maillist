True, but I did qualify my statement with &quot;at their extremes.&quot;  The real
world is not binary, but I love to talk about it like it is.

Your point about &quot;positive feedback loops&quot; is excellent though, and I
agree that is another benefit that answers the &quot;why&quot;. :)

&gt;<i> All that's needed is to pick a target release period:  just how
</I>&gt;<i> frequently should there be new OpenOCD releases?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First one was late January.  Late June should be doable for the

</I>
I think it is.  At the current pace of development, I think that we
should be shooting at every couple of months.  However, a temporal goal
is only one way to view release schedules.

I read somewhere (not that long ago) that one should choose release
schedules based on features _or_ based on dates.  So, the community
could choose to finish features X, Y, and Z _or_ to finish by the Nth of
some Month.  We should _not_ attempt to set both goals -- no wiggle room
will be left to push back the schedule or drop features.  I think this
is excellent advice and a policy that I want applied to my projects.

A shade of gray might be considered as well, but I like the clarity
implied by these black-and-white schemes.  They objectify the process,
whereas a mix would require some degree of subjective decision making.
We are human: nothing will be completely objective.  Still, I think
clear policies would help avoid most bruised egos and hurt feelings.

In the end, the RM should be the single person to make these decisions.

&gt;<i> &gt; We must find a happy medium 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so both processes can flow smoothly.  Mostly, this means empowering that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; individual to lead the decision to release and having the rest of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maintainers comply with the restrictions thusly imposed (merge windows).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd have said there needs to be enough of a team commitment
</I>&gt;<i> that supporting the RM's decision making for each release is
</I>&gt;<i> a complete no-brainer; and enough of a team that one person
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't need to be RM all the time.
</I>
Again, my binary reductionism gets me into trouble.  Clearly, there
should be give and take on both parts, but the central idea here is one
of responsibilities: only the RM needs to be responsible for leading the
process forward.  That responsibility should be fairly minimal, because
-- yes -- the other developers should be supportive of the process.

This gets us back to the point of positive feedback loops.  If we manage
the release process correctly, then it will make the developers want to
help make more releases.  The RM should have a very easy job to do.

Cheers,

Zach
