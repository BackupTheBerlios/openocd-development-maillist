<PRE>This patch is large and:

**  allows the ft2232 cable to be detached and reattached without having 
to restart openocd.

** supports the high speed ftdi part (not tested)

** supports the reduced clock tms_seq table.

** modifies the reduce tms_seq table so that is worked with ARM9 and 
Olimnex and establishes
   a transition specific comment/documentation format for the reduced 
clock table, in jtag.c

** provides a reference implementation for any other drivers wishing to 
add reduced clock support.

If you have difficulty with this patch, your first line of defense is to 
change this line from

#if 1 &amp;&amp; ((BUILD_FT2232_FTD2XX==1) || (BUILD_FT2232_LIBFTDI==1))

to

#if 0 &amp;&amp; ((BUILD_FT2232_FTD2XX==1) || (BUILD_FT2232_LIBFTDI==1))

in jtag.c

You will not have problems if you are not using the ft2232.c driver. 

If you are using the ft2232.c driver, in theory you will have less 
problems   :) when using this patch.

I especially like the ability to detach and reconnect the cable without 
restarting openocd, because I have to burn one board after another 
coming off the assembly line.


The asserts in the driver are enabled by default.  If you want to turn 
them off, then define NDEBUG on the compiler command line.  There should 
be no rush to do that however because I doubt they represent any kind of 
bottleneck.


My CMake scripts support both a Debug and Release build and handles that 
for you.

 From here I will be going on to the xsvf.c work.


Let me know if there are any problems.


Dick
