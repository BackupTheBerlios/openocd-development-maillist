<PRE>Hi, I've been doing quite a lot of beating my head against open OCD
over the last few weeks in order to get it working with balloonboard.
Results detailed at
<A HREF="http://www.balloonboard.org/balloonwiki/Balloon3OpenOCD">http://www.balloonboard.org/balloonwiki/Balloon3OpenOCD</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.balloonboard.org/balloonwiki/BalloonJTAGing">http://www.balloonboard.org/balloonwiki/BalloonJTAGing</A>

I have various comments, queries and patches as a result. I'll try to
separate them by subject rather than one big mail. 

first nice simple one. The pxa270.cfg is wrong. When I started it
still had old-style config lines but it looks likes that's been fixed
in svn. It still has a line for a flash chip on some random board
which clearly shouldn't be in the generic pxa270.cfg file, so my patch
removes it. That should be in the board config.

This patch also lists the two CPU IDs I've found in testing. This leads
on to two related points about how the CPUTAPID thing is used.

1) How do I specify that a bit is don't care for -expected-id? As you
can see pxas can be (at least) rev 7 and rev4: 0x79265013 and
0x49265013. Either of these answers is valid, but I failed to find a
'don't care' mask.

2) Also the &lt;cpu&gt;.cfg files set a duff CPUTAPID, and seem to expect a
CPUTAPID to be passed in from some higher-level config. But it seems
to me that in general the user doesn't know this value and would
expect it (or at least the default) to be supplied in the &lt;cpu&gt;.cfg
file? Am I misunderstanding how it is supposed to be used?

3) Also doesn't the reset capability depend on the
board/dongle/interface combination and thus sadly doesn't really go in
the cpu config file, much as we'd like it to? e.g. I get different
reset capabilities with USB and parallel dongles onto the same board,
so a generic pxa reset config cannot be correct. Perhaps the idea is
that the file specifies a likely default and that is overridden later
in the main config if it's not right for you?
