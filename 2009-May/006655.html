I also noticed that needed going.  I have a few small updates,
mostly of the &quot;this doc is missing/incomplete&quot; variety.

Yeah, whoever does that gets to understand the code a LOT better!

I suggest you focus on small/reviewable doc patches, and don't
get too antsy when review/merge doesn't happen right away.

Also, before you dive in wholesale ... I suggest you start with
a few areas that have particularly bugged you.  One thing you
have *right now* is a fairly fresh outlook, which means you'll
have a very different understanding than you will a few months
from now (when you've become a jaded old campaigner).  Capture
those fresh insights while you can, before your mind gets too
well trained about where it should have blind spots.  ;)


&gt;<i> those more experienced in the source  
</I>&gt;<i> will have to verify my comment blocks. &#160;I have also noticed that the 
</I>&gt;<i> comments are rather lacking, so this seems like a good idea to me.
</I>
Yes, better doc is always good ... and you're very right that
doc patches need particular review attention.  For the doxygen
stuff, please focus on the higher level interfaces first, and
try to capture the &quot;why&quot; not just the &quot;what&quot;.
