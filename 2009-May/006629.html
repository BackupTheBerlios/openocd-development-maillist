<PRE>Hey all,

I've been eagerly watching this mailing list for quite some time now, 
waiting until I was out of school to start trying to do something.  One 
of the things I was interested in tackling is the great need for more 
documentation on OpenOCD.  What I wanted to know is if there is a need 
for some one to poke through the documentation, aka openocd.texi, to 
look for grammatical and spelling errors as well as places where further 
explanation may be a good thing.  I don't know if anyone is already 
doing this, so I wanted to check in.  Another thing I wanted to check in 
on was the state of comments in many of the source files.  Something I 
have wanted to do is to go through everything and add the doxygen style 
comments so that the Doxyfile could be worth something.  I don't mind 
attempting to tackle this because it will help me to better understand 
the framework behind OpenOCD, but those more experienced in the source 
will have to verify my comment blocks.  I have also noticed that the 
comments are rather lacking, so this seems like a good idea to me.

On another note, I'm going to start working harder with Chitlesh Goorah, 
CC'd, on packaging the RPM for Fedora for OpenOCD.  Chitlesh has a 
desire to get OpenOCD pushed into the Fedora Electronics Lab (FEL) 
distribution and I really want to learn the process of packaging for 
Fedora.  I figure it's a win-win-win.

At any rate, let me know if I have support to start submitting patches 
regarding source commenting and the documentation for OpenOCD.  If not 
that, let me know what I can do to support the project and focus my 
eager energy.  Thanks.

// Dean Glazeski
