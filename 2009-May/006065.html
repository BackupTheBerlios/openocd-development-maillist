I believe you misunderstood.  I'm open to hearing Dick's proposal if  
it is actually a proposal on how to move forward with OpenOCD.  Per  
his statement, that isn't what he was offering.  He was drafting the  
proposal to gauge whether or not his fork should be public or not.   
There was no statement that he was interested in continuing work on  
OpenOCD.

What I am against is having the openocd list being used for organizing  
Dick's fork.  If he wants to fork, then great.  He can setup a  
website, mailing list, source repo, etc.

&quot;He said he hadn't had a byte in three days. I had a short, so I split  
it with him.&quot;
