</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Allright! I need to write a driver somewhere in the next couple of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; weeks/months (when the JTAG programmer hardware arrives). Perhaps I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; can sketch/write some outlines on putting a driver together. I just 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; don't know how this would work with the current version of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OpenOCD. A 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; lot seems to be happening lately (which is good!) but I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not sure the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; current driver model is still the same as version 0.1.0.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Excellent. :)  We definitely need more documentation writers!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I recommend writing documentation for the current trunk.  I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just added &quot;doc/manual/&quot; in r1771 to provide the basic 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; skeleton for OpenOCD's high-level doxygen documentation 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (which others can flesh out over time).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think what you describe should be a stand-alone document 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that reads more like a tutorial that a reference, and I have 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; realized the need for more of such works by incorporating a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Technical Primers&quot; section in the doxygen output.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please consider writing it iteratively and incrementally as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you develop the driver, posting revisions for community to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; review just as you might the code.  I think this work could 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; produce common driver standards and then catalyze development 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to clean-up the existing drivers to meet them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would suggest starting the file, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;doc/manual/primer/jtag-driver.txt&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Write a doxygen comment block to contain the tutorial, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; similar to the skeleton files now in the tree.  Using 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doxygen's own documentation, you should be able to make your 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; content appear in the proper section of the new OpenOCD 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Technical Primers page.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Zach,
</I>&gt;<i> I have two issues with that: 
</I>&gt;<i> First the document will probably in Word (.doc) format to include both
</I>&gt;<i> text and pictures. Plain text is just too limited. I suppose I can
</I>&gt;<i> provide the images in a different format as well. Text is easy to
</I>&gt;<i> extract / Word documents can be read by OpenOffice. My document layout
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't contain fancy stuff anyway.
</I>
Doxygen can embed images.  It can do pretty looking formatting too.
It is text with mark-up, so don't discard it out of hand.  

Plain text is the universal data format (particularly from a version
control perspective), so will you still allow the community to extract
any relevant information and absorb it into the doxygen manual?

&gt;<i> Secondly I'm planning to use version 0.1.0 with the patches I made. I
</I>&gt;<i> need to push 'my' JTAG programmer project forward as fast as possible. I
</I>&gt;<i> don't want to skip documentation, but I can't spend time on debugging
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD at this moment. I'm willing to give r1771 a try (or any other
</I>&gt;<i> revision that is 'guaranteed' to work), but if it doesn't work from the
</I>&gt;<i> box I have to stick with version 0.1.0.
</I>
&gt;<i>From what it sounds like, most folks have their platforms working as
</I>well as they did at 0.1.0, with perhaps a few exceptions. 

If you are writing a new driver, I think you will be much better off
writing against the trunk, but you know your project better than I do.
I can definitely understand your concern with using a stable branch,but
I hope that we can regain your trust with the trunk.  Hearing that a
developer writing new device support does not want to use the latest
version of the code for new development shows we have room to improve.

Cheers,

Zach
