</I>
The &quot;test suite&quot; was just started recently (look in src/target/test/).
It's a work-in-progress, but the goal will be to &quot;connect the dots&quot;
between scripts like this and a my current work.

&gt;<i> One way to aggregate the data would be to create a web form that users
</I>&gt;<i> could fill out manually, but also have another perl script in the test
</I>&gt;<i> suite that could automatically fill out the form. The most elegant way
</I>&gt;<i> would be to tie the form directly to the SQL database, but for
</I>&gt;<i> something quick &amp; dirty we could just use a google form like this:
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=cnpOSWRCcE9DRjl1a3E5NURnUFQ4Rnc6MA..">https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=cnpOSWRCcE9DRjl1a3E5NURnUFQ4Rnc6MA..</A>), and then pull a csv file of the data when we wanted to. Just a thought. I know some PERL &amp; SQL so I'm willing to help out.
</I>
My initial plan was simply to allow a script to call sendmail (SMTP), as
I can create an account to receive the messages and deliver them into
the DB.  However, Duane has me re-considering my backup plan to just
using curl and a web form. 

Either way, the contents will be generated from a locally run script
(probably perl, but maybe just shell).  I imagine the user involvement
requiring at most two steps (after setup):

0) Configure your user-preferences.
1) Choose the interface and target to test (platform may be inferred).
2) Run 'make INTERFACE=X TARGET=Y smoketest' (or something similar).
  - For some platforms, may run it from OpenOCD's built-in web server.

For users with only one system configuration to test, Step 1 should only
need to be done once.  Thus, many users should simply be able to run the
last command, after 'make setup_smoketest' perhaps.  In theory.

The purpose of TAB-delimited files would be to allow trivial importing
into an SQL database, which I have considered required from the start
(just not for the very first version).

Cheers,

Zach
