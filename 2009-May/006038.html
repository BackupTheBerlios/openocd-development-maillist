<PRE>Hi,

I've been playing with the Flyswatter, OpenOCD and my Beagle Board.

And I would like to see the serial output from the beagle, routhed 
through the B port of the flyswatter, but for some reason, it seems 
OpenOCD via libftdi (v0.13) is blocking up the whole FT22232 Device, 
regardless that only port A is selected. 

If I have a terminal connected to port B, it stops working as soon as I 
start OpenOCD.

One possibility would be allow the data to be routed to the telnet 
session.  A  &quot;target&quot; command, which could work like this.

 &gt; target [tty] [enable/disable] [rate] [bits] [parity] [stop]

Enables the display of any data received from the target on a connected 
jtag interface (in this case the flyswatter) [tty] is for hypothetical 
devices which could have multiple serial ports on them, and would be 
0,1,2, etc. [rate], etc is only valid for an enable.

Data from the target would then be shown as:
target 0: [data]

 &gt; target_cmd [tty] [data]

Data is sent verbatim, minus the first space after tty, over the serial 
line nominated through the jtag interface.

Its for text work, it isn't intended to transfer files and such.  I am 
thinking of interacting with boot loaders, seeing debug messages and the 
like.

The commands are independent.  The target tty could be disabled (its 
still set up, just not being displayed) which just means output from the 
target is suppressed, but target_cmd would still try and send data to 
the target.

Or something like that.
