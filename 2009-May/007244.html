</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe I misunderstood.  I thought we were deprecating the use of  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;u32&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in favor of the C99-defined &quot;uint32_t&quot;.  Why would we define another

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> part of the language standard?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Heh.  I just went back and re-read the original post and realized my
</I>&gt;<i> mistake; however, I will defend my changes with two principles:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) It's shorter/faster to type.  This argument has been hashed out
</I>&gt;<i> extensively on the Linux mailing lists.  Linus has it right in this
</I>&gt;<i> debate to prefer s32/u32.  POSIX is dumb; however, that doesn't mean  
</I>&gt;<i> we
</I>&gt;<i> can't exploit their work for own purposes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Perhaps I'm jaded from writing code for OS X where function names are  
intended to be descriptive and thus end up long.  Most editors include  
autocompletion which makes the difference minimal in practice.  Even  
when I'm writing code in vi, I prefer the longer type names since it  
make it clear that a) it's a type by having the _t suffix and b)  
that's an unsigned int.  With u32, there are plenty of cases where odd  
naming collisions can occur.  It's also not clear that its an integer,  
but just an unsigned 32-bit something.  To be entirely honest, I  
prefer seeing long, descriptive function prototypes like:

status_t TriggerSetThreadStateFilter(trigger_t trigger, const  
thread_state_t * stateMasks, uint32_t numberOfStateMasks, error_t *  
error);

I pulled this particular example from another project I'm working on,  
but it should illustrate the point.  You can understand what most of  
the parameters are and have a decent idea of what the function does.   
The compiler doesn't care about names, so we should optimize them for  
the people.

&gt;<i> 2) More importantly, this patch applies the principle of least change.
</I>&gt;<i> These changes both unify the type system around the types that are
</I>&gt;<i> defined in &quot;types.h&quot; (and with the Linux kernel).  Thus, we achieve
</I>&gt;<i> conformance to an internal (and external) standard that we can enforce
</I>&gt;<i> from here on.  With less typing (this goes both for the types  
</I>&gt;<i> themselves
</I>&gt;<i> and for the changes necessary to convert the entire tree to use the
</I>&gt;<i> types that are used in only a handful of files today).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Given that the state of the code is a hodgepodge of various naming  
conventions, I don't see it being a good source for &quot;it was mostly  
that way already&quot;.  I'd rather we chose a sensible convention based on  
merits and apply it wholesale rather than just letting majority rule.

Having the types align with the Linux kernel is of effectively no  
importance.  I happen to do all my development on OS X which follows  
the C99 naming standards for anything in the BSD layer.  Familiarity  
in this case doesn't hold across the gamut of our developer base.

&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i>

&quot;He said he hadn't had a byte in three days. I had a short, so I split  
it with him.&quot;
