&quot;Retry&quot;?

I'd rather see the event loops structured better, so that each activity
gets its own thread.  That would move from those error-prone presumptions
that manually timesliced event loops can scale.

I see messages about needing to increase some GDB timeout/interval.  But
that's foolishness, since I'm not even working with GDB when they start
spamming me.  The core problem has nothing to do with GDB, and everything
to do with a weak concurrency model.

Too bad that can't be fixed before the next release.  ;)
