Hmm, I was hoping to send a new NAND driver now that it's
basically working ... and some updated board support ...

The earliest proposal I'd heard for a &quot;freeze&quot; was Zach's
mentioning of wanting to see one about a week from last
weekend ... no particular response, but I was aiming to
get this stuff mergeable ASAP.

Worth IMO drawing a distinction between &quot;core&quot; support
and the rest.  One thing that Linux does is recognize
that new drivers can't cause regressions ... so that
they can safely be added later in the release cycle.
While a very strict policy would say &quot;new driver&quot; is
a kind of &quot;new feature&quot;, it can also be viewed as a
flavor of bugfix -- &lt;hardware X&gt; didn't work before.

So I'd agree it's certainly time to work on stability
for the core, no new features/functionality.  But that
should leave the door open to other bits, IMO.

Especially since work on those other bits has been
stalled, off and on, by core stability issues.  ;)
