<PRE>The following are some notes I put together about the &quot;nand&quot;
commands based on reading the source code.

I plan to turn them into documentation sometime later, maybe by this
time next week.  I've seen no documentation on the NAND commands; that
seems like a significant omission.

Meanwhile I thought I'd send them around for comments and corrections.

The &quot;==&gt;&quot; comments are things which seem like they deserve some action
other than documenting the current status.  One example is removing (or
at least disabling) the &quot;nand copy&quot; command until it gets implemented.

- Dave




NAND COMMANDS
=============

At this writing:

  - Only NAND devices with 512 or 2048 byte pages are handled
    properly.  Older devices with 256 byte pages are rejected.

    	==&gt; Erm, aren't chips with 4K pages mis-handled?
	At least in some paths.

  - ECC codes can be generated when pages are written, but are not
    used to correct errors when data is read ... unless maybe
    the underlying driver has a read_page() method which does so.

  - Writing a file to NAND, or reading it from NAND, ignores
    bad block markers.

    	==&gt; Worth fixing, yes??  Just skipping bad blocks
	would match one common usage.  If not, then at least
	report errors instead of writing there...

  - Every NAND device is associated with a target.

    	==&gt; Hmm, so maybe that target should be stored in the
	NAND device instead of the controller-private data.
	And the lookup should be done by the NAND core not
	the individual drivers.  Or ... should the syntax be
	&quot;TARGET nand ...&quot; since the drivers are generally
	SoC-specific?

  - Nothing verifies that pages are erased before writing.

    	==&gt; Is that the same as NOR flash does?

The way to use these starts with:

	nand device CONTROLLER TARGET [controller-options]
		... to declare each NAND chip.  For chips with two
		halves (e.g. a 2 GByte chip with two 1GB halves),
		declare each half separately.
	nand info
		... to see what number it was given
	nand probe NUM
		... to see what sort of chip is there 


Then you can use &quot;write&quot; to transfer data from a file to the NAND
chip, or &quot;dump&quot; to go the other direction.

Configuration
-------------

nand device CONTROLLER TARGET [controller-options]
	There are several built-in controllers, some of which have
	controller-specific options or controller-specific commands.
	This *must* go into a config/init script.

	&quot;lpc3180&quot;
	 - extra parameter: clock frequency
	 - special command: lpc3180 select NUM [mlc|slc]
	     There are two NAND controllers, one for SLC chips and
	     the other for MLC.  If a parameter is given, it selects
	     that controller.  The currently selected controller is
	     displayed unless there is an error.
	 - MLC controller seems to use hardware ECC logic... ?

	&quot;orion&quot;
	 - extra parameter: address for the NAND chip
	 - no special commands

	&quot;s3c2410&quot;
	&quot;s3c2412&quot;
	&quot;s3c2440&quot;
	&quot;s3c2443&quot;
	 - no extra parameters
	 - no special commands

nand list
	Prints a one-line summary of each device found, numbered
	from zero.  Note that un-probed devices show no details.

nand probe NUM
	Probes the specified device to determine key characteristics
	including size, manufacturer, page size, and erase size

Basic I/O
---------

nand dump NUM filename offset length [oob_raw|oob_only]
	Reads binary data from the NAND chip and writes it to the file,
	starting at the specified offset.

	The offset and length must be an exact multiple of the chip's
	page size.

	No error correction is done on the data that's read, unless the
	controller has a read_page() which does that transparently.

	By default, only page data is saved to the specified file.  Two
	options allow the OOB data to be saved:

	- oob_raw ... output file interleaves data and OOB data.

	- oob_only ... output file has only raw OOB data.

nand erase NUM block_first block_last
	Erases blocks from first to last (inclusive), excepting
	bad blocks.  Checks for bad blocks first, if needed. 

nand write NUM filename offset [oob_raw|oob_only|oob_softecc|oob_softecc_kw]*
	Writes binary data from the file into the specified NAND chip,
	starting at the specified offset.  Those pages should already
	have been erased.

	The offset must be an exact multiple of the chip's page size.
	Only full pages are written, and any extra space on the last
	page will be filled with 0xff bytes.  (That includes OOB data,
	if oob_raw is used.)

	Unless one or more of the optional oob_* parameters is provided,
	no OOB data is written.  Provide only one oob_* paramater.

		==&gt; No error currently reported if conflicting
		params are provided... fix?

	- no oob_* parameter ... file has only page data, which is
	  written.  Each page's OOB area stays untouched, unless
	  the underlying driver has a write_page routine that updates
	  it (perhaps to hold hardware-computed ECC data) which is
	  used to write each page.

	- oob_raw ... file interleaves data and OOB data, both of which
	  are written (in that order).

	- oob_only ... file has only raw OOB data, which is written to
	  the OOB area.  Each page's data area stays untouched.

	- oob_softecc ... file has only page data, which is written.
	  The OOB area is filled with 0xff, except for a standard 1-bit
	  software ECC code stored in conventional locations (for 512
	  or 2048 byte pages).

	- oob_softecc_kw ... file has data, which is written.  The OOB
	  area is filled with 0xff, except for a 4-bit software ECC used
	  specific to the boot ROM in Marvell Kirkwood SoCs.


Other
-----

nand info NUM
	Prints the one-line summary from &quot;nand list&quot;, and if the
	device has been probed also prints the status of each block
	(if known):  erased/not/unknown, good/bad/unknown

nand check_bad_blocks NUM [block_first block_last]
	Scans for bad blocks if needed, from first to last (inclusive).
	If no parameters are provided, all blocks are scanned.

nand copy NUM offset length ram_addr
	==&gt; NOT IMPLEMENTED -- DISABLE AND DO NOT DOCUMENT

nand raw_access NUM &lt;enable|disable&gt;
	Sets or clears an flag affecting how page I/O is done.

	By default, if the underlying controller driver provides a
	read_page() that is used when dumping data to a file or when
	scanning for bad blocks.  Similarly, if it provides write_page()
	that is used when writing file data to the chip.

	Setting this flag makes those operations ignore those two
	methods, when they exist.  This might cause slower performance,
	or bypass hardware ECC logic.
