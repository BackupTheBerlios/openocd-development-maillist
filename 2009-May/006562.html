I just made mine public, added my skills, and put up my CV.  I hope the
other maintainers will take my lead and follow suit.

As for my role here, I appear to be herding the cats, keeping the peace,
and otherwise playing a project management role.  While I am not sure
that I like how the shoe fits, I seem to be wearing it.  Surprisingly,
this seems to be going over fairly well with the community, though I
state this merely as a hypothesis rather than as a matter of fact.

I would just assume keep my head down and write code, so I really hope
that any need for me in such a role will be temporary.  My work schedule
may mean my time here will be limited anyway.  I will know in two weeks
whether my last contract will be extended; if not, I must find work that
will pay my salary.

Otherwise, I am just a dude who contributes some minor patches.

&gt;<i> Rick's comments the other day (re the 0.1 release) seemed rather
</I>&gt;<i> informative to me..

Indeed.  They helped spur me into trying to help drive things forward.
When the release manager expresses frustration, things are kaput.

One point to make here is the conflicting desires of a &quot;release manager&quot;
and &quot;developers&quot;.  At their extremes, the former would have us making
stable releases every night, while the later would have us working madly
on the trunk (and to heck with releases).  We must find a happy medium
so both processes can flow smoothly.  Mostly, this means empowering that
individual to lead the decision to release and having the rest of the
maintainers comply with the restrictions thusly imposed (merge windows).

Cheers,

Zach
