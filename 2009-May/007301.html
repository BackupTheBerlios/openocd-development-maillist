<PRE>zach&gt;
&gt;<i> Sorry Rick, but I think that you and Duane have lost this argument.
</I>&gt;<i> You have failed to defend your position with facts.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
It's hard to 'defined my position' - when I asked this last night 9pm - 
and left early this AM to spend a good part of memorial day holiday on a 
sail boat (what a Beautiful day where I am)  meanwhile, the discussion 
went on.

I was asking more for an opinion, and the *REASON* I wanted to ask this 
was the recent rash of  &quot;printf()&quot; formatter warning fixes, etc - and 
how this mess plays out over different host platform, arches, etc.

ie:  &quot;u32&quot; can be created a &quot;zillion ways&quot; on some platforms, however - 
to stop 'printf' warnings one should perform &quot;X&quot; - what ever that is - 
and that step is a noble goal in it self.  I thought - perhaps wrongly - 
that somebody could point me at something that says the &quot;portable cross 
platform c99 way of printing a &quot;uint&lt;whatever&gt;_t&quot; would be specifier &quot;X&quot; 
or something like that.

If that did exist, then yes there is a technical reason that method X is 
better then Y, and that technical reason wins.

David's statement:  &quot;they look and smell long, like an elephant&quot; - while 
funny, I agree with him 100%, that view has no technical component.

And to day - zach - you are correct when you say:

 &gt;&gt; In this case, the shorthand types are the de facto standard, based on
 &gt;&gt; the majority of lines of code that use them. They have already won.

That is however, the &quot;we always do it that way&quot; answer.

Understand, I am asking the &quot;pot roast question&quot; there's another version 
using &quot;a baked ham&quot;
