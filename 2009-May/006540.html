&gt;<i>   Hello all:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   I have noticed some issues on CFI flash driver related to chip and bus width  
</I>&gt;<i> affecting read and writes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   The system I'm dealing with is based on a Vitesse switch chip which embeds 
</I>&gt;<i> an ARM926ejs processor. It additionally provides RAM and flash controller. In 
</I>&gt;<i> this case we are using an spansion S29GL128 16MB flash chip, using a 8bit width 
</I>&gt;<i> data bus layout, so on each read/write cycle we can only retrieve 1byte at 
</I>&gt;<i> once. The flash chip data bus width is 16bit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I declare the flash like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> flash bank cfi 0x80000000 0x1000000 1 2 0
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>You mean you have *two* of those flash chips, each connected to one
8-bit half of the 16-bit bus?
&gt;<i> =&gt; 1st problem (writing):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   This clashes somehow with the current CFI driver operations as designed now. 
</I>&gt;<i> I have discovered that when the connected flash is 8 bit, only byte writes will 
</I>&gt;<i> be performed correctly so even this call:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   target-&gt;type-&gt;write_memory(target, address, 4, 1, value_buf)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> will succeed, the operation isn't carried out correctly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   I got to workaround the problem for just cfi flash probe. See attached cfi-
</I>&gt;<i> write-width.diff What I do there is using chip width instead of bus width for 
</I>&gt;<i> each write. This works in my case but I'm not sure it's the general way to go.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   This effect expands to larger write operations, for instance in 
</I>&gt;<i> target_write_u32 (cfi.c:1220) you would need to repeat a byte write operation 4 
</I>&gt;<i> times.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; 2nd problem (reading)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   But writing is not the only problem. In reading, when chip width is 8bit 
</I>&gt;<i> whereas bus width is 16bit, single byte operation could 	be acceptable, 
</I>&gt;<i> whereas this is no longer valid for halfword or word operations, 16bit and 
</I>&gt;<i> 32bit, respectively. When you call, for example cfi_query_u16, expected return 
</I>&gt;<i> is 0xAABB, where 0xAA is the MSB and 0xBB is the LSB. Current return is always 
</I>&gt;<i> 0xBBBB. Similar problem for cfi_query_u32
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   The solution is iterating the necessary times for a 1byte read and then 
</I>&gt;<i> aggregate each iteration result properly. See attached cfi-read_iteration.diff
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>In general, I don't think this is the right approach. When you have
multiple chips in parallel to make up the data bus width (like 2 8-bit
flashs on a 16-bit bus), you can only expect 16-bit read/write
operations to work. For one, some CPUs don't have separate write enables
for the separate 8-bit parts of the bus, and even if they do, a read may
always assert all byte enables and discard the &quot;unused&quot; parts.

I think the only thing that works in general is to only make bus-width
sized accesses - ie. 16-bit in case of two 8-bit flashs, which means you
have to read/write both chips in parallel.
&gt;<i>   I guess the x16_as_x8 option defined but not used should be aimed at handling 
</I>&gt;<i> this, but this is unimplemented currently.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Um - no. The x16_as_x8 option is used for 16-bit flashes that can be
used with an 8-bit data bus. The reason for that option is that in that
mode, the &quot;magic&quot; address values used for commands is shifted 1 bit
against what is used on &quot;real&quot; 8-bit flashs. The option should only tell
that a 16-bit flash chip is connected to a 8-bit bus - having multiple
such chips in parallel must be handled by the chip/bus geometry handling.

You might have a look at the CFI code in u-boot, which I *think* does
handle this situation correct, however, I have no board with such a
flash layout, so I can't really tell.
