The process for stabilizing hasn't been well defined, so let me  
explain the process I've been following for the last few rounds of  
patches as well as what I use for my day job.  I use risk vs reward  
along with the level of testing and time in the release cycle to  
determine if a path should be applied.

For risk, I use the following criteria:

None - Every change has risk.  This is never used.
Low - The changes either affect a small portion of the code base, are  
very small but repetitious throughout the code base, or are entirely  
mechanical in nature (running the code through a script)
Medium - The changes affect more than one component in the code base,  
are medium-sized but repetitious, or change the semantics or output of  
an infrequently used command
High - The changes affect 3 or more components in the code base,  
affect a core subsystem, are large but repetitious, change the  
semantics or output of any frequently used command, or may cause any  
sort of overall instability (crash, hang, etc)

For reward, I use the following:

None - No actual impact to a typical user.  These are things like  
changes to maintainer scripts, developer docs, etc.
Low - Resolved issue affects a small portion of users, has only minor  
impact on a medium to large size user base (fixing typos, changing  
error message, etc), or provides minor improvement to ancillary  
installed items (documentation, helper scripts, contrib items)
Medium - Resolved issue affects a medium-sized portion of the users or  
provides major improvement to ancillary installed items (docs,  
scripts, contrib items)
High - Resolved issue affects a large portion of users or solves an  
overall instability issue (crash, hang, etc)

After that, the decision process moves along a sliding scale based on  
time left until release:

2 weeks before release - Must be medium or high reward with low risk.   
Must be tested on multiple interfaces and targets if appropriate.
4 weeks before release - Must be medium or high reward with low or  
medium risk.  Must be tested on at least one interface and multiple  
targets if appropriate.
8 weeks before release - Any reward with low or medium risk.  Testing  
highly preferred but not explicitly required.
Over 8 weeks before release - Any well written patch will generally be  
accepted.

These criteria are just guidelines to help patch authors understand  
what will be allowed when and to help maintainers decide which patches  
to apply.  Of course, special circumstances can and do happen.  If  
there is a patch that doesn't meet the criteria above but there is a  
good reason it should be applied for the release, the patch and the  
justification should be sent to the list for feedback from the  
community.  If in doubt, send it to the list.

If a patch is rejected solely because of the timing within the release  
cycle, it should be held and resubmitted once the current release is  
finished.  If the patch is rejected for any other reason, it should be  
reevaluated after any requested changes have been made.  You never  
know if a 10000 patch might have portions meet the criteria once it is  
broken up into smaller, logical chunks.

I'm also open to suggestions on how to improve this process through  
both adjustments to the process and usage of tools.  My day job uses a  
specialized issue tracking tool that help facilitate this process and  
ensures that no submitted patches are lost even if they are rejected  
for the current release.  Something similar could be useful.

So, the introduction of a new NAND driver would probably fall into the  
Low risk and Low/Medium reward area.  Given our hope to release by  
7/1, we have a little over 5 weeks.  I'd prefer it have some testing,  
but I'd likely apply the patch today. In another week, I'd be less  
likely to take such a change unless a significant amount of testing  
was done and the change in question is useful to a decent number of  
users.
