Per my previous emails, my life is a bit busy for the next few  
months.  As such, I can't really be guaranteed to do the day-to-day  
patch review process or handle every commit to the branches, but I can  
definitely chime in on process, occasional patch reviews, etc.

To get started on a 0.2.0, we really need to pin down all the open  
issues in trunk.  I'm not referring to open issues as in &quot;anything  
that is broken&quot;, but things that are currently in development in some  
form in trunk.  The List should certainly help in this regard.  We  
need to break The List into two pieces: the things currently in trunk  
and everything else.  Once we start the road to 0.2.0, anything in  
progress in trunk needs to either be finished or stubbed out for end  
users.  Anything in the &quot;everything else&quot; category needs to _not be  
introduced_ into trunk until _after_ a 0.2.0 branch has been cut.   
Even then, I'd prefer that it be delayed until 0.2.0 is mostly ready  
so patches to trunk can easy be ported to the 0.2.0 branch.  Note that  
I'm not advocating completely stopping development of trunk, but  
rather a temporary pause to stabilize enough that we can cut a 0.2.0  
branch.  After we do that, only small, directed fixes will go into  
that branch while trunk can be open for small to medium changes.

I'm specifically going to ignore any discussion of setting a specific  
release date or schedule.  While I would like to have 0.2.0 wrapped by  
7/1 (1/7 for the parts of the world that prefer sensible date  
formats), given the nature of open-source and the infrequency of  
contributions, any such hard date would be relatively meaningless.   
Instead, I'll just send more and more emails as we approach that rough  
estimate.

Past history has shown that having action items tends to motivate  
people to provide data _after_ emails/meetings.

Zach - Can you separate The List to items in progress and things not  
started?
Cortex-A8 crowd - Estimate time to implement full Cortex-A8 support.   
If &gt;2 weeks, plan to hold that work until after 0.2.0
Anyone with an in progress item - Estimate time to finish.  Wild  
guesses are fine.  Not going to hold you to it.

it with him.&quot;
