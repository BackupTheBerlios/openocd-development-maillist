<PRE>Hi all,

I want everyone to know The List has hit the repository in r1791.
It has evolved beyond my ability to manage it without some help.

There has been so much activity lately that I know some things may have
slipped through the cracks.  At this point, the amount of time it will
take me to find all of them is more than I can spare, though I still
have been adding and updating tasks when they come to my attention.

I have recently started to track List items back to the messages that
originated them, when such are necessary to pick up critical details
required to complete them.  I think that these links catapult The List
beyond a mere TODO or task list.  It has started to provide references
to explain how the items got there in the first place, and I would like
to see it grow further into a means of outlining the progress of
features that are in The Works.

As a result, I have started working to integrate it with the doxygen
manual, allowing the tasks to reference (and link to) the relevant
sections of the code directly.  Once there, I would like the community
to provide patches to provide mailing list reference links to associate
with the remaining task items (if possible), as well as generally help
me bring it completely up-to-date.  I cannot afford to do all of that
work myself, but the community should be able to make short order of it.

I will continue maintaining The List in the repository through periodic
batch updates, but I wanted to make it possible for others to directly
contribute to a recent version at any time.

Cheers,

Zach
