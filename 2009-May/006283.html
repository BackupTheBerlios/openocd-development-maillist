I'd rather we stop that from happening.  It sidesteps the community  
review process, introduces more risk to trunk, and means we get long,  
heated arguments about the changes rather the discussion.  The list  
should be a clearinghouse.  A lack of comment shouldn't imply consent.

&gt;<i> Or would that belong in a separate &quot;process&quot; document?

It's not appropriate for the PATCHES file per se, but we should  
formalize the process for _after_ a patch has been sent to the list.   
That is mainly for maintainers to reference and for submitters to  
understand what is happening.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
My main concern is that I can save the patch to disk without my mail  
client mangling it and that I can apply it with a simple command.  If  
there is a chance it ends up being -p1 instead of -p0, I don't really  
care.  I just want a text file that generates patch-compatible diffs  
as an attachment to the email.

Of course, that's just my opinion.  As everything else in this  
project, we should do what the community wants.

it with him.&quot;
