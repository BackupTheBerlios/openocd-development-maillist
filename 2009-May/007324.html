<PRE>Xiaofan Chen a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> 2009/5/25 Michel Catudal &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">michelcatudal at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Within theses chips and ColdFire, Infineon XE166 does not seem to have gcc
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> support.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Incorrect, I have one, do you need it? I could provide some binaries on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my web site if I have space left.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It is about two years old, I am trying to get the lastest source but am
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> having some problem with the company who so far
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has refused to abide by the GPL. They did provide me with the source a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> couple of years ago.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I may look into updating the new sources myself but this is not my top
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> priority at the moment.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Which version would you need? I have Mandriva 2009.0, Fedora 9, SuSE
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 11.1 and Ubuntu 8.10 systems.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Source codes and build instructions are the best. If not, Ubuntu will be
</I>&gt;<i> good since that is my main distro (now 9.04/8.10). I also use Fedora 10.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Then Fedora 9 should work for you if my Ubuntu script is not complete 
for that. I know it will compile on Fedora 9 but not sure yet on Ubuntu.
I will have the binary and source by week end.
This would be the two year old version as I haven't been successfull 
into getting the latest source yet.
The funny part about the company in question, they have recently bought 
part of a company that my employer had outsourced to a few years ago.
The beauty of outsourcing ... I spent over a month fixing the mess as we 
were about to lose a multi million dollars contract. When the customer
found out that I was again in charge they calmed down.
Last week when we discussed the different compilers for infineon we had 
a good laugh when I noticed that.

&gt;&gt;<i> I do have GCC for Renesas as well. If someone needs it I would need to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recompile it under the new systems.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Last I worked with it was with Fedora 8. I do have the latest source for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Renesas.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, Source codes and build instructions are the best. If not, Ubuntu will be
</I>&gt;<i> good since that is my main distro (now 9.04/8.10). I also use Fedora 10
</I>&gt;<i> and Arch Linux (testing purpose only).
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I may have this one done by next week but not certain. Before I put it 
up I have to make sure the package compiles good. I don't have a script made
for Ubuntu but I should be able to adapt my arm script for it. The 
difference for compilation are minor. Do you need C++ or not?

I have been using SuSE 11.1 for a while but all of a sudden my mouse 
double click no longer work after an update so for now most of
my work is on Fedora 9. I will install Fedora 11 shortly. I have 
installed Ubuntu out of curiosity and so I can support systems where I 
install Ubuntu,
but I am not impressed, Redhat is superior and packaging creation is not 
as much a pain as it with Ubuntu. I usually prefer to install Ubuntu for 
people
in the family who don't know anything about Linux as it presents me less 
work but for my own use, no way.

Tired of Microsoft's rebootive multitasking?
then it's time to upgrade to Linux.
