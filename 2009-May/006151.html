<PRE>Oyvind&gt;   [removed some non-used api features of the JTAG field structures]

Laurent&gt; [please put them back, they are important]

Laurent,

You are the only one who wants this to remain.

Your request to keep these items sound like a idea that somebody 
_thought_ was important, but it turned out they where wrong and it was 
really never needed.

Please - offer

(1) a technical requirement where this is required today, or
(2) a technical requirement describing a &quot;work-in-process&quot; that needs 
this that is &quot;in process&quot; now, or
(3) where this stops some 'very near *real* feature', ie: the next step 
of something.

There is a phrase I know as being a 'pack rat' - in some ways - you need 
to throw away something you do not use, otherwise, it just gets in your 
way - and clutters the entire place up.

I could go on - to many places.  For example - why is the function:   
&quot;cortex_m3_poll()&quot; - a public function - in a public header file? I can 
offer no valid explanation what so ever but yet it exists as a public 
API.  Should we keep that API - just because something might use it?

It comes down to a &quot;many-to-many&quot; relationship problem a bad thing.

The famous writer Hemingway had a specific style: dispense with the 
flowery stuff - and be minimalist. The core of the story, procedure, 
function, package, what's really important.

The other phrase I know is this: You eat an elephant - one byte at a time.

We all may differ about where to start on eating the elephant - in the 
end, if every step is a monotonic step towards devouring that elephant - 
every step is a good step.

-Duane.
