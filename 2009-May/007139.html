OK, that makes sense. default reset info in the cpu.cfg, possibly
overridden in the board.cfg and then again in the top-level
bring-it-all-together.cfg

&gt;<i> Reset handling does seem conceptually messy though 
</I>
So far as I can see that's intrinsic, rather than anything openocd can
fix. 

... and that's
&gt;<i> in addition to what seem like current bugs.  At least some of

Hmm, you mean something could declare that it doesn't pass/expose
signals. That would fit reality better. On the other hand it would
mean the reset config was now defined as the concatenation of commands
in various places and that might make it hard to find out what was
going on in some circs. 

Worth thinking about though.
