Most of us do, yes.  Although there are other dimensions
that also come into play.


&gt;<i> For risk, I use the following criteria:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> None - Every change has risk.  This is never used.
</I>&gt;<i> Low - The changes either affect a small portion of the code base, are  
</I>&gt;<i> very small but repetitious throughout the code base, or are entirely  
</I>&gt;<i> mechanical in nature (running the code through a script)
</I>&gt;<i> Medium - The changes affect more than one component in the code base,  
</I>&gt;<i> are medium-sized but repetitious, or change the semantics or output of  
</I>&gt;<i> an infrequently used command
</I>&gt;<i> High - The changes affect 3 or more components in the code base,  
</I>&gt;<i> affect a core subsystem, are large but repetitious, change the  
</I>&gt;<i> semantics or output of any frequently used command, or may cause any  
</I>&gt;<i> sort of overall instability (crash, hang, etc)
</I>
Low/medium/high is fair enough, though it's often not
easy to quantify.

 
&gt;<i> For reward, I use the following:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> None - No actual impact to a typical user.  These are things like  
</I>&gt;<i> changes to maintainer scripts, developer docs, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> Low - Resolved issue affects a small portion of users, has only minor  
</I>&gt;<i> impact on a medium to large size user base (fixing typos, changing  
</I>&gt;<i> error message, etc), or provides minor improvement to ancillary  
</I>&gt;<i> installed items (documentation, helper scripts, contrib items)
</I>&gt;<i> Medium - Resolved issue affects a medium-sized portion of the users or  
</I>&gt;<i> provides major improvement to ancillary installed items (docs,  
</I>&gt;<i> scripts, contrib items)
</I>&gt;<i> High - Resolved issue affects a large portion of users or solves an  
</I>&gt;<i> overall instability issue (crash, hang, etc)
</I>
Likewise, often hard to quantify.  Talking about a &quot;typical&quot; user
always raises my suspicions; there are all sizes and shapes.

Might be worth thinking about a few different categories for now
though.  Maybe &quot;GDB user&quot; that wants to debug embedded no-MMU
microcontroller code; &quot;Bootloader developer&quot; who's basically
focussed on getting U-Boot into flash or de-bricking, working
with new boards (or updating older ones); and so on.

Unblocking some types of users can broaden the user community.
Some of those users, in short, are &quot;potential&quot;.  And one of
the goals of new releases is to grow that user community.  ;)


&gt;<i> After that, the decision process moves along a sliding scale based on  
</I>&gt;<i> time left until release:
</I>
This implies some things about release schedule and process...

 
&gt;<i> 2 weeks before release - Must be medium or high reward with low risk.   
</I>&gt;<i> Must be tested on multiple interfaces and targets if appropriate.
</I>
&gt;<i> 4 weeks before release - Must be medium or high reward with low or  
</I>&gt;<i> medium risk.  Must be tested on at least one interface and multiple  
</I>&gt;<i> targets if appropriate.
</I>
I think we're probably now closer to &quot;4 weeks&quot; than &quot;2&quot;.

Another dimension being:  developers during that part of the
cycle need to focus on finding and fixing bugs.


&gt;<i> 8 weeks before release - Any reward with low or medium risk.  Testing  
</I>&gt;<i> highly preferred but not explicitly required.
</I>
&gt;<i> Over 8 weeks before release - Any well written patch will generally be  
</I>&gt;<i> accepted.
</I>
Best if things *always* require testing, IMO, even if only
from the original developer.  :)


&gt;<i> These criteria are just guidelines to help patch authors understand  
</I>&gt;<i> what will be allowed when and to help maintainers decide which patches  
</I>&gt;<i> to apply.  Of course, special circumstances can and do happen.  If  
</I>&gt;<i> there is a patch that doesn't meet the criteria above but there is a  
</I>&gt;<i> good reason it should be applied for the release, the patch and the  
</I>&gt;<i> justification should be sent to the list for feedback from the  
</I>&gt;<i> community.  If in doubt, send it to the list.
</I>
Yes.


&gt;<i> If a patch is rejected solely because of the timing within the release  
</I>&gt;<i> cycle, it should be held and resubmitted once the current release is  
</I>&gt;<i> finished.
</I>
Resubmitting being the responsibility of the initial developer,
as with all resubmission (including &quot;split this up&quot;, &quot;please
fix this problem&quot;, etc).

Stuff like &quot;quilt&quot; makes it easy to maintain a series of patches
on top of whatever SCM is involved, note.


&gt;<i> If the patch is rejected for any other reason, it should be   
</I>&gt;<i> reevaluated after any requested changes have been made.  You never  
</I>&gt;<i> know if a 10000 patch might have portions meet the criteria once it is  
</I>&gt;<i> broken up into smaller, logical chunks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm also open to suggestions on how to improve this process through  
</I>&gt;<i> both adjustments to the process and usage of tools.  My day job uses a  
</I>&gt;<i> specialized issue tracking tool that help facilitate this process and  
</I>&gt;<i> ensures that no submitted patches are lost even if they are rejected  
</I>&gt;<i> for the current release.  Something similar could be useful.
</I>
Maybe, but I've observed that Free Software developers are
no happier with following rules (even sane ones!) than any
other developers.

In the end it boils down to *people* doing the right things
and working with each other.


&gt;<i> So, the introduction of a new NAND driver would probably fall into the  
</I>&gt;<i> Low risk and Low/Medium reward area.
</I>
Right ... although, to affected users it would be &quot;high reward&quot;,
while it would remain low risk to everyone.


&gt;<i>  Given our hope to release by 7/1, we have a little over 5 weeks. 
</I>
I don't know where 7/1 came from.  I had thought &quot;sooner&quot;
was in the air...


&gt;<i> I'd prefer it have some testing,   
</I>&gt;<i> but I'd likely apply the patch today. In another week, I'd be less  
</I>&gt;<i> likely to take such a change unless a significant amount of testing  
</I>&gt;<i> was done and the change in question is useful to a decent number of  
</I>&gt;<i> users.
</I>
Hmm, that's what I was getting at by pointing out the way
Linux has an &quot;exception&quot; for new drivers.  The logic is
that when it's such a low risk all around, the fact that
it's a *very* high reward for a small set of &quot;new&quot; users
trumps the fact that the larger set of &quot;old&quot; users won't
even notice it.

That said, it seems like I'll be sending that patch along
very soon, and quite a few modes will have been tested.
