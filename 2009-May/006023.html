Excellent.  I can push the autotools in this direction too.

Does anyone else here consider themselves responsible for OpenOCD's
autotools support, or should I just help myself and take charge?

I will eventually need to produce a MinGW32 build myself as well, but I
have done that with autotools in the past.

I think this shows that CMake deserves to be put in ASAP.  It will have
commercial support, and it does not get much better than that.

Cheers,

Zach
