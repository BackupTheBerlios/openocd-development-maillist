<PRE>Main difference is the startup sequence.
You can check &quot;Programming a Flash-Based MSP430 Using the JTAG Interface&quot; 
from TI, file name of which is slaa149f.pdf.

I capture the picture about the difference, see attachment.

3.1.2 Fuse Check and Reset of the JTAG State Machine (TAP Controller)
Memory Programming Control Sequences
Reference functions: ResetTAP, ResetTAP_sbw
Each MSP430 family device includes a physical fuse used to permanently disable memory access via
JTAG communication. When this fuse is programmed (or blown), access to memory via JTAG is
permanently disabled and cannot be restored. When initializing JTAG access after power up, a fuse check
must be done before JTAG access is granted. Toggling of the TMS signal twice performs the check.
While the fuse is tested, a current of up to 2 mA flows into the TDI input (or into the TEST pin on devices
without dedicated JTAG pins). To enable settling of the current, the low phase of the two TMS pulses
should last a minimum of 5 &#956; s.
Under certain circumstances (e.g., plugging in a battery), a toggling of TMS may accidentally occur while
TDI is logical low. In that case, no current flows through the security fuse, but the internal logic remembers
that a fuse check was performed. Thus, the fuse is mistakenly recognized as programmed (e.g., blown).
To avoid the issue, newer MSP430 JTAG implementations also reset the internal fuse-check logic on
performing a reset of the TAP controller. Thus, it is recommended to first perform a reset of the TAP and
then check the JTAG fuse status as shown in Figure 12 . To perform a reset of the TAP controller it is
recommended that a minimum of six TCK clocks be sent to the target device while TMS is high followed
by setting TMS low for at least one TCK clock. This sets the JTAG state machine (TAP controller) to a
defined starting point: the Run-Test/Idle state. This procedure can also be used at any time during JTAG
communication to reset the JTAG port.

</I>Could you summarize how msp430 is non-standard?
I know that msp430 -- as well as the C200 microcontrollers -- can
be programmed using an ft2232c based &quot;XDS100&quot; [1] adapter.  Which is
certainly self-described as a JTAG adapter ... albeit one that
also controls the EMU0 and EMU1 outputs that TI likes.
So I'd kind of thought that any differences between MSP430 and
other JTAGs are more at the level of minor goofage than anything
very significant.  Like maybe problems co-existing on standard
JTAG scan chains.
