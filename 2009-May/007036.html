<PRE>Hey Duane,

</I>&gt;<i> it's comments, a step in the right direction!.
</I>It looks like the biggest issue is that some of those comment blocks are 
not Doxygen blocks.  They need to start with '/**' to be picked up.  
Your patch brings up another question: Do we want documentation done 
with \param (Doxygen &quot;style&quot;) or @param (more like Javadoc).  A lot of 
the patches I have put through use the Javadoc style cause I use that at 
work all the time in my Java career :).  I would also suggest not 
putting the function documentation on the same line as the '/**'.  
Starting on the next line leads to a more boxed effect.

I suppose this raises another question about what to do with 
documentation standards along with coding standards.  I have no major 
preference though I think the Javadoc ones are easier to type (ah, my 
Perl days) and looks a bit nicer.  Plus, the @ style is used in phpdoc 
too so it might be good to stick with a &quot;standard&quot;.  In the end, Doxygen 
understands both, so its not a big issue.  My 2 cents.  Thanks for 
providing docs.
