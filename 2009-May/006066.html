It doesn't appear to me that you have read the whole discussion. I think
the response was quite appropriate, the project has some issues because
it is not
complete yet, it is work in progress. To claim that the project is trash
is a bit offensive to many of us who think highly of the OpenOCD project.

Some people are more full of themselves than they should be. At the
price the contributors on this project are paid I think that it is
uncalled for to call any on them
unqualified. Each person who provide code that works have a right to be
respected. I find some coding would need improvement but to qualify this
as crap is
stupid.

What is interesting about an opensource project is that you work on it
for fun, not because some jerk manager is up your ass to get the work
done two months earlier than
it is possible to do so. We find some reward in doing code that works
for people.
