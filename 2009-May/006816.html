<PRE>I now have working openOCD with Olimex and Amontec USB based dongles. 
It would be nice to get our old parallel port dongles working too so
that I can throw away a lot of legacy code (jflash and bflash (which
was an attempt to do something with similar flexibility to openOCD but
only addressed boundary-scan)), and use openOCD for everything.

However. Parallel port dongles like the xilinx-alike DLC5 and the
LART/JTUX adaptor (both listed here:
<A HREF="http://www.balloonboard.org/balloonwiki/BalloonJTAGing">http://www.balloonboard.org/balloonwiki/BalloonJTAGing</A> )
are very dim and don't control the reset lines themselves.

So far as I can tell this makes such devices impossible to use with
openOCD, but I must be missing something as support for such things is
there. 
I use this config (expanding source [find ...]  lines for clarity)

-----------
jtag_khz 100

#'aleph1/xilinx' dongle
interface parport
parport_port /dev/parport0
parport_cable dlc5

set CPUTAPID 0x49265013
source [find pxa270.cfg]

reset_config none
# 29LV650 64Mbit Flash
flash bank cfi 0x00000000 0x800000 2 2 0

init
-------------

And that does the boundary-scan OK, but 'reset halt' fails (not
suprisingly as it's has no control of the reset lines) and so far as I
can tell I can't go on to do _anything_ else without getting the CPU
into state halt.

But we've been using these dongles for years to program these boards,
and so have others, so clearly it can work. 

Is there some way to make openOCD behave in a sufficiently
simple-minded manner to work with old-fashion parallel dongles?
Perhaps emitting a 'hit reset manually' message? Would that help? 

If there is then I'll finish adding support for the lart/jtux device
and send it in, but currently I'm stuck.

Wookey
