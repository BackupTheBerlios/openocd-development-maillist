Sorry, his patches committed in r1892 an r1893.  I took a little time
and looked at the changes in more depth and decided to take the risk,
but I forgot to follow up here.  I am slowly making my way through the
list and finding things that have been missed or overlooked, back to
when I posted my 'submit lost works' post.

At this point, I have a system in place to make it unlikely for me to
let any threads be forgotten, but I am still trying to catch all those
that are still in the air.  One thing you might look at is David's
recent NAND changes ([patch] more NAND cleanup and doc updates), as
those are beyond my casual knowledge.

Cheers,

Zach
