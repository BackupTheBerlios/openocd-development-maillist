<PRE>Hi all,

After working on The Manual and updating the flash.h doxygen comments,
the patches committed as r1921-r1924 fell out of my brain.   I tried to
answer a few FAQs in the process and pave the way for more work in this
area by others.  I hope this effort will add value to the community.

Rather than posting them here to generate discussion, I went ahead and
committed these changes so others can simply run 'make doxygen' to see
all of the updates as they are intended.

Both the Documentation Primer and Style Guide include placeholder
material for LaTeX.  To clarify, those sections are on the cusp of being
made relevant, pending follow-through on recent discussions of the plans
outlined by the Documentation Primer material.  I hope that the new
documentation itself shows its relevance in the wider context; for now,
my intent was simply to paint a picture of my vision of these artifacts.

The new Style Guide pages should be considered drafts.  Other than a
couple of minor warning fixes and new introductory material, the C Style
Guide was _not_ updated by these changes, despite a number of lingering
issues that have been raised in recent weeks.  Otherwise, new material
was added to &quot;finish&quot; the Doxygen Style Guide, and placeholders
introduced for the menagerie of languages used in the OpenOCD tree.

Finally, these changes provide others with places to add more material,
such as drafts for the Texinfo Primer and associated Style Guide.
Patches that include such material would be appreciated tremendously.
Please let me know if you intend to provide such an update by replying
to this thread, so others know to avoid duplicating your work.

If you have questions, suggestions or patches to fix minor problems,
please reply with them to this thread.  Major issues or patches would be
better served by starting a new thread.

Cheers,

Zach
