</I>The question is well received.

No big worry, I DO have BIG issues with this development project. I am a 
bit tired, angry no, but a bit pissed, definetly.

I will keep working to locate basic problems in oocd, but I really would 
like to start developing fun stuff for the pet beagle.

I think there is cortex-a8 work in there along the line, I will code 
according to my vision of openocd structure, but even then there will 
hopefully be useful experiences gained  for everybody.

I do not share some of your design visions, your cleanup skill are 
impressive and definetly a bonus for the project,  but then the rebuild 
starts ....

Regression reports are in a way validating some of my points but still I 
would rather have a well working system.

And I think you should repost this to the list, but it was address to me 
so you get it back.

Best Regards
Magnus
