</I>Here is a quick primer for those new to JTAG:

JTAG is unnecessarily confusing, because JTAG is often confused with 
boundary scan, which is just one of its possible functions.

JTAG is simply a communication interface designed to allow communication 
to functions contained on devices, for the designed purposes of 
initialisation, programming, testing, debugging, and anything else you 
want to use it for (as a chip designer).

Think of JTAG as I2C for testing.  It doesn't define what it can do, 
just a logical interface that allows a uniform channel for communication.

See:
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Test_Action_Group">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Test_Action_Group</A>
and
<A HREF="http://www.inaccessnetworks.com/projects/ianjtag/jtag-intro/jtag-state-machine-large.png">http://www.inaccessnetworks.com/projects/ianjtag/jtag-intro/jtag-state-machine-large.png</A>

The first page (among other things) shows a logical representation 
describing how multiple devices are wired up using JTAG.  JTAG does not 
specify, data rates or interface levels (3.3V/1.8V, etc) each device can 
support different data rates/interface logic levels.  How to wire them 
in a compatible way is an exercise for an engineer.

Basically TMS controls which shift register is placed on the device, 
between TDI and TDO.  The second diagram shows the state transitions on 
TMS which will select different shift registers.

The first thing you need to do is reset the state machine, because when 
you connect to a chip you dont know what state the jtag is in,you need 
to clock TMS as 1, at least 7 times.  This will put you into &quot;Test Logic 
Reset&quot; State.  Knowing this, you can, once reset, then track what each 
transition on TMS will do, and hence know what state the jtag state 
machine is in.

There are 2 &quot;types&quot; of shift registers.  The Instruction shift register 
and the data shift register.  The sizes of these are undefined, and can 
change from chip to chip.  The Instruction register is used to select 
which Data register/data register function is used, and the data 
register is used to read data from that function or write data to it.

Each of the states control what happens to either the data register or 
instruction register.

For example, one of the data registers will be known as &quot;bypass&quot; this is 
(usually) a single bit which has no function and is used to bypass the 
chip.  Eg, assume we have 3 identical chips, wired up like the picture 
and each has a 3 bit instruction register, and there are 2 known 
instructions (110 = bypass, 010 = some other function) if we want to use 
&quot;some other function&quot;, on the second chip in the line, and not change 
the other chips we would do these transitions:

 From Test Logic Reset -&gt;

TMS goes:  0 1 1 0 0
Which puts every chip in the chain into the &quot;Shift IR state&quot;
Then (while holding TMS as 0) TDI goes: 0 1 1  0 1 0 0 1 1
which puts the following values in the instruction shift register for 
each chip [110] [010] [110]
It is reversed, because we shift out the least significant bit first.
Then we transition TMS: 1 1 1 1 0 0
Which outs us in the &quot;Shift DR state&quot;
Now when we clock data onto TDI (again while holding TMS to 0) , the 
data shifts through the data registers, and because of the instruction 
registers we selected (some other function has 8 bits in its data 
register), our total data register in the chain looks like this:

0 00000000 0
The first and last bit are in the &quot;bypass&quot;ed chips, so values read from 
them are irrelevant and data written to them is ignored.  But we need to 
write bits for those registers, because they are in the chain.

If we wanted to write 0xF5 to the data register we would clock out of 
TDI (holding TMS to 0):
0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0
again we are clocking the lsbit first

Then we would clock TMS: 1 1 0

Which updates the selected data register with the value 0xF5 and returns 
us to run test idle.

If we needed to read the data register before over-writing it with F5, 
no sweat, that's already done, because the TDI/TDO are set up as a 
circular shift register, so if you write enough bits to fill the shift 
register, you will receive the &quot;captured&quot; contents of the data registers 
simultaneously on TDO.

That's JTAG in a nutshell.  On top of this, you need to get specs for 
chips and work out what the various instruction registers/data registers 
do, so you can actually do something useful.  That's where it gets 
interesting.  But JTAG in and of itself is actually very very simple.

Strontium.
