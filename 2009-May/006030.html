I do not understand why such taste discussions have to pop up every time
a new developer joins a project. It is simply not possible to satisfy
everyone's taste, so IMHO a project should stick to the project's
styleguides until there is *very good* reason to throw them out.

&gt;<i> I have been a tabstop=8 guy for 10 years, and tabstop=4 prior to that.
</I>&gt;<i> 8 spaces is much easier on the eyes; blocks are more clearly visible.

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I tend to prefer 2 spaces, but I don't really care since  emacs does the
indenting for me most of the time - I just need to know the preferred
style for a project directory.
&gt;<i> However, even that project helps make the point that most style rules in
</I>&gt;<i> a project can be traced back to one or more initial contributors, and
</I>&gt;<i> inertia keeps the project on that track.  In this respect, OpenOCD has
</I>&gt;<i> been using tabs and should continue to use tabs; tabstop=4 was its
</I>&gt;<i> original standard and should continue to be.  Any gradual change at this
</I>&gt;<i> point would result in a mixed soup, and total conversion offers dubious
</I>&gt;<i> value at the cost of completely disrupting everybody's working copies.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Full ACK from me. If part of the code is indented wrong, it should be
fixed, but changing *all* of the source to a new style is not the right
fix for such a problem.
&gt;<i> So the type of whitespace should be less concern than how much is used;
</I>&gt;<i> excessive indentation is a pandemic problem in the OpenOCD code.  This
</I>&gt;<i> does not mean to apportion blame; it is my observation as a professional
</I>&gt;<i> software developer.  If I were its architect, much of the code in the
</I>&gt;<i> tree would be rewritten to fix these problems, as it is virtually
</I>&gt;<i> unreadable (and thus practically unmaintainable) in its present state.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I think that comes from incremental development: in order to provide
small, easily reviewable patches, it is easier to just make the needed
changes instead of refactoring code where is is needed.
