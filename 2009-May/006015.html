<PRE>Dick,

Once again, &quot;it's not you, it's me.&quot;  Blah, blah, blah.... :)

Patch #1.  Could this be made more general purpose so that it can be
used by other USB devices?  I would expect the J-Link driver could stand
to benefit from similar support, but I could not find these changes
because of all the others.

&gt;<i> ** supports the high speed ftdi part (not tested)
</I>
Patch #2.  You appear to have dropped the additional work that I did:

This functionality looks impossible to extricate it from your patch.  I
have to admit that I am tempted to apply my patch first.  The autotools
work is required for this portion of the patch to build correctly on all
platforms and with older versions of the FTD2xx libs.  Moreover, the
current mechanism for supporting RCLK is guaranteed to be wrong for some
users without the explict configuration option.

Can I commit my version first?  I would think it should be relatively
easy to work out any resulting collisions in the patch.

&gt;<i> ** supports the reduced clock tms_seq table.
</I>
Patch #3.  Not sure of the correctness here.  Definitely should be
separated for this reason alone.

&gt;<i> ** modifies the reduce tms_seq table so that is worked with ARM9 and 
</I>&gt;<i> Olimnex and establishes
</I>&gt;<i>    a transition specific comment/documentation format for the reduced 
</I>&gt;<i> clock table, in jtag.c
</I>
Patch #4. Ditto.

&gt;<i> ** provides a reference implementation for any other drivers wishing to 
</I>&gt;<i> add reduced clock support.
</I>
Patch #5. Ditto.

[snip]
&gt;<i> Let me know if there are any problems.
</I>
Patch #6:  unrelated whitespace or style changes.  Patches of this size
should not have such cruft in them.

My rules of thumb (again, based on the Linux kernel community) says that
style changes are acceptable on lines already being changed, so long as
they improve the quality of the patch itself and move toward a community
ratified style.

Patches that mix both functional and style changes should be avoided
entirely, but that is only half the story.  I expect contributors to
work on one task per patch, submitted either one at a time or as a
series of patches.  I expect that because it is what I have come to be
expected of me; it seems to be the best practice.

Of course, I cannot expect to hold others to that standard today, as
that would be changing the rules retroactively and without consensus.
Nevertheless, I feel a little uncomfortable simply committing the patch
without it being split, and I will not presume to ask for you to do so.
As it stands, the scope of its change has the potential to impact users
of all OpenOCD interfaces; I must defer to other maintainers opinions.


In the future, I hope that I can convince the community to produce
patches that reach these standards of quality.  I do not expect everyone
to agree with my perspective, nor would I expect a transformation to
happen overnight.  Moreover, I would not want these &quot;requirements&quot; to
dissuade potential contributors from sending in their patches, as the
clean-up work can be excellent for new coders that want to learn how to
improve their coding style (and some people may never change).

As always, I am also open to criticism or comments.  If anything, send
your concerns privately; I am not try to bully the community into doing
anything that it does not already think it should be doing.  This kind
of discipline is like dieting; very few people will do it willingly, but
the results are lean and fit after all of the effort.  As I see it,
being a &quot;maintainer&quot; means keeping the community on its fitness regime;
I expect you to hate me until the results start to show. ;)

Cheers,

Zach
