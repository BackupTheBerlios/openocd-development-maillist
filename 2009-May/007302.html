<PRE>Rick Altherr a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Perhaps I'm jaded from writing code for OS X where function names are
</I>&gt;<i> intended to be descriptive and thus end up long.  Most editors include
</I>&gt;<i> autocompletion which makes the difference minimal in practice.  Even
</I>&gt;<i> when I'm writing code in vi, I prefer the longer type names since it
</I>&gt;<i> make it clear that a) it's a type by having the _t suffix and b)
</I>&gt;<i> that's an unsigned int.  With u32, there are plenty of cases where odd
</I>&gt;<i> naming collisions can occur.  It's also not clear that its an integer,
</I>&gt;<i> but just an unsigned 32-bit something.  To be entirely honest, I
</I>&gt;<i> prefer seeing long, descriptive function prototypes like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I hate the autocompletion in my editor because I think it's crap.
(slickedit) I consider it some kind of trojan which makes stupid
decisions which I most of the time disagree with.

I can understand some logic in having some descriptive value if someone
is too lazy to write comments but it is usually not necessary if
intelligent comments are used.
I find it more usefull to spend some time describing the functions.

Where I work we have coding rules but it doesn't involve descriptive
names so much as identifying what type it is and which module it belongs to.

iApp_iData1
lApp_iData1
llApp_iData1
ucApp_iData1
uiApp_iData1
ulApp_iData1
ullApp_iData1
vApp_iData1

Without telling you specifically the type you can identify easily if
rules are obeyed.

For convenience and clarity I combine the two ideas of having
descriptive names as well as comments. Descriptive names is not so
important for us as which module it is part of.

As to the &quot;unsigned int&quot; type I have a preference with u16 because it is
what ST uses in their libraries and it simplier and quicker to type. I
find no special purpose or improvement to use the long version for that.

With NEC it is U16 so I will need to override that in my system.h for my
project files.


I find the whole discussion silly and the proposed change ridiculous.
