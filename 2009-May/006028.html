I apologize for my wording coming across as arrogant, but I assure you
that I speak out of gross humility.  It is not as easy as it sounds, and
the odds are that it will fail.

Recognizing that, I am trying to be proactive about this issue and avoid
the pain that such events can cause for both sides.  This last message
was not the first time that Dick threatened to fork OpenOCD, and that is
the ultimate threat to make to an open source project.

His willingness to make such threats indicates that a problem exists.
Real or imagined, the situation frustrates him enough to see forking as
a viable option.  If his points are real, then the project does need to
change; if they are imagined, then it doesn't: he does.  I would guess
reality probably falls somewhere in the middle, with differing opinions
making up the remaining differences in our perspectives.

I want to see us find solutions.  My intended meaning was that I am
ready to discuss all topics without taking it personally.  I do not
believe my response was unwarranted; however, I apologize to everyone --
particularly Dick -- if my words came across as an expectation of
actually winning all of the subsequent arguments.  Mea culpa.

No one wins when there is a hostile fork.

Cheers,

Zach
