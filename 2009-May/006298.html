[snip]

I've argued this a number of times.  Right after I did the 0.1.0  
release, I wanted to get together a list of goals for 0.2.0.  Instead,  
rampant change was made to trunk.  Some of the items that went into  
trunk were improvements that appeared to have minimal risk, but others  
were questionable and risky.  There were frequently large commits that  
blended multiple sets of changes which made it nearly impossible to  
backport anything to the 0.1 branch making a 0.1.1 unrealistic.  Once  
a list for 0.2.0 was agreed upon, it was basically ignored.  For  
example, the Cortex-A8 support was something we wanted for 0.2.0, but  
the in_handler changes were never mentioned.  As it stands, sorting  
this out for a 0.2.0 would be a full time job.

To be clear, I'm not blaming anyone specifically.  This is a failing  
of the community and maintainers to set and follow policies on patch  
approval and release engineering.  Even some of the work I've done has  
increased the effort required to made a stable 0.2.0.

Ideally, we would have frequent enough stable releases that our  
typical users aren't living on trunk.  Having the package maintainers  
snapshot our repo should be a clear sign that something is wrong.

&gt;<i> In theory, the trunk _is_ an experimental branch to some extent.  This
</I>&gt;<i> community's reliance on it helped show that &#216;yvind surpassed the de
</I>&gt;<i> facto limit to the community's tolerance for mainline breakage.
</I>&gt;<i> Arguably, this is not his problem alone.  The community must shoulder

</I>&gt;<i> for

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agreed.  When I have some time to get my thoughts in order, I plan to  
reply to your proposal thread.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In this respect, I am starting to worry about the patches that I have
</I>&gt;<i> pending... are they too invasive?  Should I post them first?  If I  
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> to post every patch for others to consider, then why do I have commit
</I>&gt;<i> access to the repository (well, for my proposed rule above, to start).
</I>&gt;<i> Clear lines must be drawn, but these did not exist in any form.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yup.  The lack of these clear lines has created nothing but antimocity  
for anyone attempt to use or develop on the project.

&gt;<i> I tell ya':  I would be on my way out the door if I had gotten the net

</I>&gt;<i> feeling bad about the part that I played in it.  Contributing to a
</I>&gt;<i> project without meaningful processes is too much like gambling.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sadly the people trying to define and enforce meaningful processes  
tend to be given similar treatment.

&quot;He said he hadn't had a byte in three days. I had a short, so I split  
it with him.&quot;
