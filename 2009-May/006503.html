<PRE>Hmm, this is quite squirrely.  I had done a &quot;make clean&quot;
then rebuilt before reporting the failures ... but a build
which previously failed, has just started to work.

Maybe it wasn't.  I reported flakiness there before too.

 - One theory is that the build procedure sometimes leaves
   crap around.  That wouldn't quite explain everything,
   but I see such goofs often enough to think this might
   be a contributing problem.

 - Another might be that the ft2232 or JTAG code isn't
   robustly initializing ... so it's inheriting some
   external state that it shouldn't, and getting confused.

I think the second is most likely.  I do remember poking
at the device with &quot;urjtag&quot; to see if it could detect
things properly ... yes.  (And at 3 MHz, while OpenOCD
can't go faster than 1.5 MHz.)  Presumably it did some
things differently.  Maybe the &quot;openocd -d3&quot; did too.


&gt;<i> Does 1606 work?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please provide details on how you invoke OpenOCD +
</I>&gt;<i> debug_level 3 logs.
</I>
When I tried &quot;-d 3&quot; it suddenly worked, and has worked
again since.  Note -- this is with *NO* rebuild, and
using an executable which previously failed.

- Dave
