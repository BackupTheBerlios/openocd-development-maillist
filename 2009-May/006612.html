Personally, I consider bug tracking system even worse.

Not that I contributed much to OpenOCD patch review (if at all) so far, 
but my time is just too limited for me to bother commenting on a patch 
that I have to save to a file then import back into my mailer in order 
to put my comments along side the parts of the patch I wish to comment 
on.  Having to deal with a bug tracking system for commenting/reviewing 
patches constitute even more steps and is simply a turn-off for me.

I'm deeply involved in a narrow part of the Linux kernel development, 
and in that world anything else but plain patches in the email body 
simply don't scale due to the manipulation overhead mentioned above.  I 
do receive many many patches in my inbox every day. If I have the 
choice, I'll review patches for which I simply have to hit the reply 
button in my mailer and start inserting my comments inline right away 
over those that require any additional manipulations.

With regard to mailers messing up tab and spaces... well, all I can say 
is that thousands of Linux developers do use mailers that can be made to 
preserve email body content, either by default or with some config 
settings since this is what the established patch review process 
requires.  Many of those email clients are available on Windows and/or 
MAC too.  And saving the email body to a file is usually just as easy as 
saving an attachment.  Git even has a tool to pick up an email folder 
where you might have saved a bunch of patch-containing emails and apply 
them all.

Note that I'm not asking for any particular requirements here.  Simply 
stating how my review contribution is likely to be influenced by the 
patch channel.
