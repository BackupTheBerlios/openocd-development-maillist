Agreed, but that doesn't make them better for usage.  Naming every  
variable in a function with a single letter is shorter too.

</I>
I know _why_ they are there.  Keeping them by &quot;grandfathering&quot; does  
set a precedent or at least makes the rest of the type conventions  
odd.  Imagine how you would document this in the developer manual:  
&quot;All types are of the form x_t where x is a descriptive name in lower- 
case with words joined by underscores.  The name should encapsulate  
the subsystem the type is related to and what it represents.  NOTE:  
The types for defined-width integers are an exception to these rules.&quot;

&gt;<i> 3) the patch to unify the changes to short types is minor and  
</I>&gt;<i> finished:
</I>&gt;<i>  - it uses the C99 types fully, so we get all of their benefits
</I>&gt;<i>  - it will fix portability problems on some 64-bit architectures
</I>&gt;<i>  - it leaves the code more correct than it was before the patch
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agreed.  Of course, that doesn't mean that it is the only option or  
even the option we want to go with.  A similar patch can provide all  
of those same benefits by using the C99 types directly but doesn't  
have the &quot;is minor and already finished&quot; part.

&gt;<i> Further, you can argue with the following assertions -- only if you

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A patch to use C99 types would be:

These usually fall into the &quot;large but mechanical&quot; bucket and are easy

&gt;<i> - a major source functional regressions.
</I>
Assuming that u32 is a typedef for uint32_t, then there is no  
possibility of a functional regression.  If u32 _isn't_ a typedef for  
uint32_t, then moving the short types to be based on the C99 types has  
just as much likelihood for functional regressions.

&quot;He said he hadn't had a byte in three days. I had a short, so I split  
it with him.&quot;
