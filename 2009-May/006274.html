<PRE>&gt;<i> No arguments here.  You cut out the part of my reply where I agreed
</I>&gt;<i> with you on this exact point.  The execution was far from ideal.
</I>
If you already said it, my not reposting it does not in any way invalidate
it.

&gt;<i> I am not advocating either way; however, you failed to address my point
</I>&gt;<i> about this community's resistance to change.  If anything, you make it
</I>&gt;<i> by presuming that I am in favor of these particular changes.
</I>
I'm not presuming you're in favor of anything or not.  What point is there to
address about resistance to change?
I think people are resistant to unmanaged change and/or change that causes
breakage.
 
&gt;<i> We have not ignored them, but the rest is our SNAFU.
</I>
I think they were largely ignored.  To me, just plodding ahead while saying
&quot;I hear you, but I'm doing it anyway&quot; and ignoring are pretty much the same
result.
When you say &quot;our&quot; who are you referring to? 
 
&gt;<i> How do you do development?  Do you say: &quot;I am not sure how I am going
</I>&gt;<i> to fix this problem, so I should not even start.&quot;  I hope not.
</I>
Well I think that depends on whether I'm doing development for myself, or for
others.
If I'm working on something that other people use, I would probably solicit
an idea, or if I wanted to try something without, I would probably do it in a
private branch.

&gt;<i> I continue to be happy to receive complaints about the project, on or
</I>&gt;<i> off the list.  Funny though, no one seems complain except a few vocal
</I>&gt;<i> folks that only post to this list.  I am not interested in placating
</I>&gt;<i> cowards that are unable to directly address their issues with us.
</I>
No one needs to address their issues directly with you versus the community
at large.  
It's GPL'd code -- need I say any more.

&gt;<i> Both of the individuals that chose to leave the community were given
</I>&gt;<i> ample opportunities to try and resolve their issues.  They chose not to
</I>&gt;<i> work out their differences; I personally bent over backwards in both
</I>&gt;<i> cases to appease them, but I failed in both cases.  I am not happy
</I>&gt;<i> about that outcome either, so I rather resent the implications you make
</I>here.

Again, I don't think it's so much about you personally versus the direction
of the project at large.
You can feel how you want about anything I say, that won't change what
happened.

&gt;<i> To the community:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you have a beef, you need to air it and get it settled -- or leave.
</I>
I think that's pretty much what happened, except it was the latter in both
cases.
 
&gt;<i> I will take an intolerant view to people that present a consistently
</I>&gt;<i> negative attitude and disrupt this community.  Such people are trolls
</I>&gt;<i> and should be banished from any community.  It's happened to me, and
</I>&gt;<i> the shame of those incidents taught me how to be more civil.  I will not
</I>&gt;<i> hesitate to shame those who I see behaving badly, as I have come to
</I>&gt;<i> expect to be shamed myself.
</I>
I am glad that you feel that you can take it upon yourself to decide who
should be shamed and not for expressing their feelings.

Please keep any correspondence in the mailing list.  This is not a personal
issue to me, so I don't need to handle it in private email.

Thanks

--Chris
