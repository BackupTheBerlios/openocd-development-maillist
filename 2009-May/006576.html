This is &quot;Recruiter&quot;, and you can never be done with that job.

&gt;<i> - commit good patches to svn quickly so as to encourage contributors
</I>
I am seeing the need for at least one &quot;always open to commit&quot; testing
branch that allows this kind of behavior, but this is off-topic.
These topics will get their own thread soon enough.

&gt;<i> - keep an eye on performance. OpenOCD has a unique capability
</I>&gt;<i> of supporting *both* high processing power high latency(USB &amp; TCP/IP)
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces *and* low processing power low latency(embedded hosts).
</I>&gt;<i> The policy of OpenOCD is that all interfaces are equal, but if an
</I>&gt;<i> interface is no longer maintained or tested, then the community
</I>&gt;<i> has no responsibility for it. I like that: only if we take responsibility
</I>&gt;<i> do we have responsiblity :-)
</I>&gt;<i> - there are, still, architectural problems with OpenOCD.
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to make these changes if they make the code more clear,
</I>&gt;<i> reduces # of lines of code, more robust to changes(i.e. that changing
</I>&gt;<i> X doesn't break Y) and there is a reasonable way to transition
</I>&gt;<i> and retest.
</I>&gt;<i> - target testing &amp; qualification. I want a list of supported and tested
</I>&gt;<i> targets/flash devices. It is not so much that I want everything to
</I>&gt;<i> work than that I want to know *what* I can claim to work. It's OK
</I>&gt;<i> if an older version has to be used for some obsolete target
</I>&gt;<i> hardware.
</I>&gt;<i> - I want to get the basic architecture and inner workings of
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD right &amp; stable so we can have long term stability

</I>&gt;<i> users, few targets and we could do what we wanted. Now
</I>&gt;<i> is the time when  we can make changes relatively easily.
</I>
So to sum these up:
- performance
- architecture
- testing/qualification
- stability

I think all of these goals fall under &quot;major contributing developer&quot;, if
not &quot;systems architect&quot;.  I think that everyone needs to share this
later hat in a meritocratic fashion: in open source, those who propose,
seek consensus on, and implement major changes are the Architects.

However, I think there is a more important role that you play, which
needs to be called out -- if only to draw out others from the same bush.
Given that Zylin AS produces the ZY1000, you are an OpenOCD &quot;Vendor&quot;.
Right now, I am not sure what that means, but it deserves mention.
In fact, I think this point deserves a thread of its own.  Stay tuned.

Personally, I think that Zylin AS has been an excellent OpenOCD citizen.
Providing support for the community is frequently a thankless task, and
you have done a first-rate job of communicating with and supporting the
community.  Despite any mistakes you may have made recently, I think you
deserve high praise for your long-term commitment to the project.

Cheers,

Zach
