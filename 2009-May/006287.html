<PRE>&gt;<i> It's called &quot;quoting out of context&quot;.  Your editing of the thread
</I>&gt;<i> changes the tone of the thread for anyone that jumps in at the middle.
</I>&gt;<i> If you are doing this on purpose, it is dishonest (and flabbergasting).
</I>&gt;<i> If you are doing it out of ignorance, you should be aware of the
</I>&gt;<i> consequences and implications that such actions have for readers.
</I>
OK.  I'm not going to spend time arguing this with you.
 
&gt;<i> When you make use of such selective quotes and argue with me, you
</I>&gt;<i> should expect your motives to get called into question.  You are
</I>potentially
&gt;<i> using fallacious logic that has been obfuscated by failing to provide
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient context.   Given the nature of this thread, it lends
</I>&gt;<i> credibility to the hypothesis that you are a troll, though I have been
</I>&gt;<i> privately informed that such is not the case.  The jury is still out.
</I>
You got me.  I'm saying this all to make you look bad, because I have the
inclination and that kind of time to spend.

&gt;<i> I was listening the whole time.  I wanted to see it resolved on
</I>&gt;<i> technical merits.  At the moment, we are debating process merits.
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, I am fairly certain that these human issues are causing the
</I>&gt;<i> real problems, not issues with the code at all.
</I>
I'm not so much interested in the philosophy here as the results.
 
&gt;<i> No processes for branching exist; OpenOCD has not done this.  No one
</I>&gt;<i> can be blamed for violating policies to use branches when said policies do
</I>&gt;<i> not even exist.  That said: no individual developer should get to use
</I>&gt;<i> the trunk as their individual sandbox and be able to run amok like
</I>&gt;<i> this.
</I>
Common sense here, please.

&gt;<i> Some people may be afraid (or unable) to speak up in public because of
</I>&gt;<i> their circumstances or personal disposition.  I am offering my services
</I>&gt;<i> as a mediator between unhappy individuals and the existing maintainers.
</I>&gt;<i> I am too new to be a member of the &quot;old boys club&quot;, but I have earned
</I>&gt;<i> enough respect from the other maintainers to have commit privileges.
</I>&gt;<i> This last fact may give hope to those who are otherwise losing it, and
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps they will send a note to share their perspective.  I don't
</I>&gt;<i> know.
</I>
I think if it's gotten to the point that a moderator is needed, it's already
in some serious trouble.

&gt;<i> If I cannot provide this service, then I ask you: who can?  And do you
</I>&gt;<i> at least agree that such mediation could be valuable to the community?
</I>&gt;<i> Do my efforts in this area appear to be less than sincere?  Should I be
</I>&gt;<i> trying a different approach at this kind of diplomacy?  I want to learn
</I>&gt;<i> if you have genuine suggestions for improving, but I do not think you
</I>&gt;<i> speak for the community's need for some type of outlet.
</I>
To be perfectly clear, I'm not speaking for anyone other than myself.
 
&gt;<i> So, what is your point about the GPL?  That they can fork us?  Or that
</I>&gt;<i> you will fork us?  You have lost me, so -- yes -- you really do need to
</I>&gt;<i> say more.  Given the character of your e-mails, I must now necessarily
</I>&gt;<i> view you as a threat to the project until you clear this up.  So sad,
</I>&gt;<i> this ambiguity of language; it is so easy to have your words twisted.
</I>&gt;<i> Does this at least help show why I am a sticker for context?
</I>
My point is that anyone can do whatever they want with the code.  I don't
view a &quot;threat&quot; to a GPL project as being possible.
I think it would've been better to have a few forks or private branches,
because we wouldn't have lost two good developers.
 
&gt;<i> If things are really this bad, maybe I should just resign.  This would
</I>&gt;<i> make three threats to fork in as many weeks, and that is enough to make
</I>&gt;<i> me think that I am carrying around some kind of curse.  Certainly, I am
</I>&gt;<i> growing weary of trying to help put out the flames on the list and then
</I>&gt;<i> feeling its infernal warmth spread to my own personage.
</I>
I'm not &quot;threatening&quot; to do anything.  I don't have any cycles to put towards
a fork at the moment.  
Please tone down the drama.  This is code, not a soap opera.

&gt;<i> Thank you for saying this, but the implication that offended me was
</I>&gt;<i> that my efforts somehow related to the individuals that left.  This fact
</I>was
&gt;<i> once again lost due to your selective quoting.  Will you concede that I
</I>&gt;<i> have tried at every turn to prevent Bad Things for the community?
</I>
I wouldn't ever say that.  Only they can say why they left.  I'm not making
any comments one way or another about anything you've done personally.  
This isn't and never was about you personally.
 
&gt;<i> I would continue to welcome both Jeff and Dick back to the community,
</I>&gt;<i> and I have seen enough of a pattern here to know what it might take.
</I>&gt;<i> That will require a new thread after a good night's sleep, though.
</I>
&gt;<i> Hi.  I am an American.  We have the Right to Freedom of Speech.  This
</I>&gt;<i> was sent on my internet, so I will use that Right.  I think that
</I>&gt;<i> society has gone to hell in a hand-basket precisely because we have stopped
</I>&gt;<i> shaming each other into civil behavior.
</I>
OK that's great.  I am an American too, and I don't share your view w.r.t.
shaming people.
I do think, however, that's a great way to have people quickly become tired
of dealing with a person who does that and just get up and leave.

&gt;<i> However, I will ask you to be more careful with your replies to avoid
</I>&gt;<i> the selective quoting.  You will not see me reply to your posts if you
</I>&gt;<i> continue to pull such tricks, intentional or not.
</I>
I quote where I have something to reply to.  I can assure you that I am not
spending the time to try to selectively quote you or make you look bad.
If people don't read the entire thread and take things out of context, not my
concern or problem.

I can definitely tell you at this point that if I were to start working on
OpenOCD, I would fork it.  That's not intended to be any kind of threat or
provocation.  I would still take things from this current effort where I
thought they made sense.  It's just a different philosophy about development.
Just like how there are multiple variants of the Linux kernel tree.  In
retrospect, I would've much rather seen that happen versus losing Jeff and
Dick.

Anyhow, you can have the last word here because it's not really going
anywhere useful.

Thanks

--Chris
