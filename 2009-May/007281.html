Incorrect, I have one, do you need it? I could provide some binaries on
my web site if I have space left.
It is about two years old, I am trying to get the lastest source but am
having some problem with the company who so far
has refused to abide by the GPL. They did provide me with the source a
couple of years ago.
I may look into updating the new sources myself but this is not my top
priority at the moment.
Which version would you need? I have Mandriva 2009.0, Fedora 9, SuSE
11.1 and Ubuntu 8.10 systems.
I do have GCC for Renesas as well. If someone needs it I would need to
recompile it under the new systems.
Last I worked with it was with Fedora 8. I do have the latest source for
Renesas.

&gt;<i> So even though they have free DAS JTAG server which supports
</I>&gt;<i> cheap USB Jtag tools, it may not be that effective to offer OpenOCD support.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="ftp://ftp.extra.infineon.com/MC_Skits_SW/UC-UConnect_XE164/Tools/DAS/DAS_Product_Brief_v1_0.pdf">ftp://ftp.extra.infineon.com/MC_Skits_SW/UC-UConnect_XE164/Tools/DAS/DAS_Product_Brief_v1_0.pdf</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> M16C and H8/H8S do have gcc support. But I do not know if there are any
</I>&gt;<i> cheap non-Renesas debugging tools for them. Renesas tools are getting
</I>&gt;<i> cheaper though. I even got a free M16C Tiny kit (a USB debugger and
</I>&gt;<i> a startkit board) from them just by visiting their website and put in some
</I>&gt;<i> contact information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not familiar with Fujitsu and NEC MCUs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Fujitsu micros require an emulator. I work with them on gauges and
clusters. The emulator cost us about $12000

NEC has some real low cost 8 bits micros, some 16 bits and 32 bits
micros also relatively low cost.
Future is the distributor.

You can get a debugger for the 8 bits devices for about $150 for the 8K
devices.

&gt;<i> So I will vote for PIC32 support first (being a Microchip fan and since the
</I>&gt;<i> support is more or less in place), then MSP430/AVR32/AVR support, then
</I>&gt;<i> ColdFire support. But of course the priority should be to get ARM
</I>&gt;<i> stable with different cores. ST, TI/Luminary, Atmel, NXP (No 6 to 10)
</I>&gt;<i> are all ARM MCU Vendors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>My impression so far is that Atmel is probably farther ahead than
Microchip on the 32 bits devices. Microchip seems very far behind in the
automotive industry.
I should find out more this week. I won't be able to give any specific
details on their plan but I can say that they are not ready for me to
take them seriously for new designs.
Atmel doesn't have full documentation on the CAN AVR32 devices because
they are waiting for the demo boards to be out. Parts were available for
sampling last year.

Because Atmel is much friendlier to the opensource I would vote for them
if there was to be one over the other. I still think that both types of
devices need serious
consideration. Microchip is not very friendly to the opensource world
but their stuff works. I am always fascinated with their devices when we
do the harsh environment tests.
I hate the Microchip banking shit on the 8 bits devices but hardware
wise they are hard to beat. One could assume that their 32 bits devices
will be just as good.

If some preference is made on one over the other I would suggest to put
more importance on the AVR32 devices not targeted for Linux as they are
the likely devices to be use for most small embedded designs. Unlike the
bigger AVR32 devices they do not require uboot but require some form of
JTAG debugging much like ARM7 or cortex devices.

Parallel designs should be in place. I am very interested in having a
PIC32 debug working and am spending time on this effort. I will not
present any patches until I get something
working to my satisfaction. I would like to be informed though if anyone
else is working on it so we can exchange ideas.
