You were clear.  I just didn't spare the time to perform further tests 
until now.

&gt;<i> If 1606 and svn head is the same, then the 10% performance
</I>&gt;<i> degradation you are seing happened between 1520 and
</I>&gt;<i> 1606 presumably.
</I>
Well, from results above, I think no conclusion is possible.  There is 
simply too much variations.  One could tell from the above that r1776 is 
faster on average, but I've seen it go in the 93 second range as well 
before, which led to my initial remark about possible residual 
regression.  If anything, svn head doesn't appear any worse than 1606 or 
1520 at this point.

&gt;<i> Another thing to test is to use &quot;verify_jtag disable&quot; that I
</I>&gt;<i> added this morning to svn head...
</I>
I prefer not disabling any kind of self check features for such an error 
prone communication link.
