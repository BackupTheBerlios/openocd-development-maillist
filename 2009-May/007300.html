</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I pulled this particular example from another project I'm working on,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The compiler doesn't care about names, so we should optimize them for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which people?  People that need to have their hands held with long
</I>&gt;<i> fluffy names?  Or for advanced coders that they can handle (and  
</I>&gt;<i> prefer)
</I>&gt;<i> the shorter conventions?  We should not dumb-down the OpenOCD code,  
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> that is _exactly_ what you are describing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
New developers to the project.  Not all advanced coders _prefer_  
shorter names just to save on typing.  I'm not suggesting we &quot;dumb- 
down&quot; anything.  Using cryptic short names to save on typing is an  
elitist attitude that makes the barrier to entry for new developers  
higher and makes the time to come up to speed on a portion of the  
codebase longer.  Code should be clear and concise.  If a longer  
function name describes the effect of the function better, then it  
should be the longer name.  That doesn't mean that every function  
should have a long name.  Same for types.  If a longer or additional  
type name would clarify the code, then it should be used.  u32 doesn't  
clarify anything.  It just replaces the familiar type defined by a  
well-known standard with something 5 characters shorter.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2) More importantly, this patch applies the principle of least  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> change.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> These changes both unify the type system around the types that are
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> defined in &quot;types.h&quot; (and with the Linux kernel).  Thus, we achieve
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> conformance to an internal (and external) standard that we can  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> enforce
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> from here on.  With less typing (this goes both for the types
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> themselves
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and for the changes necessary to convert the entire tree to use the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> types that are used in only a handful of files today).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Given that the state of the code is a hodgepodge of various naming
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conventions, I don't see it being a good source for &quot;it was mostly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that way already&quot;.  I'd rather we chose a sensible convention based  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> merits and apply it wholesale rather than just letting majority rule.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Clearly you have not looked at the code with regard to this issue.
</I>&gt;<i> The code is NOT a &quot;hodgepodge&quot; when it comes to these types.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I was referring to the grander concerns for following the &quot;it was  
mostly that way already&quot; philosophy.  The use of types is probably the  
_only_ mostly consistent item in the whole source tree.  I would hate  
to see the use of that philosophy here as justification for doing so  
in other cases.

&gt;&gt;<i> Having the types align with the Linux kernel is of effectively no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> importance.  I happen to do all my development on OS X which follows
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the C99 naming standards for anything in the BSD layer.  Familiarity
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in this case doesn't hold across the gamut of our developer base.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How about familiarity with the OpenOCD code, which uses these types?
</I>&gt;<i> How about the fact that 99% of the OpenOCD code already uses them?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
See above.  It's more of a concern about the slippery slope on using  
that justification.  Since you brought it up, however, there are ~10  
people who are familiar with the OpenOCD code base.  Any given new  
developer has a good chance of being unfamiliar with these types since  
they are far from a standard convention.  Now, for u32 specifically, I  
don't think the jump is too hard, but if we go down this path of  
choosing type names that are optimized for typing, it can easily get  
out of hand and confusing.  Just consider the short form of intmax_t  
following the convention proposed: smax.  Tell me that that has a low  
chance of being confusing or hitting conflicts.  Do we also shorten  
the type names for things like struct jtag_tap_s?  Does it become 'j',  
'jtag', 'tap', ...?

&gt;<i> Sorry Rick, but I think that you and Duane have lost this argument.
</I>&gt;<i> You have failed to defend your position with facts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I could say the same of everyone else.  Considering the entire issue  
is rooted in preference, there are no hard facts to be presented.   
Some prefer to have shorter names, some prefer to have more  
descriptive names.  Either option is workable, but in my experience  
with introducing developers to projects, more descriptive names and  
types lower the barrier to entry and reduce the amount of guidance the  
current developers need to provide.

&gt;<i> Cheers,
