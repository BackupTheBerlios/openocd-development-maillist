More openly.

 * It feels needlessly like a &quot;closed membership club&quot;:

   - Open the mailing list so patches can be submitted
     by members of the &quot;broader community&quot;, not just folk
     who subscribe and want to participate/argue/etc

   - Don't &quot;just commit&quot; patches to the trunk that have
     never been presented to the list, or discussed.
     (Exceptions include emergency build fixes and such.)

   - Commit comments should be more informative than
     the single line $SUBJECT which now seems routine.

   - Improve docs on (current) architecture and
     implementation.  And all commands accessible
     via telnet or in init scripts ... did I even
     see the concept &quot;these commands are not usable
     interactively&quot; in the documentation?

   - Adopt somewhat more-formal policies, defining
     roles of maintainers and submitters clearly.
     They of course need to be flexible, but right
     now it looks way too ad-hoc.  And follow those
     policies (even maintainers).

 * Adopt a more distributed model.  Examples might be:

   - More routine posting/reviewing of [patch 1/4]
     type series, sometimes including [patch 0/4] type
     overviews.  So that more people can know what's
     going on ... the code does *NOT* stand by itself,
     there are models behind it that not everyone knows.
     (And if more people knew, there could be pushback
     which some wouldn't like ... but usually it's a
     net improvement, to have effective reviews.)

   - Consider using GIT.  It's not that SVN isn't
     workable, but parallel development is easier
     with GIT:  anyone can get a writable repository.
     Plus, other near-the-hardware projects like Linux
     or U-Boot use it ... so the relevent developers
     are probably using it already.

   - This includes making it easy to create trees or
     branches with experimental stuff, that's easily
     testable, which may take a long time, etc.

   - I'm surprised there aren't more examples of TCL
     code to do things like init PLLs and memory
     controllers, load-and-run programs (like u-boot
     or the Linux kernel), and so on.  That's a kind
     of *functional* distribution ... user-contributed
     code, board support, etc.

 * Improve code quality.  Examples at a micro level are
   easy to come by, which is evidence of sloppiness.
   That generally follows through to macro levels...

   - Recent patches that swap &quot;&lt;indent&gt;&lt;code&gt;&quot; with
     &quot;&lt;indent&gt;&lt;whitespace&gt;&quot; instead of just removing
     those lines; or needlessly add more blank lines.

   - Lots of end-of-line whitespace should just be
     scrubbed ... folk seem not to be using editor
     settings that highlight such goofage.  Likewise,
     scrub pointless blank lines (three or four in a
     row, in the middle of functions).

   - Inconsistent formatting ... &quot;a=b&quot; vs &quot;a = b&quot;,
     &quot;if(&quot; vs &quot;if (&quot;, and so on.  Comments.

   - Consider grabbing the Linux &quot;checkpatch.pl&quot; and
     using it ... both to sanity new check patches,
     and to help clean up existing code.

   - And surely there are technical cleanups too. ;)

Thats from my very limited perspective, as an experienced
developer who's just recently started (re)looking at OOCD.

- Dave
