I do not blame you for feeling this way; I am getting frustrated too,
primarily by the high levels of frustration in the community. :)

</I>
Will you share your vision and work with the community to put in place
consensus-driven processes and plans?  If you see problems or have
better ideas, then you need to air them fully, or you will have little
recourse other than to continue being frustrated.

</I>
I hope you will contribute to clearing things up so we can move forward
in unison.  I want us to get past this ugly chapter and get the project
back on the right track.

Thus, I will now be turning my full-time attention to OpenOCD's project
management issues, even though I did not come seeking such involvement.
Come to think of it, how did I even let myself become a maintainer?!?!
Quite simply, I would rather be working on the code,  but these problems
must be resolved to the community's satisfaction before I will feel
comfortable pushing my own work forward.

Expect my forthcoming posts to address these issues head-on and through
to their resolution.

Cheers,

Zach
