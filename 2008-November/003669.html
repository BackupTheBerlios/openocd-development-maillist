&gt;<i> &gt; I agree totally with this, I think this would be a *GREAT* idea.

</I>&gt;<i> So what would this mean technically?

</I>
I think that would have to evolve.  Urjtag is certainly more aimed at logic
devices (CPLD, FPGA), and OpenOcd seems more catered to processors, where
flash &amp; eeprom chips fall in this continuum remains to be seen, it seems
both have some, but perhaps not much, support for memory devices.  I find
myself using both frequently, as CPLD's are a good compliment to ARM7's.
Perhaps some form of cooperation, or maybe all that's needed is a pointer to
eachother's documentation to make people aware of the situations when one
might be preferred.  Seperating the back-end of both projects into libs
(i.e. libopenocd &amp; liburjtag) such that either front-end can support the
backends cleanly comes to mind.  I like the lib approach, as I can envision
a front-end that pushes all the scripts into a single command-line for
utilizing make variables without creating intermediate files.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What about the people. Is the culture compatible?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I haven't seen anything that would make me think otherwise.  Urjtag is
headed by Kolja Waschk &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">urjtag at ixo.de</A>&gt; with alot of help by &quot;Arnim L&#228;uger&quot; &lt;
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">arnim.laeuger at gmx.net</A>&gt;, you might drop them a 'hello' note and see where it
leads...both projects seem to be very actively developed right now.

Best,
Steve
