<PRE>Be forewarned that I have no idea how the cfi flash driver works at  
all so everything I'm about to say is based on guesses.

This typically indicates that the flash driver wants to use RAM in the  
target as a scratch area for the flash algorithm.  Since you haven't  
designated a working area, it can't use it.  For other drivers, this  
causes the flash driver to fall back to a byte-by-byte flashing.  I'm  
not sure what the fallback case for the cfi driver is.

This seems to imply that even without the working area, the flashing  
continued in 0x100 byte increments.  I find that suspicious, but as I  
said, I don't know the cfi flash driver at all.

</I>
As far as I understand, this means we were looking for a 0x1 and got a  
0x1f.  I don't know at what level, but this seems to be part of the  
failure mode.

</I>
Yet the flash algorithm kept going.....

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Runtime error, file &quot;?&quot;, line 1:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
And then we get the error that says the flash failed at the initial  
byte.  If nothing else, this error message is wrong since it appears  
that the flash algorithm had gotten to 0xc2d00 before failing.

&gt;<i> Any suggestion? Thanks
</I>&gt;<i>

You might try designating some target RAM as a working area.  It seems  
the flash algorithm would prefer to have some working area available.   
It shouldn't be necessary, but I don't know how the cfi driver works.   
The old syntax for designating a working area is the working_area  
command and the new syntax is a set of configure options for a  
target.  Look at the example configs that come with OpenOCD for a  
reference.

&quot;He said he hadn't had a byte in three days. I had a short, so I split  
it with him.&quot;
