Ok, I have my target fixed, and did a little more investigation. 

My previous patch does issue jtag_add_tlr() whenever xsvf_add_statemove(TAP_TLR)
is called. Now, due to the side effects of jtag_add_tlr() this might not be
an entirely good idea :-(. Because at the end of many xsvf operations, there
is a call to xsvf_add_statemove(xsvf_to_tap[xendir]) or [xenddr], and it
seems that xendir and xenddr are &quot;Test-Logic-Reset&quot; by default.

Thus, jtag_add_tlr() gets called in the middle of command sequences and
resets the whole chain and returns all devices to bypass.

Can someone give me a pointer on how to handle this? Is there a way to put
the state machine into TLR, but without the side effects? Or would it be
better to substitute TAP_RTI in these places? Or did I miss something
entirely?

Peter
