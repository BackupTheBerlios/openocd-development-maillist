</I>&gt;<i> Our ZY1000 product uses OpenOCD like a library and builds on it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We could certainly build on a library that catered for non-MCU
</I>&gt;<i> devices too :-)

</I>&gt;<i> Could you be a bit more specific as to what you imagine this would
</I>&gt;<i> entail on either end?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If you are talking about openocd vs. urjtag, I can't really comment on the
code, as I haven't done much development.

If you are talking about non-mcu devices, I think what most people would use
is something that will take a .hex or .elf file and squirt it over the jtag
but with I2C or SPI EEPROM or NAND/NOR flash programming algoritms instead
of jtag, I sort of thought there was some support for that already, I don't
have any such devices.  Just thought it was an obvious convergence.

If you are talking about the lib functions, I'd just like to see a simple
(and maybe this is impossible) command-line that will flash an lpc2000 over
jtag without starting up the daemon (currently I'm stuck always calling my
programs main.c, because main.elf is in my script file) - something
canonical over the command line would be more applicable to calling
something along the lines of:

openocd -interface ft2232 -ft2232_layout &quot;olimex-jtag&quot; -reset_config none
-jtag_device 4 0x1 0xf 0xe -target create target0 arm7tdmi -endian little
-chain-position 0 -variant arm7tdmi-s_r4 -flash bank lpc2000 0x0 0x7d000 0 0
0 lpc2000_v2 14745 -arm7_9 dcc_downloads enable -flash probe 0 -flash
auto_erase on -flash write_image $(TARGET).elf

No idea if command lines are still limited to 255 chars, no doubt that would
put a kink in my idea.

I think the main problems with this working smoothly for me is that I'm a
hardware jock origonally, so I don't have TRST or SRST hooked up in any of
my jtag headers, and there's been alot of keyword/architecture changes since
the examples folder was updated.  Rick was helping me update things, but the
serial bootloader on the lpc's works well enough I haven't had any pressure
to figure it out yet

I think the current setup makes good sense for debugging, which is the main
use of openocd.  I try to avoid debugging as a matter of routine, however.
All the 8-bit micros were pretty much useless with debugging realtime
anyway.  Maybe the trace stuff on the arm7 makes that untrue...

Best,
Steve
