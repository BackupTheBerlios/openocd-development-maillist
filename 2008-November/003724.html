<PRE>======================

duane&gt;  # Example: Declare a chip, for example some Xilinx FPGA
duane&gt;  jtag newtap xilinx   -chip xilinx  -ir-length  6 -ir-capture 
???? -ir-mask ????

rick&gt; [I don't like chip]

I prefer &quot;chip&quot; for one reason. Physically that is what is present on 
the board.

However, based on your comments - see below...

======================

rick&gt; [use the name 'create' not newtap]

Agreed.

======================

duane&gt; [examples of creating chips and creating an 'object' command]

rick&gt; If a separate jtag namespace was used, these would change to:
rick&gt;
rick&gt; jtag configure omap3530_icepick -enable
rick&gt; jtag configure omap3530_foo -disable

That works for me. Perhaps you are right about creating more and more 
names :-(

However, based on your comments - I have another suggestion.

======================

What if we changed the syntax like this:

jtag  create  CHIPNAME    TAPNAME  .... options ...

For example:    
    jtag create   -chip omap3530  -tap  icepick    ... options ...
    jtag create   -chip omap3530  -tap dsp
    jtag create   -chip omap3530  -tap foo
    jtag create    -chip omap 3530 -tap cortexA8
    jtag create   -chip omap3530  -tap bar

Then the configuration step becomes some what verbose...  but abundantly 
clear

    jtag configure -chip NAME -tap NAME    ... options ....

======================

duane&gt;  jtag chiporder stm32  xilinx  omap3530

rick&gt;  If the chiporder (or grouporder) isn't specified, what is the 
default?  Do we fall back to using the order they were declared in?

I really hate things that &quot;assume an order&quot; - they become very fragile.
If there is exactly one &quot;chip&quot; - we are ok, issue a warning.  If there 
is more then 1 &quot;chip&quot; - we issue an abundantly clear error message and 
refuse to work.

 From a &quot;user documentation point of view&quot; - I want the user to see 
something that screams at them;

   The chips are configured in the following order.....

People would understand the English sentence - because they can look at 
a schematic of their board.

   &quot;I have 4 chips in my jtag chain,  the order is: (1)  PIC32,   (2) 
Xilinx XYZ123, (3)  an STM32, (4) Omap3530&quot;

I laughed when I saw your earlier comment

 &gt;&gt; Hurray!  Someone uses the built-in configs.

Those 4 example chips - would in theory - have built-in configs and be 
&quot;included&quot; by some means.

Maybe - as we get there - the ORDER one includes/sources the CFG files - 
specifies the Jtag Tap order?

===================

rick&gt;  The extension of the namespace separation would be that targets 
would be their own namespace as well.  Thus, this would change to :
rick&gt;  jtag configure omap3530_cortexA8 -event reset-assert-post 
omap3530_enable_cortex_A8

No, the target names are good for other purposes - they are in reality a 
first class thing that you are talking to. It is the debug taget after all.

For example - one might have a dual core chip to debug (ie: DSP + ARM)

For example - one might want to read/write memory on a specific debug 
target...

===================

rick&gt;  I assume that by using jtag events you expect to add them. 

Those events exist now - as part of the target system.

Look at &quot;target.c&quot; and &quot;target.h&quot; - search for &quot;TARGET_EVENT_*&quot;

We could add jtag events - if we need them.

===================
