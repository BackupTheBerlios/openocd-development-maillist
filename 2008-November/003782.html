Sure, but any attempt to _use_ a target can easily display the error  
that &quot;no targets are defined.&quot;  That makes it very clear what happened  
and what needs to be fixed but also lets people like me run the daemon  
without declaring a target at the time that the daemon is launched.   
That way, I can create and delete targets in a single session to test  
syntax changes, etc.


&gt;<i> rick&gt; For future use, I could even see allowing multiple interfaces

</I>
Sadly, I tend to fall into that 0.01% frequently.  I've had projects  
with 2 separate devices on separate JTAG chains which required 2  
interfaces.

&gt;<i> If they are talking to 2 interfaces - it is not unreasonable to

</I>
Although it isn't technically necessary.  It would be much more  
forward-thinking and extensible to define a way to have multiple  
interfaces and a way to assign targets to interfaces and then assign  
gdb servers to targets.  If done correctly, the simple case of 1  
interface with 1 target on 1 gdb server wouldn't require any  
additional setup.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is a higher chance of somebody having 2 CPUs on a single JTAG  
</I>&gt;<i> chain (this exists now - ie: BeagleBoard OMAP has  DSP + the ARM)
</I>&gt;<i> Although to day - openocd does not support the dsp debug stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm thinking of this as a N:M:P problem where there are N gdb servers  
mapped onto M targets which are mapped onto P interfaces.  That  
provides flexibility for future designs and doesn't really change the  
internals of OpenOCD much.  We already has a pointer to the interface  
structure since we don't know which type of interface is in use.  This  
just maintains a list of active interfaces and adds a config option  
when creating a target to specify which interface to use.

&quot;He said he hadn't had a byte in three days. I had a short, so I split  
it with him.&quot;
