That's a pretty narrow focus for the designator.  If someone had 2  
boards that shared a JTAG chain, they might wish to group all devices  
on each board.  They wouldn't call that a chip.  If you want to  
designate a group of taps with a common starting point in the chain  
with a name, it shouldn't be restricted to chips.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> jtag  create  CHIPNAME    TAPNAME  .... options ...
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>   jtag create    -chip omap 3530 -tap cortexA8
</I>&gt;<i>   jtag create   -chip omap3530  -tap bar
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then the configuration step becomes some what verbose...  but  
</I>&gt;<i> abundantly clear
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   jtag configure -chip NAME -tap NAME    ... options ....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
What namespace are the chips and taps put into?  What does target  
creation look like?  Do they need to specify the chip and tap as two  
separate arguments?

&gt;<i> ===================
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> rick&gt;  The extension of the namespace separation would be that  
</I>&gt;<i> targets would be their own namespace as well.  Thus, this would  
</I>&gt;<i> change to :
</I>&gt;<i> rick&gt;  jtag configure omap3530_cortexA8 -event reset-assert-post  
</I>&gt;<i> omap3530_enable_cortex_A8
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, the target names are good for other purposes - they are in  
</I>&gt;<i> reality a first class thing that you are talking to. It is the debug  
</I>&gt;<i> taget after all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think we are both confused here.  I wasn't sure if you were setting  
the event on the target name or the jtag tap.  I wrote the above  
assuming you were referring to a reset on the jtag tap.  If you were  
referencing the target name, then you were confused and accidentally  
used the jtag tap name providing further need for separating the  
namespaces.  I had meant that targets would have their own namespace  
and would be be used something like:

target configure tgt_omap3530 -event reset-assert-post  
omap3530_enable_cortex_A8

so it is clear which namespace we are in.

&gt;<i> For example - one might have a dual core chip to debug (ie: DSP + ARM)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example - one might want to read/write memory on a specific  
</I>&gt;<i> debug target...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I wasn't advocating getting rid of targets all together.  I was  
advocating for a separation between global, target, and jtag tap  
namespaces.  Doing do requires a way to know which namespace is being  
used, hence target commands would be prefixed with &quot;target&quot; and jtag  
commands with &quot;jtag&quot;.

&gt;<i> ===================
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> rick&gt;  I assume that by using jtag events you expect to add them.
</I>&gt;<i> Those events exist now - as part of the target system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It wasn't clear that you were trying to use the target events since  
you had specified the target command but used a jtag tap name.

&gt;<i> Look at &quot;target.c&quot; and &quot;target.h&quot; - search for &quot;TARGET_EVENT_*&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We could add jtag events - if we need them.
</I>&gt;<i>

&quot;He said he hadn't had a byte in three days. I had a short, so I split  
it with him.&quot;
