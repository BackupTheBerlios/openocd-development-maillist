It does not really reorder the chain - but it could easily do so.

The idea is this:

(A) there is a linked list of jtag devices. HEAD = global variable: 
&quot;struct jtag_device_t *tag_devices&quot;;

(B) As that list is built - there is an implied order to that list, ie: 
the order it was built.

(C) That inherent order is used by the function: 
   
       struct jtag_device_t *jtag_get_device( int num );

(D)  Remember how the &quot;target became an object&quot; with the earlier change?

    That needs to happen too.

(E) During initial configuration, the &quot;tap object &quot; is given a 
&quot;position&quot; in the chain.

For example - Some ARM926 chips have different internal orders. Others - 
chips like omap/beagleboard have taps that appear and disappear.

Since the &quot;jtag tap&quot; is an object - the &quot;tap objects&quot; in the omap/beagle 
board could be enabled &amp; disabled via their &quot;tap object&quot;

And - well one could do other things with the tap object, for example 
change the order the tap is in by using the &quot;configure&quot; command.

(F) The idea is - Later, when the entire chain must be itterated in some 
order a list is built. That list is *temporary* - and rebuilt again and 
again and again. Why? Incase some body does something weird with the 
'tap object' command - like disable something, or change the order of 
something.


-Duane.
