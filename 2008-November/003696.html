<PRE>snip snip .. [lots of back and forth about beagle board support]

The general idea I had is below.
(Sorry - been quite busy for a while - and lying low)

-Duane.

We had an old &quot;target syntax&quot; - today - we have a new target syntax.
The NEW command - recognizes &amp; converts the old syntax to the new syntax.

=====================

Specifically - the command:

Today:    jtag_device 4 0x1 0xf 0xe

Always adds a new device to the end of the current list.

Tomorrow, becomes a new &quot;jtag&quot; tcl command.

             jtag  newtap NAME  -position N -irlength N  -expected N 
-expected-mask N 

=====================

When converting the old syntax to the new syntax, the &quot;NAME&quot; is created, 
ie: 
Names would be something like    tapfoo0, tapfoo1, tapfoo2 ... etc.

{If  you do not know, this is the same idea as the &quot;tk&quot; button, label, 
etc command}

That &quot;NAME&quot; also becomes a first class command.

=====================

Once created, you could then do anything you want to it. This is 
something that does not exist/work today - why?
Today, the &quot;jtag-device&quot; command always *ADDS* to the list  It never 
*modifies* an existing tap - that is the key thing the beagle solution 
needs.

For example:

          tapfoo configure -irlength 0

Would change the IR register length to 0, or perhaps 

       tapfoo  configure -disable

=============================

Also by the way, there would be other commands, for example:

        tapfoo cget -tapid-expected
and   tapfoo cget -tapid-actual

Would return either the expected or actual tap id found on the chain.

=============================

For example, for an ARM926 target - one could do this with the TCL code

    jtag newtap -name MYARM926 ... blah blah blah ... {setup an arm926}

Then later,

    set x [MYARM926 cget -tapid-actual]

    if { [expr (x &amp; 0x0fff0000) == 0x09260000] } then {
          puts &quot;Yea, we really found an arm926&quot;
   } else {
          set actual [jtag tapid-lookup $x]
         puts [format &quot;This is not an arm926.... I think it is: %s\n&quot; 
$actual]
    }

=============================

We should also be able to do all kinds of tricks with the RESET operation.

For example - we could define &quot;reset&quot; as a tcl script, that - by default 
- does the normal thing for *normal* cpus.

But - for these OMAP beagle boards... It would do things like:

proc beagle_board_reset {
      assert the RESET pin
      # all taps disabled.
      shift X into the IR register
      shift Y into the IR register
       ... blah blah blah ..
}

Then - one could - for example - create a GDB attach event proc.

   eventproc  -event  gdbattach  -command  beagle_board_reset

=============================

What needs to be done - the road map.

1)   The new &quot;tcl jtag&quot; command = needs expanding.

    The &quot;Newtap&quot; command needs to be added.
    It replaces the &quot;handle_jtag_device_command()&quot; function
    And the &quot;jtag_device&quot; command.

    The model is the &quot;target&quot; command.
    specificall, &quot;jim_target()&quot; - target.c - line 3967, the 
&quot;TG_CMD_CREATE&quot; enumeration.
    Which calls &quot;target_create()&quot;

2)    You'll notice that &quot;target_create()&quot; calls &quot;target_configure()&quot; 
about half way through.
    And - at the end, it calls: &quot;Jim_CreateCommand()&quot; - creating the new 
target command.

3) Housekeeping functions.

   We'll need a few other commands - for example:
          Like : CURRENT, and NUMBER, and COUNT
          For the same reason that &quot;target&quot; needs them.

4) A function simular to &quot;tcl_target_func()&quot; - perhaps called 
tcl_tap_func() will need to be created.
    It needs to at least respond to the: &quot;configure&quot; and &quot;cget&quot; commands.
    And - implement the &quot;-enable&quot; and &quot;-disable&quot; commands.
   
5)   The variable:  &quot;struct target-&gt;target_Number&quot; needs to go away.

    Likewise: &quot;get_target_by_number()&quot; must die.
    And its simular reverse functions must die.

    All access changes to &quot;target_by_name()&quot;

    The variable: &quot;struct target-&gt;chain_position&quot; needs to go away
    And be replaced with:  &quot;struct target-&gt;tap_name&quot; as a const char ptr
   
    Likewise, changes to &quot;struct jtag_device_t&quot; needs to happen.
    For example: &quot;jtag_get_device()&quot; needs to die
    And be replaced with:  jtag_get_device_by_name()

6) We need some function -

    jtag_build_device_chain() - which - builds the chain &quot;as it is 
configured today&quot;
    Effectively - dropping or adding a tap based on &quot;enabled&quot; or not.
    Or - if the chain order changes.

    This is needed for example @ jtag.c - line 476
    The &quot;for()&quot; loop that iterates over the devices.

    The idea is this:
          struct jtag_tap_order {
             struct jtag_device_t *this_device;
             struct jtag_tap_order *next_device;
          }

=============================
