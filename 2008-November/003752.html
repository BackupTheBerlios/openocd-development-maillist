<PRE>oyvind&gt; are you keeping two lists? One list for active and one for all taps?

One list. With an &quot;p-&gt;enabled&quot; element.

Duane&gt; 2) There is a ghost variable (that holds the length of the list)

oyvind &amp; rick&gt;  [ this is good for performance ]

Agh... Really? I suspect both of  you have fallen into the &quot;always use 
qsort()&quot; trap. [ie: For small things, it is simpler to do it brute 
force] We are not talking about a list that is 1000 items long, we are 
talking about a list that at most is about 5 to 8 items long. On a 
desktop PC - the &quot;time to count&quot; is measured in microseconds and it 
lives in the cache, and it does not happen that often. Even using 
Zylin's little zy1000 at most it is perhaps 3 to 4 instructions per item 
in the list instructions. So - a couple microseconds.

That is not where the performance problems are.

Duane&gt; [all these indirect index references to positions on the list]
Duane&gt; I believe all of these should become just a &quot;tap pointer&quot;.

oyvind&gt; sounds great from a performance point of view :-)

I view it as a code maintenance and source of bugs problem. - ie: Do 
something the you call some function called 
&quot;update_the_global_variables()&quot; but - you miss one some where.

Duane&gt; [str9 flash may break]
oyvind&gt; [that is ok - we fix it later]

Fine with me.

In fact, I'll put an LOG_ERROR in there and force it to fail error wise 
until it is fixed.

oyvind&gt;  How far are you away from a final plan and when do you think
oyvind&gt; would be a good time to do this?

Plan was generally the churn of emails earlier. Working on it today.


-Duane.
