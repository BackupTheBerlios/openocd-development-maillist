<PRE>Hi Pavel,

I've forwarded your last mail to the list, find my comments below.
It would be nice if others could comment on these issues as well.

&gt;<i> Subject: Re: Some OpenOCD patches
</I>&gt;<i> Date: Friday 06 July 2007
</I>&gt;<i> From: Pavel Chromy &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">chromy at asix.cz</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> To: Dominic Rath &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">Dominic.Rath at gmx.de</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The main aim was to make a solution for programming microcontrollers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; with FLASH memory and to have the programming as fast as possible.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I have made some patches to OpenOCD and created a simple GUI frontend
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; for windows. The GUI application executes OpenOCD and talks through it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to bootloader programming the FLASH at speed about 25 KB/s, which is not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; bad. Later on I am planing to open bootloader interface to public so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that users would be able easily implement programming of virtually any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; part.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not sure why you think moving the flash programming functionality
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; away from OpenOCD is necessary. Programming is already supported for a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wide variety of devices (NXP LPC2xxx, Atmel AT91SAM7, ST Micro STR7x,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; STR9x and STM32, Luminary Steallaris and external CFI compatible devices
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (and some non CFI compatible devices)).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well... as OpenOCD is not a complete debugger, it is more a stub
</I>&gt;<i> requiring external debugger running on top of it, the way I was thinking
</I>&gt;<i> is basically the same approach.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have tested built-in programming of AT91SAM7 and it is terribly slow,
</I>&gt;<i> practically (no offense) unusable. For real usage it is a necessity to
</I>&gt;<i> move the flashing itself to a loader running on the chip,
</I>&gt;<i> which i fact means &quot;move it away from OpenOCD&quot; anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another reason was that I have control over the flashing in the GUI,
</I>&gt;<i> updating progress bar etc...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, this is a first version &quot;to have ARM programming&quot; with rather
</I>&gt;<i> minimal changes to OpenOCD and I do not consider this to be final solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I just timed writing the flash of an Atmel AT91SAM7X256 using a JTAGkey-Tiny 
(FT2232) with &quot;arm7_9 fast_memory_access enabled&quot; and &quot;arm7_9 dcc_downloads 
enabled&quot; (the latter shouldn't matter for AT91SAM7 flashing) and achieved 
about 17KB/s. Writing the 512KB flash of the largest currently available 
AT91SAM7 should take about 30 seconds that way - this isn't great, but 
probably still useable.

For other flashes (LPC2000, STR7x/STR9x/STM32 and external flashes), the 
OpenOCD already downloads the actual flashing algorithm to the target, 
achieving about 60KB or so last time I tried writing a LPC2294.

It would be nice if you could rerun your tests with &quot;arm7_9 
fast_memory_access&quot; enabled to see what kind of performance you're achieving.
If the problem with Presto remains I'm sure we'll be able to work this out, 
for example by adding an algorithm for AT91SAM7 support like we already have 
for STR7x.

&gt;<i> &gt; If this is only for the purpose of allowing an external GUI that possibly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't share filesystem access with the OpenOCD to write the target
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; flash then implementing the vFlashXXX commands would be the right way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a possibility, but there has to be a loader running on the chip
</I>&gt;<i> (to achieve reasonable flashing speed) before the commands are issued.
</I>&gt;<i> Someone/thing has to be responsible for writing the MCU memory and
</I>&gt;<i> starting it - and there is the question: who and how?
</I>&gt;<i> It may be done so that the user (or GUI application) issues load_image
</I>&gt;<i> command and the vFlash* would talk with the loader according
</I>&gt;<i> to protocol well defined for target family or something like that.
</I>&gt;<i> The approach I took is consistent in the meaning that GUI application
</I>&gt;<i> is responsible for both starting the flash loader a communicating with
</I>&gt;<i> it. OpenOCD is just a communication interface in this case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>See above.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; For interfacing PRESTO I have compiled our as DLL exporting necessary
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; functions. There is currently no Linux support for PRESTO - we are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; thinking about that but customers demand is rather low.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have rather strongs objections against linking GPL software against
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; closed source binaries. The only reason why I'm tolerating FTDI's FTD2XX
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is that there's libftdi as a replacement for those who want to stick with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; free and open source software. For the same reason I declined to add
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support for Segger's J-Link.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I understand your position.
</I>&gt;<i> That is why I have not linked OpenOCD directly and used DLL with a
</I>&gt;<i> (well) defined interface (GPL does not prohibit that as I understood).
</I>&gt;<i> This interface might be made generic, allowing usage of JTAG drivers
</I>&gt;<i> compiled as DLLs, which would mean that no further
</I>&gt;<i> patches to OpenOCD would be needed to use &quot;closed&quot; JTAG interfaces.
</I>&gt;<i> That seems like I good idea to me - OpenOCD would not have any reference
</I>&gt;<i> to any particular proprietary JTAG interface - just an option to use
</I>&gt;<i> generic DLL driver.
</I>&gt;<i> This might be pretty fair solution for everyone, what do you think?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>According to my understanding there's no difference whether you implicitly 
link using whatever mechanism your host provides (e.g. the import table 
together with the IAT on windows) or by explicitly calling the dynamic loader 
to resolve symbols during runtime.
The FSF seems to share this position:
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#MereAggregation">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#MereAggregation</A>

What you're recommending is described here:
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#LinkingOverControlledInterface">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#LinkingOverControlledInterface</A>

Allowing this kind of use would require a change of the OpenOCD's license. 
Currently there's no code taken from other projects that I know of, but there 
are already several developers who would have to authorize this license 
change.
Personally I'm against this - what's the opinion of other people monitoring 
this list?

&gt;<i> By the way, PRESTO utilizes an FTDI chip, but not 2232,
</I>&gt;<i> it has FT245 and a CPLD with a proprietary design so even if we opened
</I>&gt;<i> all of the software, there is still the CPLD... The open driver
</I>&gt;<i> for PRESTO would not be any useful without buying PRESTO anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> PRESTO itself is a proprietary solution, that is a fact and
</I>&gt;<i> there is no discussion about that. We make living by creating and
</I>&gt;<i> selling the development tools, and development and support of such tools
</I>&gt;<i> costs a lot of money.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>If the interface used to talk to your hardware was open a user could write 
that Linux/BSD/OSX/... driver you're not providing because of a lack of 
consumer demand - that's one of the major points why I wrote the OpenOCD:
Macraigor's ocdremote and ocdcommander support Wiggler devices only on 
Windows, but not on Linux, so I decided to write my own software that allows 
users to use cheap JTAG hardware on Linux machines.
Of course this is a decision you'll have to make - I don't know how 
sophisticated the Presto interface is.

The same argumentation goes for any other hardware device - of course you wont 
be able to use the driver without the hardware, but if you have the hardware 
you can port the driver to whatever system you want to use it with.

&gt;<i> Surely, I do not insist on having direct PRESTO support in OpenOCD,
</I>&gt;<i> but I see nothing bad in giving users the choice - to have complete
</I>&gt;<i> open source solution with parallel port or FT2232, or buy proprietary
</I>&gt;<i> hardware and configure OpenOCD to talk to a &quot;binary driver&quot; (DLL).
</I>See above - I'm looking for other opinions on this topic - personally I'm 
against this kind of use.

&gt;<i> Technically speaking, no software could be open source from top to
</I>&gt;<i> bottom on Windows. As long OpenOCD is running on Windows, it's
</I>&gt;<i> using closed source API calls anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>This is specifically allowed by an exception in the GPL, section 3:

----
However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.
----

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I have also made some other patches, the most important one are qdcc:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and Qdcc: GDB commands for reading/writing debug communication channel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; for fast interaction with bootloader code from external application.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I couldn't find documentation on the qdcc: and Qdcc: commands anywhere on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the net, and the current GDB sources don't seem to implement this either. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is this something you created, or is it used somewhere else, too?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Packet beginning with Q and q may be vendor defined, this is the case,
</I>&gt;<i> I made this up to expose DCC to the world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>If we're able to resolve the problems you're seeing with the existing AT91SAM7 
flash writing support this shouldn't be necessary anymore.

&gt;<i> &gt; I'll have a closer look at how your JTAG support in presto.c works, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; probably wont have time for this within the next few days.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, thank you. I am looking forward to discussion about this. It seems
</I>&gt;<i> to me a good idea to have simpler interface for drivers. With the
</I>&gt;<i> current &quot;execute_queue&quot; style the drivers are taking care of a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> generic JTAG stuff, which is not necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Could you elaborate on this? The current JTAG subsystem evolved since I 
started writing the OpenOCD, and I believe everything it does now is required 
for one JTAG interface or another.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 4) arm7_9_common.c: added functions arm7_9_dcc_*() for burst read/write
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; of DCC (fast communication with bootloader or similar usage)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There's already arm7_9_bulk_write which uses the DCC. Splitting this into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a generic part and the actual bulk_write is probably a good thing, I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; going to add this change.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The functions I added, tend to offer support for telnet/GDB commands
</I>&gt;<i> controlling DCC. I am not sure whether they wil be useful for
</I>&gt;<i> DCC uploads as they are.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Exposing the DCC via telnet or GDB isn't necessary in my opinion, but 
arm7_9_send_dcc(u32 *data, int size) and arm7_9_receive_dcc(u32 *data, int 
size) would encapsulate the DCC and provide a generic interface that could be 
used by the bulk_write code as well as semihosting functionality for example.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 5) gdb_server.c: added handling of qdcc: and Qdcc:, the extern
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; declarations of arm7_9_dcc_* functions here is a really nasty hack, I am
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; not 100% familiar with all of the target virtualization, any proposal on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; how to do this &quot;the right way&quot;? Need a comment on this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The question is if we really need a way for external applications to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; access the DCC. This completely non-portable, e.g. XScale and Cortex
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; based targets don't have a DCC (XScale has something similar, but this is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not compatible).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, as I stated, comments needed on this, I am not familiar with all
</I>&gt;<i> microcontrollers supported by OpenOCD.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Shall I send a copy of this to the mailing list or would you do it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> oh my god, it is 1:14 am already, so good night ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards
