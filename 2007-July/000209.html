<PRE>Hello list,

This is an email converation between Pavel Chromy and me. As more and more 
people get involved in the OpenOCD development process I figured it would be 
better to discuss these topics on the list.

Regards,

Dominic

Thank you Dominic,

Dominic Rath napsal(a):
&gt;<i> I'll comment on a few of things you wrote right now, but with your 
</I>permission 
&gt;<i> I'd like to move this discussion to the OpenOCD development mailinglist. You 
</I>&gt;<i> can subscribe to the list at 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development</A>
</I>
Sure, I just have subscribed to that list.


&gt;&gt;<i> The main aim was to make a solution for programming microcontrollers with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> FLASH memory and to have the programming as fast as possible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have made some patches to OpenOCD and created a simple GUI frontend for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> windows. The GUI application executes OpenOCD and talks through it to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bootloader programming the FLASH at speed about 25 KB/s, which is not bad.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Later on I am planing to open bootloader interface to public so that users
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be able easily implement programming of virtually any part.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure why you think moving the flash programming functionality away 
</I>&gt;<i> from OpenOCD is necessary. Programming is already supported for a wide 
</I>&gt;<i> variety of devices (NXP LPC2xxx, Atmel AT91SAM7, ST Micro STR7x, STR9x and 
</I>&gt;<i> STM32, Luminary Steallaris and external CFI compatible devices (and some non 
</I>&gt;<i> CFI compatible devices)).
</I>
Well... as OpenOCD is not a complete debugger, it is more a stub
requiring external debugger running on top of it, the way I was thinking 
is basically the same approach.

I have tested built-in programming of AT91SAM7 and it is terribly slow,
practically (no offense) unusable. For real usage it is a necessity to
move the flashing itself to a loader running on the chip,
which i fact means &quot;move it away from OpenOCD&quot; anyway.

Another reason was that I have control over the flashing in the GUI,
updating progress bar etc...

Anyway, this is a first version &quot;to have ARM programming&quot; with rather
minimal changes to OpenOCD and I do not consider this to be final solution.


&gt;<i> If this is only for the purpose of allowing an external GUI that possibly 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't share filesystem access with the OpenOCD to write the target flash 
</I>&gt;<i> then implementing the vFlashXXX commands would be the right way.
</I>
This is a possibility, but there has to be a loader running on the chip
(to achieve reasonable flashing speed) before the commands are issued. 
Someone/thing has to be responsible for writing the MCU memory and 
starting it - and there is the question: who and how?
It may be done so that the user (or GUI application) issues load_image 
command and the vFlash* would talk with the loader according
to protocol well defined for target family or something like that.
The approach I took is consistent in the meaning that GUI application
is responsible for both starting the flash loader a communicating with
it. OpenOCD is just a communication interface in this case.


&gt;&gt;<i> For interfacing PRESTO I have compiled our as DLL exporting necessary
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> functions. There is currently no Linux support for PRESTO - we are thinking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about that but customers demand is rather low.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have rather strongs objections against linking GPL software against closed 
</I>&gt;<i> source binaries. The only reason why I'm tolerating FTDI's FTD2XX is that 
</I>&gt;<i> there's libftdi as a replacement for those who want to stick with free and 
</I>&gt;<i> open source software. For the same reason I declined to add support for 
</I>&gt;<i> Segger's J-Link.
</I>
I understand your position.
That is why I have not linked OpenOCD directly and used DLL with a 
(well) defined interface (GPL does not prohibit that as I understood).
This interface might be made generic, allowing usage of JTAG drivers 
compiled as DLLs, which would mean that no further
patches to OpenOCD would be needed to use &quot;closed&quot; JTAG interfaces.
That seems like I good idea to me - OpenOCD would not have any reference
to any particular proprietary JTAG interface - just an option to use
generic DLL driver.
This might be pretty fair solution for everyone, what do you think?

By the way, PRESTO utilizes an FTDI chip, but not 2232,
it has FT245 and a CPLD with a proprietary design so even if we opened
all of the software, there is still the CPLD... The open driver
for PRESTO would not be any useful without buying PRESTO anyway.
PRESTO itself is a proprietary solution, that is a fact and
there is no discussion about that. We make living by creating and
selling the development tools, and development and support of such tools
costs a lot of money.

Surely, I do not insist on having direct PRESTO support in OpenOCD,
but I see nothing bad in giving users the choice - to have complete
open source solution with parallel port or FT2232, or buy proprietary
hardware and configure OpenOCD to talk to a &quot;binary driver&quot; (DLL).
Technically speaking, no software could be open source from top to
bottom on Windows. As long OpenOCD is running on Windows, it's
using closed source API calls anyway.


&gt;&gt;<i> I have also made some other patches, the most important one are qdcc: and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Qdcc: GDB commands for reading/writing debug communication channel for fast
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interaction with bootloader code from external application.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I couldn't find documentation on the qdcc: and Qdcc: commands anywhere on 
</I>the 
&gt;<i> net, and the current GDB sources don't seem to implement this either. Is 
</I>this 
&gt;<i> something you created, or is it used somewhere else, too?
</I>
Packet beginning with Q and q may be vendor defined, this is the case,
I made this up to expose DCC to the world.


&gt;<i> I'll have a closer look at how your JTAG support in presto.c works, but 
</I>&gt;<i> probably wont have time for this within the next few days.
</I>
Ok, thank you. I am looking forward to discussion about this. It seems 
to me a good idea to have simpler interface for drivers. With the 
current &quot;execute_queue&quot; style the drivers are taking care of a lot of 
generic JTAG stuff, which is not necessary.


&gt;&gt;<i> 4) arm7_9_common.c: added functions arm7_9_dcc_*() for burst read/write of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DCC (fast communication with bootloader or similar usage)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's already arm7_9_bulk_write which uses the DCC. Splitting this into a 
</I>&gt;<i> generic part and the actual bulk_write is probably a good thing, I'm going 
</I>to 
&gt;<i> add this change.
</I>
The functions I added, tend to offer support for telnet/GDB commands 
controlling DCC. I am not sure whether they wil be useful for
DCC uploads as they are.


&gt;&gt;<i> 5) gdb_server.c: added handling of qdcc: and Qdcc:, the extern declarations
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of arm7_9_dcc_* functions here is a really nasty hack, I am not 100%
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> familiar with all of the target virtualization, any proposal on how to do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this &quot;the right way&quot;? Need a comment on this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The question is if we really need a way for external applications to access 
</I>&gt;<i> the DCC. This completely non-portable, e.g. XScale and Cortex based targets 
</I>&gt;<i> don't have a DCC (XScale has something similar, but this is not compatible).
</I>
Well, as I stated, comments needed on this, I am not familiar with all 
microcontrollers supported by OpenOCD.

Shall I send a copy of this to the mailing list or would you do it?

oh my god, it is 1:14 am already, so good night ;-)

Best regards
   Pavel
