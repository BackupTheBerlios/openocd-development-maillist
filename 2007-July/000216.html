Hi All,

here is a patch for which includes a change to gdb_get_packet() gdb_server.c function.
This function, as it is now in revision 180, allows for reception of escaped binary packet content
just for packets starting with 'X'. In case of any other packet it also handles character 0x03 (Ctrl-c)
inside a packet as an interrupt.

The patch changes this behavior to allow reception of escaped binary data in any packet.
This change is necessary for upcoming support of vFlashWrite and maybe some other commands
implemented in the future.
The change also simplifies processing in gdb_get_packet().

Note:
According to GDB documentation, section D.7 &quot;Interrupts&quot; <A HREF="http://sourceware.org/gdb/download/onlinedocs/gdb_33.html#SEC668">http://sourceware.org/gdb/download/onlinedocs/gdb_33.html#SEC668</A>
is is perfectly OK to handle char 0x03 received inside a packet as part of the packet itself rather
than an interrupt signal. This applies to any packet, 'X' is given just as an example.

Citation from GDB doc:
`Ctrl-C', on the other hand, is defined and implemented for all transport mechanisms. It is represented by sending the single byte 0x03 without any of the usual packet overhead described in the Overview section (see section D.1 Overview). When a 0x03 byte is transmitted as part of a packet, it is considered to be packet data and does not represent an interrupt. E.g., an `X' packet (see X packet), used for binary downloads, may include an unescaped 0x03 as part of its packet.

The patch also includes some minor, mainly cosmetic, changes:
jtag/bitq.c, presto.c - reformatted the same way as rest of OpenOCD sources (tabs at the line beginnings instead of spaces)
flash/at91sam7.c - at91sam7_write() test of data exceeding bank size was done twice (code with no effect), formating

I propose this patch to be included in the HEAD revision of OpenOCD.

Pavel
