How about coverage of boards and board-level mechanisms, like 'reset-init'
event handlers to initialize things?

That constraint is present for almost all testing.  :)

He won't be able to do that with boards he doesn't have.  ;)


&gt;<i> &gt; Also worth mentioning: &#160;I think this time we've been better at holding

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now we also have a list of things that are working, so it's easier to

</I>
Yep.  That's part of any systematic approach to testing:  you can
say &quot;these all passed last time, so they've got to pass for this
upcoming release too&quot;.  Requires a stable farm of test hardware.

Of course, there's also value in more ad-hoc testing; it's likely
to uncover different issues.  But using purely ad-hoc testing would
ensure there are significant holes in test coverage.
