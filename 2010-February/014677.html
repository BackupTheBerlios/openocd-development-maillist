Yes, the testing and test design both matter hugely ... well designed
tests matter little if the actual testing is goofy, and great testing
against a weak test plan doesn't help much either.

I think it's good to acknowledge everyone involved.  I don't think I
knew about that involvement from Laurentiu.  Maybe it would have been
better to say &quot;...referring to Zylin's work&quot;.


&gt;<i> Now if the code quality is good, then this sort of effort confirms the quality
</I>&gt;<i> without generating bug reports and I could only wish that these efforts were
</I>&gt;<i> more visible. &#160;What you have seen posted to the list is just the tip
</I>&gt;<i> of the iceberg of the work put in by Edgar &amp; Laurentiu.
</I>
Anyone who's done Real Testing is very much aware of that type
of &quot;iceberg&quot; effect!  :)

As in:  running the tests (perhaps automated) can cover a few
thousands of cases ... yet only turn up a few dozen bugs.
