I use that version from the latest cygwin, to do test builds.

And I just made one ... worked fine.  Are you maybe not using
the current code from the git repository?

That error is a bit bothersome to me ... someone appears to
have gone to some real effort to make that break.  Normally,
a char (signed or unsigned) would automatically be promoted
to an integer, generating no warnings.

My guess is that somebody observed that confusion between
signed and unsigned characters is common, and could cause
problems in various situations if negative indices are used
with pointers where they won't work.  (Problem == various
flavors of memory access error, including &quot;wrong address&quot;;
or maybe data corruption for write accesses.)

Nonetheless, what I've done when I see that in test builds
is to just cast the parameter to &quot;int&quot; (restoring standard
behavior).
