So, for the record, this is a regression

	- since 0.1.0
	- but *NOT* since 0.3.1

Which means:

	* With my release manager's hat on ... we can ship 0.4.0 with
	  this as a &quot;known bug, not yet fixed&quot;, since it's &quot;just&quot;
	  carrying a previous bug forward.  (Though if a fix appears
	  soonish, I'd as soon fix it.)

	* With my developer's hat on ... we should try to find a fix
	  for this ASAP.  Such a fix might be appropriate for an 0.4.1
	  if it appears soon enough.

Had we known about this earlier in the 0.4 cycle it should have merited
some bugfixing attention, so that it would be fixed by now.  The 0.5.x
series should not perpetuate this bug.  The bug report is kind of late
to let this block the 0.4 release ... it should have blocked 0.3 but we
didn't know about it then, so it's got &quot;legacy bug&quot; status.

Someone should file a bug report in Trac, to help make sure this doesn't
get overlooked next time.
