I'd think so.  An &quot;at91&quot; prefix is kind of superfluous.
If we were doing it from scratch, having it might be nice;
but at this point we should bias towards compatibility.

The &quot;sam7...&quot; name doesn't break anything, and it matches
the common usage I've heard.


&gt;<i> Another idea is to follow at91sam7sx.cfg and create a more general file
</I>&gt;<i> named at91sam7sex.cfg for all 3 members of this family. However, the

</I>&gt;<i>  AT91SAM7SE256 0x272A0940
</I>&gt;<i>  AT91SAM7SE512 0x272A0A40
</I>
That's a bit of a problem.  But it's workable by having a common config
file for everything except those IDCODE values ... define the IDCODE
in a chip-specific file, then source the common file.  (You mention
that &quot;common file&quot; strategy later.)

 
&gt;<i> Worse, they come with different RAM sizes and therefore possibly
</I>&gt;<i> different work area layouts.
</I>
Re layout, if the RAM starts at the same location they can likely
default to the same work area layout.  It's not like most downloaded
algorithms need a lot of work area; even just 4K should suffice.

(Though the sam7 flash driver might need minor tweaks, like those
I committed for the Stellaris flash driver a while back, if it's
got any tendancy towards stupidly over-allocating work area.)

I thought Atmel was pretty good about exposing that sizing information
through chip registers.  If the flash driver (the main SoC-specific code)
can autodetect that (some DBGU-related registers?) it should be able to
use a feature that's been discussed a bit:  automagically declaring the
SRAM region, as well as the flash regions.  It's kind of nasty to be
reporting un-educated guesses about SRAM for GDB's memory map...


&gt;<i> Shall we specify all these variants (other devices may have others) in
</I>&gt;<i> each board configuration files?
</I>
That can work, if no better option surfaces.


&gt;<i> Btw. this is also true (or actually wrong) for target/at91sam7sx.cfg,
</I>&gt;<i> which specifies 16k work area size. The AT91SAM7S32 has 8k and the
</I>&gt;<i> AT91SAM7S16 only 4k of RAM. The at91sam7sx is not as general as it claims.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd prefer to create
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  at91sam7se32.cfg
</I>&gt;<i>  at91sam7se256.cfg
</I>&gt;<i>  at91sam7se512.cfg
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Possibly they may then include
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  source [find target/at91sam7sex.cfg]
</I>
As I say, that can work.  Likely it's needed because of the IDCODE issues.
(Bugfixes in that area would still be appropriate for the 0.4 release...)


But shouldn't that be &quot;sam7se&quot;?  The &quot;x&quot; is significant in Atmel's naming
scheme, and &quot;sex&quot; annoys lots of puritanical spam filters.  ;)


By the way ... not that I'd expect Atmel to phase out their sam7 lines
any time soon, but it's interesting that some of their new sam3s chips
are pin-compatible with some of the sam7 chips.  As if they're getting
ready to de-emphasize the arm7tdmi cores in favor of cortex-m3, if their
customers start preferring those newer cores.
