I suspect you're mostly referring to Edgar's work.  I don't think I've
seen evidence of that from anyone else.  :(

Yes, systematic testing to help uncover regressions is really The Way
To Do Things.  I'm not sure how complete our test coverage is, though.

I still have some board tests on my list-of-stuff-to-do, but I did get
most of them done.


Also worth mentioning:  I think this time we've been better at holding
off changes in the RC cycle (and, partly, before that) which didn't address
real problems ... and had somewhat better disciplne about avoiding (and
resolving!) regressions during the merge window.
