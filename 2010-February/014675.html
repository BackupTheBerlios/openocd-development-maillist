One entire category was intentionally left out: commands specific to targets.
The goal of this first attempt of systematic of tests was to prove
that &quot;basic&quot; functionality is there for each of the tested target.
As a constraint, it is necessary that the tests can be easily be ran
and reproduced.

Post them over and I'll make sure to include them in the template and
ask Laurentiu to run them when he gets the chance.

&gt;<i> Also worth mentioning: &#160;I think this time we've been better at holding
</I>&gt;<i> off changes in the RC cycle (and, partly, before that) which didn't address
</I>&gt;<i> real problems ... and had somewhat better disciplne about avoiding (and
</I>&gt;<i> resolving!) regressions during the merge window.
</I>
Now we also have a list of things that are working, so it's easier to
spot regressions.

Regards,
Edgar
