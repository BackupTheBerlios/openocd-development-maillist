Oh there sure is! I call it the devkit business.

Pulling the address out of blink.bin would be great, although it
probably needs to be load_elf blink.elf (which would be pretty cool).

Agreed. Although I'm more thinking &quot;customer&quot; and not &quot;user&quot; --- the
difference is often the &quot;learning&quot; part.

&gt;<i> &gt; There are similar things for loading/running uboot in sheevaplug,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sheevaplug that's probably something you'll want to do a lot. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One thing that's different is that the Sheevaplug stuff is part

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your script on the other hand isn't updating firmware.
</I>
But my board is a dev kit and a routine like this fits into my (the
manufacturer) support story. One difference here is between board and
chip. But since 0x00400000 is where the flash gets mirrored, I feel
this useful to anyone using the mc13224v.

Anyway, that's the best case I can make. Your idea of load_image
pulling the address is better anyway.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are other things you'd want to do a lot; like making GDB do
</I>&gt;<i> that for you.  How do you know which of those things should be in
</I>&gt;<i> scripts that *every* user sees?
</I>
Well, to be fair, I talk to a lot of people using the mc13224v. And
there aren't too many other people supporting them with OpenOCD or
open source. And besides Freescale and CEL, I'm the only other one
selling dev. kits.

Generally I think every snippet or procedure that makes something
easier should be somewhere.  

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Someone else might take it ... but I won't.
</I>
Ok. It's gone then.

Thanks for the help,

-Mar.
