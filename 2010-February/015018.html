Another option is to provide both &quot;enough SRAM&quot; *and* much flash.  :)

Of course, that still costs extra power.  Which can be OK on
development boards where the power budget doesn't much matter.

But in practice, most of that code is read-only and therefore may as
well live in NOR flash so you can execute-in-place.  And not *NEED*
to come up with some kind of segment loader.

 
&gt;<i> Also you get to make the tradeoff between code/data. No more of these

</I>
No question that 4K isn't much R/W memory to pair up with 128K flash.
The 32-bit processors I've looked at which have 128 tend to not be
that parsimonious ... 32K (or more) is a bit more typical there.
