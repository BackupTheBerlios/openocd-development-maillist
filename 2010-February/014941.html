Right.  The current incarnation of my transport-neutrality layer
in the ADIv5 code -- which I'll post in a  while -- continues
the current expectation that such flags are automagically cleared
as part of cleaning up after processing the transaction queue.

That is, JTAG glue would do it the JTAG way (write to CSW), while
SWD glue would do it the SWD way (write to ABORT register).

An alternate strategy would be to have methods on the transport
entity to clear those flags.

(I'll sure be hoping you will give that SWD-related stuff a very
careful review.  I've certainly been looking at the monolithic
patch you sent a while back.  Between us, I expect we should be
able to get serious progress on SWD in this release!!)


&gt;<i> WAITb001 The WAIT response to a DPACC or APACC access on page4-16
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>
Same thing.  But of course, the status handling in that code is
quite a mess.  Regardless, handling the WAIT status clearly needs
to be transport-specific.


&gt;<i> So ADIv5 code should know which mode it's in(JTAG or SWD) to perform

</I>
There's another issue you didn't mention:  DP register addressing
isn't the same.  There's WCR, and CTRLSEL, for one thing ... and
also RESEND vs SELECT.

The same general strategy, I think, applies there too:  all the
operations which would need to access those registers need to be
wrapped in transport-specific methods, so the JTAG code will know
to do one thing, while SWD code knows to do a different thing.
