<PRE>Hi Again,

 

I'm trying to determine if I have defective HW from this problem or
something that can be resolved.  I took a look at the JTAG signals with my
logic analyzer and here's what I got.  Please refer to enclosed screenshots.
Signals are listed from top to bottom-TCK , RTCK , TMS , TDI, TDO , nTRST ,
nRST.

 

When I startup the openocd daemon I see TCK start an 800uSec period approx
1sec after nTRST.  This is followed by a 6.36mS pulse from TDI on a 27.7mSec
period.  No activity on RTCK or TDO.

 

When I issue reset from the telnet window I see nTRST go low and approx
1.5mSec later nRST go low and TDO goes high for the duration of nRST.
There's another blip from TDO slightly later.  No activity on any other
lines.

 

When I issue jtag arp_init I see a couple of pulse from TCK and TMS followed
by a delay and then a block of TCK pulses, a block of TDI pulses and a TMS
pulse and the beginning and end of this block.  No activity from other
lines.

 

I've captured several seconds of activity and never see RTCK leave the low
state.  The ARM7TDMI-S doc mentions on p5-10 that the &quot;off-chip device
issues a TCK signal and waits for the RTCK signal to come back&quot;, but I don't
see this happening.

 

Also, the Multi-ICE System Design Considerations AN72 mentions on p4-6 that
if &quot;VTref goes below approx 0.85V, Multi-ICE interprets this condition as
Target Not Present&quot;.  According to the schematic, the Olimex board ties both
VREF and VTARGET (JTAG pins 1 and 2) to VDD.  I checked them with a meter
and see that they are both 3V28.

 

The Olimex ARM-USB-OCD JTAG unit initially worked beautifully with flashing
and gdb debugging using OpenOCD V040.  The problem started with the failed
flash download.

 

Is the lack of RTCK activity a problem?  When should I be seeing RTCK?

 

I only see brief TDO activity after the reset command.  When should I be
seeing TDO?

 

Is there any other line activity I should be looking for?

 

Any help would be sincerely appreciated.

 

Respectfully,

 

John Alfredo

Subject: [Openocd-development] Error: JTAG scan chain interrogation
failed:all zeros

 

Hi All,

 

I picked up a thread thru google.com that mentions the &quot;interrogation
failed&quot; error, and am having that problem myself.

 

 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.mail-archive.com/openocd-development@lists.berlios.de/msg08501.h">http://www.mail-archive.com/openocd-development@lists.berlios.de/msg08501.h</A>

I'm using an Olimex ARM-USB-OCD dongle on an Olimex lpc2148 (the little
header board) running openocd v0.4.0 on ubuntu 8.04.  I was initially able
to flash the board with a small test program (1344 bytes) and debug with ddd
using 

 

openocd -f interface /olimex-arm-usb-ocd.cfg -f board/olimex_lpc_h2148.cfg

 

However, when I tried to flash the board with a larger program (126408
bytes), the flashing failed (I didn't save the errors), and for every
subsequent command issued I got

 

Command handler execution failed

In procedure 'reset' called at file &quot;command.c&quot;, line 637

Called at file &quot;command.c&quot;, line 352

 

Here's the flash script

halt

arm7_9 dcc_downloads enable

wait_halt

sleep 10

poll

mdw 0x0 100

flash probe 0

flash protect_check 0

# erase first bank only:

flash erase_sector 0 0 26

mdw 0x0 100

flash write_bank 0 lpc2148demo.bin 0x0

mdw 0x0 100

reset halt

sleep 10

#shutdown

 

This script has worked numerous times with the smaller program.   After
restarting the openocd daemon and power cycling the lpc2148 (and totally
rebooting everything) I always get

 

Sudo openocd -f interface/olimex-arm-usb-ocd.cfg -f
board/olimex_lpc_h2148.cfg

Error: JTAG scan chain interrogation failed: all zeroes

Error: Check JTAG interface, timings, target power, etc.

Command handler execution failed

Warn : jtag initialization failed; try 'jtag init' again.

 

If I call 'jtag init' in the telnet window it returns &quot;jtag init has already
been called&quot;, however I'm still not able to issue any commands without the
above error.

 

Also, it does not appear that flash memory on the lpc2148 actually changed
because the previous code is still running-a blinking LED from a timer
interrupt and another LED responding to buttons via an ISR. However if I try
to issue &quot;mdw 0x0 32&quot;  to see what flash looks like I get the &quot;Command
handler execution failed&quot; error above.  Every command returns this error,
including poll.

 

Is it possible the JTAG registers on the lpc2148 or the ARM-USB_OCD got
jammed somehow?  I'm not convinced the lpc2148 is bad since the previous
program is running, however I'm not able to do anything via JTAG with
openocd.

 

How do I get this working again?  Is there a minimal command I can issue to
verify that openocd can in fact talk to the lpc2148?  Any help would be
sincerely appreciated.

 

Respectfully,

 

John Alfredo
