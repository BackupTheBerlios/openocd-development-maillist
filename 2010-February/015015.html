Patches need two kinds of descriptive metadata:

	- one-line summary ... $SUBJECT
	- patch description

The $SUBJECT should make sense when for example scanning the gitweb
summary of what changes have been made.  But since it has no details,
it's insufficient for anything except tracking broadly what changed.
In this case, it doesn't even identify who makes the chip or why any
OpenOCD user might care.

</I>
THat was my attempt at a decent description.   When combined with
the &quot;add target/...cfg&quot; summary, folk now have some real information.
In particular it mentions the unusual boot scheme:  the flash isn't
&quot;on-chip&quot; NOR (with execute-in-place) but &quot;in-package&quot; serial (which
needs to be shadowed into a relatively large SRAM).

I don't entirely &quot;get&quot; these chips which execute code from large SRAMs
instead of from NOR flash ... I had understood that the SRAMs use more
power than the NOR flash, so that most microcontrollers minimized the
quantity of SRAM they included (even at the cost of annoying the folk
writing code that might like more SRAM).

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; +proc run {file} {
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; +     puts &quot;loading $file into location 0x00400000 and executing...&quot;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; +     load_image $file 0x00400000
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; +     reg pc 0x00400000
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; +     resume
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; +}
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's specific to your work environment; don't include it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in a file that's intended to be general purpose.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's a handy procedure for anyone using the mc13224v to run an
</I>&gt;<i> images. Is there anyway to include it or something like it?
</I>
Well, &quot;handy&quot; doesn't seem sufficient to require everyone using this
chip to have that.

This is however also sufficiently obvious (though I'd just &quot;halt&quot;)
that most OpenOCD users should be able to whip that up easily.


&gt;<i> Are you worried about &quot;run&quot; interfering with some other name or do you
</I>&gt;<i> not like that it always goes to 0x00400000? 
</I>
Those are both issues.  But more to the point, not everyone using
OpenOCD will need or want that ... and anyone who does need it
can easily craft their own.

That's more or less just a variant of a script already included in
the User's Guide:  section 5.5 &quot;Project-Specific Utilities&quot;, the
very first script.  (You could &quot;resume 0x00400000&quot; and that would
be just a bit more concise.)
