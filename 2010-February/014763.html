You may also install nvidia driver from ports (
/usr/ports/x11/nvidia-driver or search with cd /usr/ports; make
quicksearch key=&quot;nvidia&quot;) - it was newer than on the official nvidia
website when Ive tried it :-)

You know, FreeBSD is very clean and logical but pretty raw system - if
something is not working, then you did not do something right, not the
system - unlike Linux the BSD will not do anything for you without
your knowledge (its like Slacware against Ubuntu). If you have all of
the drivers and packages installed maybe HAL and DBUS is not enabled
to work in /etc/rc.conf search for:
dbus_enable=&quot;YES&quot;
hald_enable=&quot;YES&quot;

If you have installed the GDM package, then the only thing to place in
/etc.rc.conf is to enable the gdm and it will take care of everything
else (HAL/DBUS):
gnome_enable=&quot;YES&quot;

</I>
Sorry, I dont have these cables, previously I was using also FT2232(C
I think) chip with the LPC2148 board...


&gt;<i> Yes I have installed the binary libftdi and openocd for FreeBSD 8.
</I>&gt;<i> But I am more interested to be able to build latest git version
</I>&gt;<i> of OpenOCD. For that it seems to fail with the stock libftdi.
</I>
Well, in FreeBSD you don't build the packages yourself from scratch -
this is the reason that Ports exists - to be able to build the package
from source with some options enabled/disabled, but the OS specific
quirks are done by the maintainer. Also no development or unstable
package can be considered as stable (ie. my last cdrutils troubles).
But I think this might be a good idea to create openocd-devel port if
thats what you need, Ill think about it and check if its possible to
build straight from the git repository :-)


&gt;<i> Anyway, I think I will only use this FreeBSD installation as
</I>&gt;<i> a test system. It seems to me everything is a bit more difficult
</I>&gt;<i> than Ubuntu and I am not that interested in messing with
</I>&gt;<i> the OS any more (but occasionally I still do).
</I>
Well, maybe not difficult, but different at first glance. Then it is
even more simple because you get the basics right once, and use them
for years - here the internal organization does not change as fast as
in other operating systems :-)

Best regards,
Tomek
