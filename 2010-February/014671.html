This patch addressees a different issue than the bug report you
filed (which seems to me to be a clear case of flakey config
scripts).  This patch addresses a *secondary* failure, which
can crop up in other cases ... even you first observed it with
a bad config script, which permitted a bad JTAG clock setting
during reset.

The patch scans OK, except that &quot;i&quot; is a bad name. &quot;loop_count&quot;
would be more clear.  (And the description is weak, since
the problem isn't coupled to reset or jtag clocks.)

While you're thinking about it, you might consider a quick audit
of  at least the ARM11 code to catch any other such &quot;spin forever&quot;
loops to fix...

It's a general rule that *ALL* &quot;spin until hardware reports
success&quot; loops need timeouts.  Exceptions are rare, and mostly
seem to revolve around &quot;if the hardware is that broken there
is no recovery possible&quot;.  If the loop is in OpenOCD, then a
recovery is almost certainly possible.



&gt;<i> The arm11 target has only recently become robust enough to
</I>&gt;<i> recommend for mortals,
</I>
&quot;Oh, What Fools These Mortals Be!&quot;  ;)

I wouldn't disagree ... but it's still kind of messy, as
well as incomplete.  Thumb support is weak, no semihosting,
no soft breakpoints, and so forth.

There's also quite a lot more scope for sharing code
between ARM11 and Cortex-A cores.  Debug entry/exit can
be much more similar, for example.


&gt;<i> so bugfixes weigh in more heavily than 
</I>&gt;<i> regression concerns for this target, IMO.
</I>
If you mean &quot;potential regressions&quot;, that seems almost
fair ... though we've not yet been deferring bugfixes on
grounds of &quot;potential&quot; trouble.

As for *actual* regressions ... I don't think there should
be any kind of &quot;ARM11 exception&quot;, to count regressions for
those cores any less than for other cores.

Our basic goal in successive releases is to *improve*
things.  Releasing with unfixed regressions is ungood.
