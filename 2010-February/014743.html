<PRE>Hello David!

On Sun, Feb 14, 2010 at 12:11 AM, David Brownell &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">david-b at pacbell.net</A>&gt; wrote:
&gt;&gt;<i> I finally got for better testing if 0.4.0-RC1, there are no big issues

</I>
Sure thing! I am waiting for the RC2 :-)
As for now I had tested once more build process, this time it was
automated with port Makefile build system - I had to apply only the
patch mentioned before (__FREEBSD__) + the appropriate define added to
the compiler.


&gt;<i> Hmm, we're not really set up to have BSD-specific naming
</I>&gt;<i> conventions. &#160;It'll have to stay that way for now. &#160;You
</I>&gt;<i> can resolve that by downloading to a different filename.
</I>
I have unpacked renamed and packed again into a different filename to
remove the &quot;-&quot; mark :-)


&gt;&gt;<i> -The issue with FT2232H should now be resolved as few days ago
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> libftdi-0.17 port was released upon my request. I will report more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> detailed testing soon :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, the 0.17 version is supposed to be better all around
</I>&gt;<i> for the FT2232H stuff.
</I>
Yeah, especially it was 0.14 here :-)

&gt;&gt;<i> -I have problems with compilation of the cable drivers that use linux
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specific drivers (mainly parallel port routines and malloc): PARPORT,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What's the malloc() issue? &#160;It's rare to have portability problems
</I>&gt;<i> with calls to that routine ..
</I>



&gt;<i> FreeBSD does have parport support though, right? &#160;Is the issuse that
</I>&gt;<i> it doesn't work at all with OpenOCD? &#160;Or instead, that it can work
</I>&gt;<i> given some changes?
</I>
Yes sure, but I have abandoned this type of port some years ago when I
had problems with my super-advanced-memory-programmer-ECP-only so I
gave up in favour of the USB/Ethernet stuff... but I still remember
playing with LEDs on Amiga's parallel port ~15 years ago hahah :-)


&gt;<i> A loadFile() call sounds more like a Win32-ism than something
</I>&gt;<i> a Real Operating System would use. &#160;;)
</I>
Im not sure, but remember this thing caused troubles before, so it is
commented out and unavailable to select at config prompt :P


Best regards! :-)
