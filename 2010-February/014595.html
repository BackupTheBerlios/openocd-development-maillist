<PRE>Hi Dimitar

I have the lastest firmware install. I have the latest openocd source from the git repository.
I managed to build openocd.  It now connects to the arm-jtag-ew but,  I can't seem to capture the processor.
It does a reset but not much of anything else.  I read the note about the RTCK mode problem but I don't know
enought about it to fix it.  Also what is the error &quot;Translation from jtag_speed to khz not implemented&quot; mean and
do I need to fix it?

 
here is my output:

I would suggest to make sure you have the latest firmware installed into the 
device. Simply download the latest driver from olimex.com and use the included 
tool to upgrade the firmware.

</I>&gt;<i> Given the right &quot;in&quot;, &quot;reverse engineering&quot; might not be needed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regardless, as original author of that code, I've cc'd him to be
</I>&gt;<i> sure he's aware of this reported problem on MS-Windows (modulo
</I>&gt;<i> problems with too-much-email-to-read-it-all).
</I>
Unfortunately I don't have hardware to test right now. I could try to help, 
however, if someone posts USB comm dump, e.g. by the usbmon linux driver. Or 
better yet, a dump from HW USB analyzer.

&gt;<i> &gt; There are different firmware version for the J-link. They even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use different endpoints and supported command set are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not always the same. Maybe this is the case for Olimex
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Arm-Jtag-EW as well. In that case, even if the original support
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is good, it may not be good for yours.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But the arm-jtag-ew driver isn't the same as the jlink driver...
</I>Correct.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The first thing to check is the USB Descriptors. You can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; post yours. Probably the original author of the patch can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compare yours with his.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Under Windows, you can use usbview to post the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; USB descriptors.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Please note that there is a known issue with RTCK mode. You can disable it 
altogether (fastest), or try to configure around the arm-jtag-ew HW quirk. You 
just have to take into account that is TDI delayed by 3 cycles by the arm-
jtag-ew output.  A possible workaround is to introduce 3 artificial devices on 
the JTAG chain with 1 bit IR lenght and 1 bit DR bypass registers. The driver 
source has a comment on this issue.

Dimitar
