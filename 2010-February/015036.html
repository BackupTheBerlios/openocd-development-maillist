<PRE>I've been using a svn snapshot version (from last summer) of openocd on 
linux with Olimex-arm-usb-ocd device and another guy is using same 
version that I built for windows with jlink. Unfortunately, the jlink 
failed and now he is using our spare Olimex-arm-usb-ocd in its place. He 
also upgraded to Freddie Chopin's 0.3.1 windows build that he has on his 
site (thanks, Freddie!).

The problem is kind of trivial, but we are unsure how to cleanly install 
the needed drivers on 32-bit XP. He has it working after installing the 
libusb0.sys driver (provided by Freddie via his *.inf) but every time he 
reboots or plugs in the Olimex usb device, a windows &quot;new hardware&quot; 
event occurs and the dialog to install new drivers pops up.

With the olimex device plugged in, under Device Manager we see several 
relevant entries:

LibUSB-Win32 Devices
	Olimex ARM-USB-OCD (Channel A)
? Other Devices
	? Olimex OpenOcd JTAG
Universal Serial Bus Controller
	USB Composite
	USB Composite

The first one looks like the correct and functional driver that uses 
libusb0.sys and libusb0.dll.

The ones under Universal Serial Bus Controller come and go as the Olimex 
USB is plugged and un-plugged and are Microsoft Drivers. I don't know 
what these do.

So the one with the yellow question marks are probably the problem. If I 
delete it or disabled it it comes back on the next h/w scan. When I try 
to install the driver using the *.inf that Freddie supplied, I see a 
windows error dialog stating something like &quot;driver does not describe 
your hardware&quot;.

We are not using the serial port built into the Olimex. However, if I 
understand right, the code for that (libftdi) is directly linked into 
openocd. Or is it a separate dll?

Any advice on how to resolve this would be appreciated.
