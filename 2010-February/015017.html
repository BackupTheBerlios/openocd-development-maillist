Yeah, after working with it I actually really like just running out of
RAM. You don't have to flash everytime to test something. Also your
&quot;code space&quot; is limitless if you come up with an elf loader or
some other kind of swapping/virtual memory thing (no MMU though).

Also you get to make the tradeoff between code/data. No more of these
128KB flash things with only 4KB of SRAM. Now you get 96KB of SRAM ---
and you can slice it up however you want.

And of course, the real benefit of the mc13224v is that it's an ARM7,
with a fully integrated 802.15.4 radio (balun and everything, just add
a PCB trace for the antenna), and loads of RAM: for under $5.
 
&gt;<i> Well, &quot;handy&quot; doesn't seem sufficient to require everyone using this
</I>&gt;<i> chip to have that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is however also sufficiently obvious (though I'd just &quot;halt&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> that most OpenOCD users should be able to whip that up easily.
</I>
Nope. Only obvious if you've used OpenOCD a lot before. Most people
get a new board, plug it in/hook it up and run openocd and say &quot;now
what?&quot;. It would be very nice to say back: &quot;type mc1322x_run
blink.bin&quot;.

&gt;<i> Those are both issues.  But more to the point, not everyone using
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD will need or want that ... and anyone who does need it
</I>&gt;<i> can easily craft their own.
</I>
Well, we are only talking about mc13224v.cfg users here --- and I'm
pretty sure everyone of them is going to want that routine.

There are similar things for loading/running uboot in sheevaplug,
openrd. What's so special about uboot.bin? The answer is that it's
handy to just type 'sheevaplug_reflash_uboot_env' and if you have a
sheevaplug that's probably something you'll want to do a lot. 

The same is true here. If you are working with an mc13224v you are
going to want to load an image to location 0x00400000 and run it --- a
lot.

But look, if it means you guys won't take it then I won't include
it. If that's the case though it would be nice to have a place for
these sorts of &quot;handy&quot; and more UI oriented routines. 

&gt;<i> (You could &quot;resume 0x00400000&quot; and that would
</I>&gt;<i> be just a bit more concise.)
</I>
Thanks.

-Mar.
