Hmm, no comments yet.  It's almost as if the folk who know about
any part of this haven't had a chance to digest it yet.  :)

I'll hold off till Monday ... or longer, if some comments come
along which need to be addressed.

I think Simon has looked longest, and most effectively, at SWD
support for OpenOCD.  But Spen is also I think quite familiar
with the ADIv5 infrastructure, and there are also a few other
folk with something more than vague familiarity with it.


&gt;<i> &#160;1 Add a new new interface abstracting DAP operations,

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;2 Switch to one of the operations in the new interface,

</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;exposed
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;3 Similarly for the two DP operations (register read/write);
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;this is internal to the ADIv5 code
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;4 And for the AP operations (register r/w) ... this is mostly
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;but not completely internal to ADIv5
</I>

Also ... I'm not sure I said it before, but the abstract DAP operations
accessed in patches #3 and #4 are close matches to SWD protocol operations.

So for those not very fluent in ADIv5, the way to understand what these
patches enable is to imagine those calls just going out over SWD, instead
of through JTAG operations using the APACC and DPACC scan chains.
