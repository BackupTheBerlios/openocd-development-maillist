</I>
There's a business in chip-specific LED-blinking systems??  ;)

To the extent that wanting to do something quickly is a common goal,
I'd say such answers shouldn't be specific to any processor or board,

If the docs are unclear that &quot;load_image blink.bin&quot; followed
by &quot;resume &lt;address&gt;&quot; is a good first step, then we should fix
those docs.  (Including pulling the &lt;address&gt; out of &quot;blink.bin&quot;..


&gt;<i> &gt; Those are both issues. &#160;But more to the point, not everyone using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OpenOCD will need or want that ... and anyone who does need it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can easily craft their own.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, we are only talking about mc13224v.cfg users here --- and I'm
</I>&gt;<i> pretty sure everyone of them is going to want that routine.
</I>
Maybe.  I really do have a hard time believing that telling them
to type two lines instead of one will hurt anyone ... however,
if the two lines are fully documented, but the one isn't, I think
the users will learn more easily from the two-line answer.



&gt;<i> There are similar things for loading/running uboot in sheevaplug,
</I>&gt;<i> openrd. What's so special about uboot.bin? The answer is that it's
</I>&gt;<i> handy to just type 'sheevaplug_reflash_uboot_env' and if you have a
</I>&gt;<i> sheevaplug that's probably something you'll want to do a lot. 
</I>
One thing that's different is that the Sheevaplug stuff is part
of the board-specific stuff and fits into the board manufacturer's
support story.  Like how to upgrade it with the latest firmware.

Your script on the other hand isn't updating firmware.


&gt;<i> The same is true here. If you are working with an mc13224v you are
</I>&gt;<i> going to want to load an image to location 0x00400000 and run it --- a
</I>&gt;<i> lot.
</I>
There are other things you'd want to do a lot; like making GDB do
that for you.  How do you know which of those things should be in
scripts that *every* user sees?

 
&gt;<i> But look, if it means you guys won't take it then I won't include
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>

Someone else might take it ... but I won't.


&gt;<i> If that's the case though it would be nice to have a place for 
</I>&gt;<i> these sorts of &quot;handy&quot; and more UI oriented routines. 
</I>
I referenced the section of the User's guide which talks about
such project-specific developer utilities.  Most developers start
to collect a set of things which fit into their particular work
patterns ... and a good place for them is in &quot;openocd.cfg&quot; for
that projet, or their own script library.

&gt;<i> &gt; (You could &quot;resume 0x00400000&quot; and that would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be just a bit more concise.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks.
</I>&gt;<i>
