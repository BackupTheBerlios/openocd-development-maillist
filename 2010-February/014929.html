<PRE>Archives are in the Berlios and SourceForge &quot;files&quot; areas.

Mainline git is now tagged as &quot;0.5.0-dev&quot;; the merge window
is open.  If we need a bugfix release, it'll branch off from
the commit with the &quot;0.4.0&quot; tag.

I've committed a few patches from my pending queue, most
notably:

 - Making the ARMv7m stuff use &quot;struct arm&quot; so that
   the Cortex-M semihosting support can use most of
   the existing semihosting code (except for the small
   bit which will need to know it's using a different
   entry mechanism

 - The &quot;cleanup&quot; portion of the ADIv5 work, which will
   help with the SWD support.  (Sanity checked on both
   M3 and A8 Cortex cores.)

We're not sure who will be release manager for 0.5.0 ... but
we do know it's someone else's turn!!  If we keep to the kind
of schedule we've had so far, one might anticipate this release
ships no sooner than the end of April.

I'm not sure what else will be merging soon.  There are some
feature patches which have been posted to the list, and held
until the 0.5 window.  And Spen has a bunch of performance
work upcoming too (not all for MIPS, ISTR).  Clearly we want
to see major progress on SWD during this release cycle ... but
it's not ready yet, and I'm not sure what other stuff will be
happening.  I guess this means 0.5.0 will surprise us all!  :)

- Dave
