That would be an 0.5 thing too.  :)

I'm not sure it's appropriate to assume, at an architectural or
infrastructural level, that it's always &quot;light&quot;.  And even if we
could, that type of side effect can cause trouble.

However I *would* like the symmetry of knowing that both &quot;check&quot;
operations behave the same way in all notable respects.  They seem
to have started out that way ... but got out of sync when the flash
sector struct stopped tracking erase status (in part because the
firmware can change it).


By the way ... if STR7 can't actually read the protect status from
the hardware, why does that flash driver have a str7x_protect_check()
method which pretends to do exactly that, instead of just printing
a warning that the status can't be read?
