Many projects use the x.y.z version numbering scheme.  X is the major  
version, Y is the minor, and Z is the patch level.  The idea is that a  
change that breaks compatibility in a major way or an architectural  
change causes the major version to be incremented.  New features and/ 
or enhancements that don't break compatibility or change the  
architecture significantly result in the minor version being  
incremented.  Bug fixes with no significant feature set change result  
in a patch level increment.

For OpenOCD, you can think of 0.1 as 0.1.0.  The implication is that  
the code base doesn't have a stable architecture so the major version  
is 0.  It is the first release in the 0.y.z series, so the minor is  
set to 1 and the patch level to 0.  As bugs are fixed, subsequent  
releases will have the patch level incremented.  If a new feature or  
enhancement is introduced, the minor version is incremented.  Once the  
architecture and config file syntax settles down, the first stable  
release can be made and the major version will be set to 1.

Java actually follows this pattern for their versioning, but it tracks  
the language rather than the VM or support libraries.  Since Java has  
not had a major design change to the language, the major version is  
still 1.  There have been new features introduced, so the minor  
version has changed over the years (currently 1.6).  The patch level  
has also been incremented regularly as they do bugfix releases.  Where  
it gets confusing is that they chose a different marketing version  
from the release version.  Java 6 is really release version Java 1.6.z.

The Linux kernel has been bad about following their versioning  
scheme.  The major version is stuck at 2.y.z because there has not  
been a significant major design or architecture change.  The minor  
version does change but they seem to do so when they feel like it  
rather than when major features are introduced.  The patch level  
changes for each release even if it sometimes contains new features or  
major enhancements.

I would be perfectly happy to use the x.y.z versioning scheme.  As I  
suggested above, I'd start with 0.1.0 and update the numbers as  
appropriate for each release.  We would eventually get to 1.0.0, but  
only once we are comfortable with declaring the architecture and  
config syntax are stable.
