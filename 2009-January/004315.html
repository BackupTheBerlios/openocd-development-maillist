<PRE>Ok, I think perhaps it is working.  I'll have to do some further
testing to determine if this is indeed the case, but I did figure out
some things, I think.

Ok, I've grabbed the latest version from SVN, installed the latest
FTDI drivers (libftd2xx 3.0.18), and sucessfully built OpenOCD under
Cygwin.

Also, I have &quot;-d 3&quot; on the command line, so I'm not sure that
'debug_level 3' is necessary in the config file.  However, I did
switch over to a monolithic configuration file that includes the
&quot;standard&quot; ones.  Here's the configuration file I am using:

========= Begin openocd.cfg =============
debug_level 3

# Use the Olimex JTAG Tiny A
source [find interface/olimex-jtag-tiny-a.cfg]

# Set the telnet port
telnet_port 4444

# Set the GDB port
gdb_port 3333

# Slow down the JTAG
jtag_khz 1500

# Connect to an LPC2148
set CPUTAPID 0x4f1f0f0f
source [find target/lpc2148.cfg
========= End openocd.cfg =============

I found I had to slow down the JTAG in order to get a consistent
readback of the tap/device.  If I use the default JTAG speed, I get a
readback of XXXX.  But when I slow it down to about 1.5MHz or less, it
consistently reads 0x4f1f0f0f.  This is parsed out as manufacturer:
0x787, Part: 0xf1f0, and Version: 0x4.  So first of all, the JTAG
speed is an issue.

Secondly, I noticed that the lpc2148.cfg file defaults to a CPUTAPID
of 0xffffffff, which I think is incorrect.  So I put in the CPUTAPID I
read back, and that seems to fix things.

So, I'm glad to discover that thusfar there is no board problems.
Though apparently the default JTAG speed is too fast.  I don't know
how to clean that up other than to use a shorter ribbon cable.  But
wigglers I've used on Freescale and Xilinx parts can run the JTAG
chain at 15MHz+ without any issues with long ribbon cables.  Then
again, I didn't design those boards :).

Just a few of final questions.

1.  How does one determine the proper CPUTAPID value for the
&quot;-expected_id&quot;?  Is this a trial and error thing?
2.  Why does the LPC2148 configuration file default CPUTAPID to
0xffffffff, when other targets have specific CPUTAPID values (i.e.
at91, zy1000, etc)?  Can the LPC2148 have a different expected id?
2.  Do people have to reduce their JTAG speeds, even for the Olimex
boards?  I copied mine from the Olimex schematic, and there weren't
any terminators, etc.  Should there be some series terminations to
help?

Thanks,
Pete
