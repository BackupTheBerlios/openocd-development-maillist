<PRE>Hi Sergey,

Can you please send your patches to OpenOCD? Even if it is not working
correctly your patch base help other people who wants to test it.

&gt;<i> 1. It does not have TRST, only SRST, and it works (resets), but then
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD is unable to talk to it anymore, full restart of openocd and
</I>&gt;<i> board reset button press works to some extent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. halt works only first time, then the same problem is as with reset.
</I>&gt;<i> Startup process and limitations is not described in manual.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now I have managed to make GPIO and SPI work via mww,
</I>&gt;<i> can write stuff to internal RAM and run it, so basically it works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could anybody advice how to debug/gather information to fix this issue?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I could provide -d3 log of openocd, but it just tells that chip is in
</I>&gt;<i> invalid mode.
</I>&gt;<i> (will submit in another email as soon as I get home).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

I am also testing Freescale ARM9/11 processors with OpenOCD.
Sometimes I got this &quot;invalid mode&quot; error message from OpenOCD and
sometimes I got also this warning message:

Warn : captured: 0x00 check_value: 0x01 check_mask: 0x0f
Warn : in_handler: w/o &quot;in_value&quot;, mismatch in SIR

&gt;<i> Freescale chose strategy of making very hard to work with this chip,
</I>&gt;<i> demanding closed binaries every now and then, and depending on
</I>&gt;<i> IAR Workbench for closed libraries, etc, but I'd like to
</I>&gt;<i> make it work fully (at least as just controller) hoping to reverse engineer
</I>&gt;<i> the rest for proper gcc support, because it is only integrated chip
</I>&gt;<i> on market at the moment, and I'd like to experiment with this kind of stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> By any chance if anybody had any experience with this particular chip,
</I>&gt;<i> have any information, I'd like to know about it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Please go ahead! It is nice to see open-source alternatives to closed solution.
Be sure your work will help more people.

&gt;<i> Thanks a lot.
</I>&gt;<i> S.
</I>
Best Regards,

Alan
