<PRE>I've been trying to use USBprog hardware to do JTAG debugging of a US
Robotics USR8200 router. This is an XScale target, specifically the IXP422
processor. I know from other people that openocd works with this target with
a different JTAG adapter.

The communications with the board initially works, and the Manufacturer ID
is read out correctly, but things go wrong after a reset is issued. The
messages visible on the telnet console are:

&gt;<i> reset halt
</I>JTAG tap: ixp42x.cpu tap/device found: 0x19277013 (Manufacturer: 0x009,
Part: 0x9277, Version: 0x1)
JTAG Tap/device matched
TAP ixp42x.cpu:
value captured during scan didn't pass the requested check:
captured: 0x7f check_value: 0x01 check_mask: 0x7f
in_handler: w/o &quot;in_value&quot;, mismatch in SIR
JTAG error while writing DCSR
BUG: keep_alive() was not invoked in the 1000ms timelimit. GDB alive packet
not sent! (5357)
TAP ixp42x.cpu:
value captured during scan didn't pass the requested check:
captured: 0x07 check_value: 0x02 check_mask: 0x06
in_handler: with &quot;in_value&quot;, mismatch in SDR
TAP (unknown):
value captured during scan didn't pass the requested check:
captured: 0x01 check_value: 0x00 check_mask: 0x01
in_handler: w/o &quot;in_value&quot;, mismatch in SDR
JTAG error while reading TX
error while polling TX register, reset CPU
target state: halted

What seems to be happening, having traced both the USB traffic and the JTAG
traces on a logic analyser, is that the reset starts by resetting both SRST
and TRST, then reading the ManID, sending command 0x9 (DCSR?), sending 0x2,
and getting the right response, sending command 0x7f (Bypass?), again with
the right response.

Then SRST is asserted on it's own, and xscale_deassert_reset() calls
jtag_add_runtest(2030, TAP_IDLE), and then xscale_write_dscr(target, 1, 0).
What is seen on the USB trace and logic trace is toggling of TCK, then a TAP
transition of 2B is sent, to do IDLE -&gt; IRSHIFT, but then the write of
command 0x9 (DCSR?) returns not 1 as expected, but 0x7f.

This implies that the TAP is not in the correct state at that point. This
must be localised to src/jtag/usbprog.c, as other adapters work.

I wonder if the fact that 2030 transitions of TCK end with the TCK low,
interacts badly with the way the &quot;write tms chain&quot; instruction works on the
USBprog? It takes TCK low then high, to do each transition, but if TCK is
already low at the end of the runtest, one of the transitions would be lost,
and the 2B would instead end up as 15, and we'd end up in DRSHIFT, not
IRSHIFT. This would be consistent with the read out of 0x7F.

Thoughts? What state should TCK be in &quot;normally&quot; - between operations? I'm a
little reticent about just putting in a change and trying it without some
feedback, in case I damage my target. My proposed change would be raising
TCK at the end of usbprog_runtest(), so the next L-H transition of TCK
inside the tms-chain function in the firmware has the desired effect.
