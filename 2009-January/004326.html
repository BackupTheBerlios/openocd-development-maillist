Yes that will still be a to do item.  However, this is not as bad as it 
sounds:

1) the jtag_add_clocks()  function is only called from xsvf.c

2) it is never called from there unless either:

    a) xsvf is invoked with &quot;virt2&quot;.   Not likely.
    b) the user has Lattice specific extensions in the SVF file.  Not 
likely. 
    c) a person uses my xsvf_tools and there is a RUNTEST in the file.  
This gets translated to XWAITSTATE and from here jtag_add_clocks() is 
called.

The virt2 option, oddly named, means that the RUNTEST timedelay is to be 
interpreted as clocks not usecs.  Most of the time this is interpreted 
as usecs and jtag_add_sleep() happens.

The most likely scenario is 2.c and if jtag_add_clocks() is called with 
clock_count==0, then this also will have no effect if you were to add a 
test for it before allocating the JTAG_STABLECLOCKS command onto the queue.




If it is called against a driver not supporting JTAG_STABLECLOCKS, then 
*something like* (in those respective drivers) line
1444 of ft2232.c will be hit:

            default:
                LOG_ERROR(&quot;BUG: unknown JTAG command type encountered&quot;);
                exit(-1);

I wonder if those who are more familiar with their respective drivers 
wouldn't mind adding this support over time.  I don't know if you have a 
TODO list anywhere in the project.  But this is not a hard function to 
add for those that have written the jtag_add_runtest() function.

I simply don't have the time, nor the expertise to add this to all the 
drivers, nor the facility to test those changes.

I would hate for this to be a reason to avoid committing the patch and 
building from here.

Dick
