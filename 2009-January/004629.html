<PRE>This patch implements a &quot;Cable Helper API&quot; and is quite extensive.

Please see the comments and API docs in jtag.h contained within the 
delimiters:

/*-----&lt;Cable Helper API&gt;-------------------------------------------*/

here is the good stuff

/*-----&lt;/Cable Helper API&gt;------------------------------------------*/


The comments within this region are Doxygen compatible and will generate 
nice HTML docs from the Doxyfile patch I submitted earlier.


The motivation for this was three fold:

1) Document the stuff cable drivers can use to make their lives easier.

2) Get to a point where no TAP state changes can happen without them 
being logged by a cable driver via the new tap_set_state() function.  
Think of this function like a reporter or a broadcast service now.  If a 
driver is going to affect a state change in a real TAP controller on the 
cable, then it should tell this function about EVERY transition.  The 
overhead is nil, but if compiled with JTAG_DEBUG_IO enabled, the state 
changes can be logged. 

Note that no driver is at this point yet, but I will be pushing the 
ft2232.c driver there as soon as this patch is committed.  I did not 
want to introduce too many changes at once.


3)  Information hiding, reduction of global variables.


4) Move away from so damn many arrays, which are prone to out of bounds 
problems and cannot be documented as well as functions.  Switches and 
functions are used instead.


This is about 80% of what I wanted to accomplish.  The state tracking is 
simple from here and that is still coming for my driver.


For example:

    tap_set_state() and tap_get_state() replace cur_state.

Generate the docs with Doxygen, and read the jtag.h file's output.

Dick
