The two are not mutually exclusive.  Since there have been no  
versioned releases, the first number is entirely arbitrary since we  
need to pick a number but it has no meaning within the project  
itself.  But it also means that users will perceive a meaning based on  
comparisons to other projects.

&gt;<i> 0.7 indicates 70% done to me. Very much workable, but not a finished

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sure, but 0.1 can just as easily indicate the first release that we  
feel is acceptable for users to test.  The number has no intrinsic  
meaning at this point since it is the first one.  Any meaning attached  
to the number isn't likely to make any sense to a general user.  In  
fact, choosing something like 0.7 could just as easily cause more  
confusion than confidence.  Someone will ask where versions 0.1-0.6  
are.  Saying we chose 0.7 because we wanted people to have more  
confidence that it was stable or because we wanted to give the  
impression that it was close to a 1.0 feels like an attempt to mislead.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Every software project suffers the same fate.  There are always new  
features to add, bugs to fix, and better architectures.  Version 1.0  
doesn't mean a project is done, just that it has reached a point where  
it is good enough for general use.  Otherwise, Microsoft Office  
wouldn't be working on version 14.0.
