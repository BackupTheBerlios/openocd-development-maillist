&gt;&gt;<i> It is this kind of thing that make the maintenance considerations
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> important. Again, C in my opinion, it not the easiest language in which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to maintain something like this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The choice of language has very little to do with maintainability 
</I>&gt;<i> (except for certain extreme cases for things like assembler, 
</I>&gt;<i> brainfuck, etc).  The coding style, documentation (both in comments 
</I>&gt;<i> and as separate files), and experience of the author are all much 
</I>&gt;<i> larger factors.  This is my opinion.
</I>

It is possible that I am over estimating the amount of maintenance that 
this new code will require.   Should it require the amount I'm 
estimating, I am saying that Python is a higher level language than 
C.    And that because of that, the maintenance is easier in Python due 
to the fact that strides in C are done in smaller steps, all of which 
require thought from the developer and all of which are prone to error 
and cost time.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It is especially curious why this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should exist at all when as of two weeks ago there was an SVF conversion
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tool in this project.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>
&gt;<i> It .... does not require a separate step to use.
</I>

You are correct if it works as advertised.  


(If it does not work, then someone will have to maintain/fix it, and 
that is when my concerns would come into play.)


Now if I may change the subject a little, back to the language issue:

I was also under the impression that C was being used in this project 
because the project wanted to minimize runtime footprint, and that 
duplication of features was not desirable because of runtime footprint 
costs.  

Now because this is a duplication of an existing feature, one could now 
assume that runtime footprint is no longer a high priority for this 
project.   (I am not saying that runtime footprint should be a priority.)

With that assumption in mind, I again feel it bolsters my belief that C 
is NOT the correct language for any part of this project except for the 
cable drivers, and even they could be done in C++.   I am fluent in C, 
C++, Java and Python and have seen wide variation in maintainability and 
ease of adding new features that want to jiggle the status quo of 
thought on this issue a little here.


A man holding a shovel once told a bull dozer salesman to go away, he 
could move dirt without the bull dozer.
