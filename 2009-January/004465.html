I don't believe that was the case at all.  Many of the developers on  
this project are more comfortable with C and the original program was  
written in C.  Rather than spend months rewriting it in a new language  
for dubious reward, we can add to and maintain the existing code base.

There are _some_ users that incorporate OpenOCD as part of an embedded  
system (see ZY1000) and have limited system resources.  Keeping the  
overall footprint down is a good things for them, but certainly _not_  
the main driving force.  They are welcome to simply remove any  
functionality they do not wish to have.  Also, the duplication  
provided here is extremely small.  The entire SVF support is under  
3000 lines (I don't have the exact number handy) and should compile  
down to under 1K of code and data.

I would completely support a patch that provided SVF support by having  
an in-program converter to XSVF.  The python-based converter serves a  
purpose, but it is not a complete answer.

&gt;<i> With that assumption in mind, I again feel it bolsters my belief  
</I>&gt;<i> that C is NOT the correct language for any part of this project  
</I>&gt;<i> except for the cable drivers, and even they could be done in C++.    
</I>&gt;<i> I am fluent in C, C++, Java and Python and have seen wide variation  
</I>&gt;<i> in maintainability and ease of adding new features that want to  
</I>&gt;<i> jiggle the status quo of thought on this issue a little here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You are entitled to your belief, but unless the majority of the  
developers agree that the project should be rewritten in another  
language, it will _not_ happen.  I have 10+ years of experience in 23  
programming languages.  The design of the program is much more vital  
to ease of maintainability and extension than the language.  I've seen  
examples of both good and poor design in all of those languages (C, C+ 
+, Java, and Python included).

</I>&gt;<i> A man holding a shovel once told a bull dozer salesman to go away,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
And he might be right to do so if the job was a thousand miles from a  
gas station that has diesel.
