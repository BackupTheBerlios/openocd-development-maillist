1)
Attached is a configuration file for the SVN version of uncrustify.

I worked on this about an hour or so from a C++ project, and it is 
pretty decent now.

Also is a script to run it from the command line.   I have it setup so I 
can run it from within JEdit however.

If and when you commit this, please set the svn-eol style to native and 
also set the *.sh file as executable.

If this proves useful, I will be happy to help submit patches over time 
that fix up each source file, at least the ones that look odd.


2)
I also have the tap_set_state() patch about ready, but want to do some 
more work with it within ft2232.c before I submit it.


3)
Lastly, I noticed that JTAG_END_STATE is basically orphaned, there is no 
way to put it into a driver's queue.   I wonder if that was an abandoned 
train of thought.  I stumbled onto this while implementing 
tap_set_state().  At that time I am also trying to bring clarity to the 
end_state variable and creating accessors for that too.


Thanks,

Dick
