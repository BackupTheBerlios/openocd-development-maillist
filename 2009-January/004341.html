I think you're reading that a bit too pedantically.  But if the
documentation is really unclear, perhaps somebody with the ability and
inclination to do so will clear it up.  Everybody is always busy, so it
might be helpful for you to propose replacement verbiage which still means
what it's supposed to, yet resolves the ambiguity that you perceive.  Or
generate and submit a patch which makes that change.  The patch would then
be accepted or not.

OpenOCD knows nothing about your interface or board until you tell it.
