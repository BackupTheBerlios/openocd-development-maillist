Chapter 5.6 Target Software Changes :
ARM Wait-For-Interrupt... Many ARM chips synchronize the JTAG clock using the
core clock. Low power states which stop that core clock thus prevent
JTAG access. Idle
loops in tasking environments often enter those low power states via
the WFI instruction
(or its coprocessor equivalent, before ARMv7).
You may want to disable that instruction in source code, or otherwise
prevent using that
state, to ensure you can get JTAG access at any time. For example, the OpenOCD
halt command may not work for an idle processor otherwise.

As a more polite alternative, some processors have special
debug-oriented registers which can be used to
change various features including how the low power states are clocked
while debugging. The STM32
DBGMCU CR register is an example; at the cost of extra power
consumption, JTAG can be used during
low power states.

Chapter 6.2.4
Warning: On most ARMs, JTAG clock detection is coupled to the core clock, so
software using a &#8216;wait for interrupt&#8217; operation blocks JTAG access. Adaptive
clocking provides a partial workaround, but a more complete solution just
avoids using that instruction with JTAG debuggers.

Chapter 15.2 Target State handling
Warning: On ARM cores, software using the wait for interrupt operation
often blocks the JTAG access needed by a halt command. This is because
that operation also puts the core into a low power mode by gating the
core clock; but the core clock is needed to detect JTAG clock transitions.
One partial workaround uses adaptive clocking: when the core is interrupted
the operation completes, then JTAG clocks are accepted at least
until the interrupt handler completes. However, this workaround is often
unusable since the processor, board, and JTAG adapter must all support
adaptive JTAG clocking. Also, it can&#8217;t work until an interrupt is issued.
A more complete workaround is to not use that operation while you work
with a JTAG debugger. Tasking environments generaly have idle loops
where the body is the wait for interrupt operation. (On older cores, it is
a coprocessor action; newer cores have a &#8216;wfi&#8217; instruction.) Such loops
can just remove that operation, at the cost of higher power consumption
(because the CPU is needlessly clocked).

Chapter 22 FAQ
You can still debug the &#8217;low power&#8217; situations - you just need to
either use a fixed and
very slow JTAG clock rate ... or else manually adjust the clock speed
at every step.
(Adjusting is painful and tedious, and is not always practical.)
It is however easy to &#8220;code your way around it&#8221; - i.e.: Cheat a
little, have a special
debug mode in your application that does a &#8220;high power sleep&#8221;. If you
are careful -
98% of your problems can be debugged this way.
Note that on ARM you may need to avoid using the wait for interrupt operation in
your idle loops even if you don&#8217;t otherwise change the CPU clock rate.
That operation
gates the CPU clock, and thus the JTAG clock; which prevents JTAG access. One
consequence is not being able to halt cores which are executing that
wait for interrupt
operation.
