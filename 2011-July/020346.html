<PRE>Hi Igor,

&gt;<i> JB&gt; However, I'd really like something which would allow custom RSP
</I>&gt;<i> JB&gt; commands (which can write back to the socket) to be handled.
</I>&gt;<i> JB&gt; The problems I see are that, even though the gdb_put_packet() function
</I>&gt;<i> JB&gt; is declared and could be used by target code, I can't, for the life of
</I>&gt;<i> JB&gt; me, figure out where I could get the right connection* to be putting
</I>&gt;<i> JB&gt; the data out at the right place. Also, the unconditional &quot;OK&quot; being
</I>&gt;<i> JB&gt; sent isn't great either - perhaps that could be conditional on a
</I>&gt;<i> JB&gt; return value from command_run_line() or something.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm quite sure you can send a different response for qRcmd - that's how
</I>&gt;<i> you can use the usual &quot;telnet&quot; interface from inside GDB. Otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> have a look at the File-I/O Remote Protocol Extension or qXfer commands.
</I>
I'd really like to just be able to do something like the following in
my registered command handler:

1) Extract the register address from the command string
2) Do the access to the CPU
3) Format the read value into ASCII and call gdb_put_packet() to write it back.

The problem is I can't call gdb_put_packet() from my target-specific
command because the required struct connection* isn't passed to the
command handler. These go through command_line_run() which is actually
turning it into a TCL command call.

I figure I shouldn't be putting in architecture-specific stuff to the
generic RSP server code, so I can't figure out the best way to do
this, other than perhaps making the current connection a global, which
I also have a feeling would be bad.

Have I missed something, or am I more likely to find a better solution
by changing our GDB port?

Thanks,

    Julius
