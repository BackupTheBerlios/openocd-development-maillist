I do not get this function at all... What I see is that it is presumed
that host executing this code must be in the same endianess as the
target who filled this buffer. Otherwise bytes get flipped.

Here is an experiment :
Let's imagine that target is BE. Then it will put word 0x12345678 read
from the it's (target's) mem like this :
buffer[0] = 0x12
buffer [1] = 0x34
buffer[2] = 0x56
buffer[3] = 0x78

Because BE keeps MSB on lower addr.

On the LE host, function buf_get_u32() will shift 0x78 to addr 0x3,
0x56 to addr 0x2, etc and you will get :
 | 78 | 56 | 34  | 12 | &lt;--- value (hex)
 |  3  |  2  |  1  | 0   | &lt;--- addr

i.e, you will have 0x78453412 as a return on a LE host, which is, ay
you see, flipped value.
It is because you kept MSB part put by the target in beuffer[0] on
your host's addr 0x0, i.e. you did not shift it you addr 0x3.
On LE arch MSB is kept on higher addresses.

Similar will happen if you have LE target and BE host.

That's why I do not think that this function was ever meant to do any
conversion to host's endianess, as you say. What I thing is that it is
a function that *must* be used locally on the host, and *only* on the
data filled by the host, because then we are guaranteed that the
person who fills the buffer[] is the same who reads it, i.e. endianess
is same for the reader and for the writer.

Do you agree with me on this, or am I missing something ?


What is funny however, is that I have BE target and LE host, and MIPS
code seems to be working fine... Which would say that EJTAG somehow
speaks LE with my host. Crazy thing.



&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The endianness of MIPS EJTAG tap seems to have always the same endianness,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> no matter of MIPS CPU memory endianness.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> What makes you think so ?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Because openocd works in all combinations of BE and LE host and target. (If you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> revert commit 2482244b0788c007dd789c21a4416379c229ea5c.) So yes, it's just a guess.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Which might mean that all commands are sent to EJTAG in appropriate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> target format in which CPU expects them (be it BE or LE, depends in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which mode it runs).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can't find code that swaps target endianness in mips32_pracc.c or mips_ejtag.c
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Could this be the explanation:

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Page 97:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Byte 0 refers to bits 7:0, byte 1 refers to bits 15:8, byte 2 refers to bits 23:16, and byte 3 refers to bits
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 31:24, independent of endianess.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is _always_ the case in _all_ architectures. But, as you see,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this Byte0 is put to lower addresses for LE and to higher for BE. This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is always the case.

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Byte 0 refers to bits 7:0, byte 1 refers to bits 15:8, byte 2 refers to bits 23:16, and byte 3 refers to bits
</I>&gt;<i> 31:24, independent of endianess.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My guess is, if you read out a 32bit value, target endianness doesn't matter.
</I>
This is the only sane solution I can think of. It would say that EJTAG
is a bi-endian machine that can read both BE and LE if we feed it
fixed instr. size.

Do you know some examples of architectures (bi-endian) like this ? How
can it exactly guess the endianess of the program and adopt itself
appropriately ?

&gt;<i> If a 8bit value is read out, you get byte0 for address 0 in LE mode and byte3 at address 0 in BE mode.
</I>
OK, but this does not change anything for any architecture in the
world, as I said - this chapter is just the MIPS terminology, theirs
notation, nothing significant there, IMHO.

As I said, for value 0x12345678, on BE byte0 is bits 7..0 = 0x78.
Reading addr 0x0 you will get MSB on BE, as it stores MSB on lower
addr, so you will get 0x12, which is in MIPS (or any other notation)
byte3 of the 4-byte value, as it holds MSB, i.e. bits 31..28.

As I said, I do not see nothing special there, but it might be that I
am missing something you want to point out.

Drasko
