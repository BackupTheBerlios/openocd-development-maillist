<PRE>This is a bit &quot;off-topic&quot; - but I'll offer this:

???&gt;&gt;   to make drills metalization at home to produce advanced two 
layerpcb... maybe you guys know some tricks?

??? &gt;&gt;  I have not found a solution that works in a small-volume hobby 
setting.

I really don't like messing with the Ferric Chloride chemicals to etch 
the board, I did that 30+ years ago, it's messy and nasty, my results 
where very poor, inconsistent, and I never really did enough boards to 
make it worth while.

Today the solutions below are FAR better and cheap enough!

For those of you in the USA, I have found these two places useful:

======
Option 1

             www.expresspcb.com

They have a simple &quot;mini-board&quot; service,  board is fixed size: 64mm x 
96mm (2.5in by 3.8in)
Double sided, no more then 350 holes, 3 boards, and only in sets of 3 
boards.

In the USA, we get 3 day delivery after order.

No solder mask:  $51 + $10 shipping.
W/ solder mask:  $75 + $10 shipping

QTY 3 boards, and only in sets of 3 boards.

4layer w/mask:  $98 + $10 shipping

They say they ship to europe for about $45 (base price for many boards)

I believe these are Tin/Lead - and not RoHS.
Not sure if that matters to you, as this is hobby level stuff.

Why so cheap:
     (a) their software does the pcb design.
     (b) Their software does DRC for their price, and their system
     (c) Their software submits into their automatic system
     (d) The can efficiently panel up these boards with other boards
     (e) Hole count is reasonable
     (f) Simple shipping scheme - USPS priority mail.

ie: It is ZERO TOUCH - I think the only time a human touches it, is when 
they put it in the envelope.

======
Option 2 - not sure about europe sales

and    www.pcb123.com - aka: SUNSTONE
     They support EAGLE layouts


====

BOTH have clunky simple FREE schematic/pcb design software, they come 
with a large parts catalog from Digikey (well known here in the USA)

Above are of course &quot;hobby grade&quot; tools, nothing like the guys at work 
use, (mentor graphics, they routinely do 10 layer complex, extremely 
high density layouts).

You get what you pay for.

====

Your next step is to buy solder paste, create a reflow oven, etc.
or do all of this by hand....

Just think of the looks your Significant Other  will give you when you 
make one! Priceless!

     <A HREF="http://www.instructables.com/id/Toaster-Oven-Reflow-Soldering-BGA/">http://www.instructables.com/id/Toaster-Oven-Reflow-Soldering-BGA/</A>

here's a couple solution with a frying pan...  I have my doubts...
I know people who have done the toaster oven method.
I've always done the hand-solder method.
