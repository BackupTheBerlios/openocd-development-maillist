<PRE>Hi list,

I've been trying for some days to get the Segger JLink EDU
version going with OpenOCD on Windows 7 32 bit. As the JLink, 
OpenOCD and LibUSB might have be the reason for the failure, 
I tried various combinations.

It does work now, but chances are that other people face the
same issue, hence the post.

The results as of now are that current Segger firmware prevents
the adapter from working with OpenOCD. As soon as OpenOCD starts
up, the LED is flashing green, then shortly red before the
device vanishes completely. The relevant error is &quot;usb_bulk_read
failed&quot;. It comes up again after a minute or so.

- I tried OpenOCD versions v0.2.0, v0.3.0, v0.4.0 and a beta
  build of 0.5.0.

- I had LibUSB running in versions 1.2.2.0, 1.2.4.0 and the
  latest development snapshot, both with .inf and filter
  driver.

- JLink software (including firmware) was 4.31 and 4.20
  first, finally 4.10i.
          
After flashing 4.10i ('exec invalidateFw' in Segger Commander),
flashing my hardware (Cortwith 0.5.0. I don't consider this a a 
serious issue, since its still beta (see the log at 
<A HREF="http://www.target23.de/tmp/log_0.5.0.txt">http://www.target23.de/tmp/log_0.5.0.txt</A>)

The version of LibUSB is also irrelevant, it worked with all
three; the filter driver was sufficient.

Sorry for not providing more logs etc. to get behind the 
reason for the failure, but I don't feel a strong desire 
to go through all that again.

Hope that helps,
/Markus
