Thanks, I was on 2010q3. Tried the newer one, and it initially didn't 
work, just locked up like yagarto. I eventually found reducing the 
jtag_nsrst_delay and jtag_ntrst_delay in my config and that got the 
newer Sourcery going (although this doesn't get yagarto going, it still 
doesn't work for me).

Stepping is still slow though. I'm wondering if this is related to my 
cygwin on this machine, I've noticed that configure scripts on anything 
run incredibly slowly, never found out why. I decided to cross compile 
openocd from linux to rule out any issues from compiling with my cygwin 
(even though I used the mno-cygwin flag) but this also didn't make any 
difference. I'm not sure, maybe cygwin is stuffing up port's still or 
something.

Delving into openocd logs, taking a -d3 on both pipe and tcp usage, I 
get exactly the same commands being run for both when stepping over the 
first line of my program, but in pipe usage lots of them take 100ms longer:

pipe:
Debug:    1292    17869   arm7_9_common.c:2121    arm7_9_step():    
target    stepped
Debug:    1293    17969    gdb_server.c:2200    gdb_input_inner():    
received    packet:    'g'
Debug:    1294    18078    gdb_server.c:2200    gdb_input_inner():    
received    packet:    's'
Debug:    1295    18078    target.c:1063    
target_call_event_callbacks():    target    event    7    (gdb-start)

tcp:
Debug:    1161    36347    0    arm7_9_common.c:2121    
arm7_9_step():    target    stepped
Debug:    1162    36347    0    gdb_server.c:2200    
gdb_input_inner():    received    packet:    'g'
Debug:    1163    36348    1    gdb_server.c:2200    
gdb_input_inner():    received    packet:    's'
Debug:    1164    36349    1    target.c:1063    
target_call_event_callbacks():    target    event    7    (gdb-start)

notice the time counter increments 100 ms after both the arm7... line 
and the first received packet, whereas for tcp usage there's increments 
of 0 and 1 ms.

There's heaps of commands in the pipe usage that have this extra 100ms 
delay in them:
               Debug:    1364    18111    target.c:1063    
target_call_event_callbacks():    target    event    8    (gdb-end)
               Debug:    1365    18111    arm7_9_common.c:2121   
  arm7_9_step():    target    stepped
here-&gt;   Debug:    1366    18211    gdb_server.c:2200   
  gdb_input_inner():    received    packet:    'g'
here-&gt;   Debug:    1367    18318    gdb_server.c:2200   
  gdb_input_inner():    received    packet:    &quot;'m1102941c,4'&quot;
               Debug:    1368    18318    gdb_server.c:1278   
  gdb_read_memory_packet():    addr:    &quot;0x1102941c,&quot;    len:    0x00000004
               Debug:    1369    18318    target.c:1444   
  target_read_buffer():    reading    buffer    of    4    byte    at   
  0x1102941c
               Debug:    1370    18318    arm7_9_common.c:2270   
  arm7_9_read_memory():    address:    &quot;0x1102941c,&quot;    size:   
  &quot;0x00000004,&quot;    count:    0x00000001
here-&gt;   Debug:    1371    18419    gdb_server.c:2200   
  gdb_input_inner():    received    packet:    &quot;'m110294ac,4'&quot;

after most, but not all arm7_9_read_memory commands, here one that didn't:

Debug:    1297    18078    gdb_server.c:1475    
gdb_step_continue_packet():    step
Debug:    1225    17838    arm7_9_common.c:2270    
arm7_9_read_memory():    address:    &quot;0x110294a4,&quot;    size:    
&quot;0x00000004,&quot;    count:    0x00000001
Debug:    1226    17839    target.c:1606    target_read_u32():    
address:    &quot;0x110294a4,&quot;    value:    0xe3a01004
Debug:    1227    17839    arm7_9_common.c:1615    
arm7_9_restore_context():    -
Debug:    1228    17849    arm7_9_common.c:1638   
  arm7_9_restore_context():    examining    Supervisor    mode

As far as I can tell, every arm7_9_read_memory() call after a 
target_read_buffer() has the 100ms delay (it's always between 100 and 
103ms) added to it, and there's plenty of them. I'm guessing that's when 
openocd is transferring the read data back up the pipe?

This might be a far too obscure issue to find, and I don't have another 
computer to try it on at the moment to find out if it's something 
specific to my particular pc, or a broader issue. For what it's worth 
I'm on Win 7 x64, using openocd with proprietary ftdi driver.

Just had an idea, and now I definitely think it's a system wide pipe 
issue; from cygwin prompt:
$ time echo &quot;blah&quot;
blah

real    0m0.001s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.000s

$ time echo &quot;blah&quot; | cat
blah

real    0m0.151s
user    0m0.031s
sys     0m0.030s

Darn, might have to hit up the cygwin guys for help.

&gt;&gt;<i> One other point, do you know whether you can get openocd to add it's own
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> program directory to the search path for the source [find ...] lines? It'd
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be great to only need the openocd.cfg file in the eclipse project dir, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have it reference the interface and target files from the common openocd
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> folder. Otherwise I'll likely copy the contents of the files into my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> openocd.cfg rather than have a copy of target and interface folders in all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my project folders.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> try something like:
</I>&gt;<i> add_script_search_dir {c:\cygwin\home\soliver\openocd\openocd\tcl}
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Thanks for that, that's exactly what I was looking for.

Cheers,
Andrew
