</I>&gt;<i> bash-4.1# time echo &quot;blah&quot; | cat
</I>&gt;<i> blah
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yeah I do know that cygwin is usually significantly slower, that's why I 
recompiled openocd with mingw from linux, to ensure that there was no 
cygwin getting in the way, but it made no difference.

The idea behind the bash commands was seeing that simply adding a pipe 
into the command was adding a ~ 100ms delay difference between the user 
and real figures. I thought that'd be relevant by comparison to openocd 
piped commands. This made me think it's a system wide issue, but I 
thought the cygwin guys might have more of an idea about it as they'd be 
using pipes far more often to know if it's fixable. I haven't had a 
chance to start searching their archives yet, just got back into work now.

Thanks for showing that you get similarly slow pipe'd commands. I don't 
suppose you've tried openocd with pipe usage at all to see if it's also 
slow?

Cheers,
Andrew
