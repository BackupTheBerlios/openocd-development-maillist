<PRE>Hi all,

I'm looking at adding OpenRISC 1000 support to OpenOCD.

At present, the OpenRISC GDB port implements reading and writing to
individual CPU registers by an &quot;spr&quot; command within GDB. This sends
out CPU register access requests as remote commands, and they are
handled in by the RSP server as commands beginning with the &quot;qRcmd&quot;
string. The two commands to write and read the registers are
&quot;writespr&quot; and &quot;readspr&quot;.

A &quot;writespr&quot; command is followed by a register number and a value, and
if all goes well GDB expects an &quot;OK&quot; back from the server.
A &quot;readspr&quot; command is followed by an address, and expects the 8 ASCII
character representation of the 32-bit data returned over the socket.

&gt;<i>From what I can tell, it's not so hard to implement the SPR write
</I>command, as we can register a command which will go and do it and just
return. However, I'm more concerned about how I go about implementing
the SPR read. What I need here is the ability to write back to the GDB
client via the socket, but as far as I can tell there's no mechanism
allowing this from target code. Also, from looking at the
gdb_query_packet() function in src/server/gdb_server.c, &#160;the &quot;OK&quot; that
appears to be sent back to GDB unconditionally whenever handling a
&quot;qRcmd,&quot; string wouldn't make this workable, either.

One solution is we make our GDB port not use these remote query
commands and instead rely on the register cache fetched with the &quot;g&quot;
RSP command.

However, I'd really like something which would allow custom RSP
commands (which can write back to the socket) to be handled.

The problems I see are that, even though the gdb_put_packet() function
is declared and could be used by target code, I can't, for the life of
me, figure out where I could get the right connection* to be putting
the data out at the right place. Also, the unconditional &quot;OK&quot; being
sent isn't great either - perhaps that could be conditional on a
return value from command_run_line() or something.

What are people's thoughts on this? Maybe I've misunderstood something
and this is actually doable. If so, any pointers would be appreciated.

Thanks,

&#160; &#160; Julius
