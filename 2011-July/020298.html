<PRE>2011/7/17 Michel Catudal &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">michelcatudal at gmail.com</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> Isn't the Atmel ICE a cheaper and limited version of Jlink?
</I>&gt;<i> Isn't possible that the software change was made to make
</I>&gt;<i> sure that it would not work with OpenOCD?
</I>
This is probably not true. Atmel Sam-ICE is an OEM version
of Segger J-Link which limits it to the Atmel MCU/MPUs.

There are OEM versions which have some limitations.
IAR's OEM version has the least limitations (not working
inside Keil MDK but works for all vendors' device).
<A HREF="http://www.segger.com/cms/terms-of-use.html">http://www.segger.com/cms/terms-of-use.html</A>

&gt;<i> If you can get OpenOCD to work with the cheaper version then
</I>&gt;<i> you are hurting Segger's profits. I would be suprised if they would
</I>&gt;<i> agree to not be in full control of their hardware.
</I>
OpenOCD does break some limitations of the OEM versions
of J-Link since it does not limit them to a specific vendor's
device. I am not so sure if this is a big problem for Segger
or not. If it is, probably they will request OpenOCD to put
in the limitation codes (detect the J-Link and detect the
target), so far I have not seen anything like that.

&gt;<i> If Segger keeps up nonsense like that wouldn't the solution be
</I>&gt;<i> to ignore them and go with something like Versaloon or any
</I>&gt;<i> other manufacturer who &#160;doesn't make it a routine to break our code?
</I>
Many of us have various version of J-Link. So that is probably
the best incentive to support it. It is a good one in terms of
capability.

Similarly there are desires to support vendor's proprietary
Jtag hardware like ST-Link, LPC-Link simply because many
of us got them even though they are not as open as Versaloon.

&gt;<i> Can you reflash the Jlink that have issues with an older software
</I>&gt;<i> version or is it new hardware?
</I>
Yes you can and that is the current work-around for J-Link V8.
Probably it will be the same story for J-Link Pro and J-Link Ultra.
It does not seem to affect V7/V6 or below.
