<PRE>I can partially confirm...

Tested with 0.5.0-rc1

Comparing with &quot;right image&quot; works fine:

&gt;&gt;<i> verify_image <A HREF="c://stm32_blink_led.bin">c://stm32_blink_led.bin</A> 0x8000000
</I>&gt;<i> verified 29888 bytes in 0.468750s (62.267 KiB/s)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> verify_image <A HREF="c://stm32_blink_led.bin">c://stm32_blink_led.bin</A>
</I>&gt;<i> verified 29888 bytes in 0.484375s (60.258 KiB/s)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> verify_image <A HREF="c://stm32_blink_led.hex">c://stm32_blink_led.hex</A>
</I>&gt;<i> verified 29888 bytes in 0.500000s (58.375 KiB/s)

</I>&gt;<i> verified 29888 bytes in 0.921875s (31.661 KiB/s)
</I>
Comparing with &quot;almost right image&quot; (compilation date inside has 
changed) works fine too:

&gt;&gt;<i> verify_image <A HREF="c://stm32_blink_led.elf">c://stm32_blink_led.elf</A>

However... when checking against something completely wrong (almost 
completely different code) strange things happen. When checking against 
bin, everything is as expected, but when checking against hex or elf:

&gt;&gt;<i> verify_image <A HREF="c://stm32_blink_led.hex">c://stm32_blink_led.hex</A>
</I>&gt;<i> checksum mismatch - attempting binary compare
</I>&gt;<i> diff 0 address 0x20000000. Was 0x02 instead of 0x28
</I>&gt;<i> diff 1 address 0x20000001. Was 0x46 instead of 0x03
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> diff 126 address 0x20000097. Was 0x00 instead of 0x20
</I>&gt;<i> diff 127 address 0x20000098. Was 0x00 instead of 0x15
</I>&gt;<i> More than 128 errors, the rest are not printed.
</I>&gt;<i> in procedure 'verify_image'
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> verify_image <A HREF="c://stm32_blink_led.elf">c://stm32_blink_led.elf</A>
</I>&gt;<i> checksum mismatch - attempting binary compare
</I>&gt;<i> diff 0 address 0x20000000. Was 0x02 instead of 0x28
</I>&gt;<i> diff 1 address 0x20000001. Was 0x46 instead of 0x03
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> diff 126 address 0x20000097. Was 0x00 instead of 0x20
</I>&gt;<i> diff 127 address 0x20000098. Was 0x00 instead of 0x15
</I>&gt;<i> More than 128 errors, the rest are not printed.
</I>&gt;<i> in procedure 'verify_image'
</I>
If you specify address it is treated as an offset from beginning of RAM...

&gt;&gt;<i> verify_image <A HREF="c://stm32_blink_led.hex">c://stm32_blink_led.hex</A> 0x2000
</I>&gt;<i> checksum mismatch - attempting binary compare
</I>&gt;<i> diff 0 address 0x20002000. Was 0x02 instead of 0x28
</I>&gt;<i> diff 1 address 0x20002001. Was 0x02 instead of 0x03
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> diff 126 address 0x2000207f. Was 0x37 instead of 0x20
</I>&gt;<i> diff 127 address 0x20002080. Was 0x10 instead of 0x15
</I>&gt;<i> More than 128 errors, the rest are not printed.
</I>&gt;<i> in procedure 'verify_image'
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> verify_image <A HREF="c://stm32_blink_led.hex">c://stm32_blink_led.hex</A> 0x4000
</I>&gt;<i> checksum mismatch - attempting binary compare
</I>&gt;<i> diff 0 address 0x20004000. Was 0x8a instead of 0x28
</I>&gt;<i> diff 1 address 0x20004001. Was 0xb9 instead of 0x03
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> diff 126 address 0x2000407e. Was 0x52 instead of 0x00
</I>&gt;<i> diff 127 address 0x2000407f. Was 0x96 instead of 0x20
</I>&gt;<i> More than 128 errors, the rest are not printed.
</I>&gt;<i> in procedure 'verify_image'
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> verify_image <A HREF="c://stm32_blink_led.hex">c://stm32_blink_led.hex</A> 0x8000
</I>&gt;<i> stm32.cpu -- clearing lockup after double fault
</I>&gt;<i> error executing cortex_m3 crc algorithm
</I>&gt;<i> JTAG-DP STICKY ERROR
</I>&gt;<i> MEM_AP_CSW 0x23000052, MEM_AP_TAR 0x20008004
</I>&gt;<i> JTAG-DP STICKY ERROR
</I>&gt;<i> MEM_AP_CSW 0x23000052, MEM_AP_TAR 0x20008004
</I>&gt;<i> Block read error address 0x20008000
</I>&gt;<i> in procedure 'verify_image'
</I>
(it's the same for elf).

So sometimes OpenOCD starts the check in completely wrong location...

4\/3!!
