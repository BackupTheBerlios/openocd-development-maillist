<PRE>Hello Vincent,

thank you a lot for this contribution, highly appreciated. I applied both 
patches to my local tree.

I've finally had a chance to look at your trace code, but decided to use it 
only for reference, because your way of treating a 16-bit port as two 8-bit 
packets with the second pipestat set to WT didn't work well for me.
As I understand it the major problem with 16-bit ports is the possibility of 
the second half containing no data, and we only know that by the time we 
decoded all the pipestats and tracepacket up to this point. 4-bit ports like 
the LPC2000's cause similar problems, because we won't know in advance when a 
packet starts.

In the meantime I've written a generic framework consisting of an etm with an 
attached capture driver (currently ETB only). The data capture is in place, 
and I'm about to add the decoding back in. My new code takes all port widths 
and port modes available in ETMv1.3 (ETM7 and ETM9) into account.

I hope to be able to check everything in within the next few days.

Best regards,

Dominic
