<PRE>Hello list,

I've just committed a huge pile of assorted changes to the OpenOCD SVN 
repository. This checkin is specifically marked as experimental because of 
the relatively large number of untested changes.

From the commit message:
- split fileio handling into fileio part and image handling
This is towards a transparent image handling support in the OpenOCD. 
Currently, only binary images (&quot;plain&quot; or &quot;flat&quot; binaries, as produced by 
objcopy -O binary) and intel hex files are supported, but I'd like to be able 
to add other formats, especially ELF files.
The fileio support should transparently handle local and remote file locations 
(currently local only).

- reworked etm/etb into a generic etm part with trace capture drivers 
(currently only etb supported)
- added XScale debug handler binary to repository
- added Thumb disassembling (thanks to Vincent Palatin for this patch)

- added support for non-CFI compatible flashes to cfi driver (currently only 
SST39VFxxx devices supported)
The cfi driver is currently being worked on by Carsten, but I wanted to get 
the changes I made for the people from linkstationwiki into the repository, 
to make sure my tree and Carsten's tree don't drift too far apart.

Best regards,

Dominic

</PRE>
