<PRE>Hello Carsten,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Sounds good :)

&gt;<i> Maybe the debug_handler.bin files should included into the repository
</I>&gt;<i> also for /trunk. It isn't obvious, that it's missing. Otherwise the
</I>&gt;<i> build process could compile it (needs some configure switches to use
</I>&gt;<i> right compiler/asm) or at least show up some big message about the these
</I>&gt;<i> binaries (so you can build them by hand).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yeah, I forgot to add them to the repository, this is corrected now (in my 
local repostiory, till I have my other changes ready).
Having the build process handle building the handler would further complicate 
things, I think it's safe to use the generated binary.

&gt;<i> Some other issue is that the binary is loaded from &quot;target/xscale/...&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> which only works when you are in the right directory. A location like
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/local/lib/openocd/... Would be more useful. Some other option is to
</I>&gt;<i> embedd the default debug_handler into the openocd binary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I always meant to add a configuration statement (probably just another 
argument to the existing 'debug_handler' command), but haven't found the time 
yet. The debug handler binary should also be loaded using the new fileio 
helper, I hope to find some time for this within the next few weeks.

&gt;<i> BTW: Is there a difference between the big-endian/little-endian version
</I>&gt;<i> of the debug_handler? The build scripts at least shows two variants. If
</I>&gt;<i> it matters, this should be noted in the build-script and both handlers
</I>&gt;<i> should be available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>This was from back when people tried the OpenOCD for the first time on an IXP 
platform and it wouldn't work using the LE handler. Compiling the handler BE 
didn't solve the problems (it turned out to be a problem with the JTAG 
hardware IIRC), so I commented it out again, to have something for reference 
in case I would need it. At this point I think it's safe to remove the 
reference to BE.

&gt;<i> I'm going to test the remain stuff today, esp. the flash uploader. It is
</I>&gt;<i> required to start porting U-Boot - the ability to restore the old flash
</I>&gt;<i> setup or upload new code will surely be helpful :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>You could run into problems when using a working_area, as I barely tested this 
with XScale, but it could very well work just as it is.

&gt;<i> With best regards
</I>&gt;<i> Carsten Schlote

Best regards,

Dominic
