Sending email is easy. Receiving and parsing email is not as easy.
Thus anything actually worth calling integration takes a fair bit of
work.


&gt;<i> See [1] for an existing gripe.
</I>
I'm the Peter refered to there. I also like to do patch review in the
mailer rather than in the browser, but it is difficult to integrate
that with Gerrit. Instead of asking about intent, please participate
in actually doing this integration.


&gt;<i> The main difference I see between gerrit and a mailinglist is, for
</I>&gt;<i> most users, a mailinglist is passive and consolidated.  A web
</I>&gt;<i> interface requires a lot more interaction just to keep up.

Seriously guys. Gerrit has a web interface, but it sure as hell is
not a forum, nor like one. Please spend five minutes to learn what
the software actually does and how it works - if you find no good
resources or descriptions then please ask instead of making
assumptions.

You have probably already found out that Gerrit has an SSH interface
besides the web interface. The SSH interface is of course much better
suited for integration, but so far I don't think it's possible to
create inline comments through it, which is the main glitch for me
between what I can do in my mailer and what I could do with Gerrit
via SSH. On the other hand the data is better structured in Gerrit
which is worth much more for everyone who consumes my review.

Again: Look at what the tool does and how it works! It is not a web
site. It is a code review tool which receives git commits.

I'm not at all against Gerrit sending lots of email to the list, the
only bug is that review happening on the list will miss out on the
point with Gerrit. But of course ideas about how to connect the
glitch are very welcome.


&gt;<i> A new user has to work significantly harder to maintain a prolonged
</I>&gt;<i> interest in the project with gerrit (imnsho).
</I>
See other email about Gerrit sending email.


&gt;<i> On a personal note, I've found it much easier to contribute to u-boot
</I>&gt;<i> and the kernel vice cyanogenmod.  The main reason for this is the lack
</I>&gt;<i> of a mailinglist for CM (they use gerrit).
</I>
It is IMO not possible to replace a mailing list with a code review
tool. They serve different purposes and complement each other.


&gt;<i> Maybe I'm odd and a one-off, but I thought it was worth mentioning
</I>
Please give yourself more freedom in shaping how the project works.
If you like patches to still come to the mailing list then you just
have to say so, don't apologize. :) And FWIW I don't think anyone is
against it.


&gt;<i> I'd hate to see that stream of patches and comments dissappear. :-(
</I>
I'd really like a way to do inline comments via SSH. Can you think of
any ideas for how we could do this? Gerrit needs to know which line
in which file.

The quickest thing I can come up with would be to add a prefix on
each patch line sent in email, like 1:14 meaning file 1 this patch
touches, line 14 of either the patch or the file. It would cost a few
characters per line, but it would have the data needed for an inline
comment. Combine with a PGP signature (or send via SSH) and I think
it could work. Of course someone has to develop this software too.
