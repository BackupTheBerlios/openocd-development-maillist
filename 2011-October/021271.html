This is an interesting point of view. I have no doubt that gerrit makes
life easier for the maintainers, but there is the barrier of new thing
to learn and setup hassle for a new contributor, vs the old system used
by many projects of sending patches to a mailing list. You will lose
some valuable contributions and contributors because of this.

Also the apparent attitude of &quot;screw you, we don't care if it's hard, it
makes our life easy&quot; is offputting.

I have a few patches in OpenOCD and one bug I found the other day that I
was thinking about working on and sending a patch for. But honestly,
having to set up for gerrit workflow makes me less likely to do either.

If OpenOCD suffers from a lack of maintainer time and effort but is
overrun with enthusastic contributors, then the gerrit thing seems like
a good idea.

If on the other hand the maintainers are active and keen to encourage
new contributors, and the project is suffering from lack of contributor
effort, then it seems like it will not be good for project health.

I suspect the truth lies somewhere between the two.

This is intended to be an objective bit of third-party insight, I am not
anti-gerrit - it seems like a nice tool. certainly I am a fan of CI.

I apprecite OpenOCD, I'd like to see the project grow in scope and
maturity, but this additional barrier to contributing does put me and
others off contributing in future.
