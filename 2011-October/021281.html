For sure. But I've had to learn git already for other reasons :)

&gt;<i> Please look at the updated HACKING file, or my previous email, for an

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You need an OpenID from somewhere (let me know if you want

</I>&gt;<i> You need to register on a web page and pick a username

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The above takes not two minutes.
</I>
A bit of a simplification, you also need to do the git-side setup, and
have the general slowdown of fumbling around a bit until you get the
idea of the new workflow.
But not a huge amount of work, I agree.

&gt;<i> An interesting fact is that in the project where I've seen Gerrit
</I>&gt;<i> introduced there were several new contributors sending commits,
</I>&gt;<i> who had previously never been seen on the mailing list. I was
</I>&gt;<i> surprised, but in a good way!
</I>
There will be new contributors coming along to projects all the time, of
course.. Though I suppose maybe the gerrit way of doing things could
be preferable to some as it involves less human interaction and
discussion on mailing lists, maybe for people who are wary of getting
flamed for incorrect email setup (or signatures - sorry!) or who are
not confident in their English.

Great if gerrit works well for OpenOCD, I hope it does.
I just wanted to make the point that it does involve some extra hassle
to get started contributing, and that extra barrier and possible
negative effects did not seem to have been mentioned. Most of the
discussion seemed to be maintainers or energetic contributors enthusing
about how jazzy gerrit was going to be.
