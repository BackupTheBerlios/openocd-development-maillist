Agreed, I've been thinking through the obstacles, from a submitter pov,
and I've come up with a few things that I think would help.  I'm willing
to write the patches if it's generally agreed they would be useful.

1.) Threading versions of a patch series together.  So, when the
maintainer has a chance to look at the thread, he/she can just go to the
end of the thread to get the latest version.  This would require a
hook script in 'git format-patch' to add In-Reply-To: and to do patch
versioning (read and detect from output directory?).  Possibly,
--versioning?  Basically, I'm replacing gerrit's &quot;Change-Id&quot; with smtp's
already useful &quot;Message-Id&quot; and &quot;In-Reply-To&quot;.

2.) Mod 'git format-patch' hook script to run checkpatch.pl with a repo
appropriate config, inject the output into the patch.  Between '---' and
the diff.  U-boot is already working on making checkpatch.pl more
generic and configurable.

3.) While I'm breaking 'git format-patch' why not try to integrate a
changelog file?  eg. extract the changelog from the previous version for
each patch, and throw in a '*** ADD NEW CHANGES HERE ***'.  How to
handle collapsed patches?

4.) Build a reject filter into the mailinglist server.  If it sees
'PATCH' '[vV][0-9]' in the Subject and no In-Reply-To:, it will reject
it with a pointer to 'How to submit patches' instructions.
Additionally, it could also refuse patches without a 'git-send-email'
Message-Id:, and patches without the output of checkpatch.pl in them.
This could also be a 'Hold for moderator approval', depending on config
options.  Or, it could be implemented in the maintainers .procmailrc...

&gt;<i> &gt; See [1] for an existing gripe.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm the Peter refered to there. I also like to do patch review in the
</I>&gt;<i> mailer rather than in the browser, but it is difficult to integrate
</I>&gt;<i> that with Gerrit. Instead of asking about intent, please participate
</I>&gt;<i> in actually doing this integration.
</I>
I'm more than happy to, however, I have no maintainer experience.  I
need some insight before I invest time in creating patches.
 
...
&gt;<i> You have probably already found out that Gerrit has an SSH interface
</I>&gt;<i> besides the web interface. The SSH interface is of course much better
</I>&gt;<i> suited for integration, but so far I don't think it's possible to
</I>&gt;<i> create inline comments through it, which is the main glitch for me
</I>&gt;<i> between what I can do in my mailer and what I could do with Gerrit
</I>&gt;<i> via SSH. On the other hand the data is better structured in Gerrit
</I>&gt;<i> which is worth much more for everyone who consumes my review.
</I>
Oops, missed the ssh interface.  Thanks for pointing that out.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ago was it I last checked the pending patch list?) to get the same
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information. I also have to remember to visit the site.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again: Look at what the tool does and how it works! It is not a web

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not at all against Gerrit sending lots of email to the list, the
</I>&gt;<i> only bug is that review happening on the list will miss out on the
</I>&gt;<i> point with Gerrit. But of course ideas about how to connect the
</I>&gt;<i> glitch are very welcome.
</I>
See my ideas, above.  Admittedly, I'm trying to make existing tools do
more, not add new ones.  I've no problem with gerrit itself, I just tend
to be a minimalist when it comes to new tools in existing workflows.

&gt;<i> &gt; A new user has to work significantly harder to maintain a prolonged
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interest in the project with gerrit (imnsho).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> See other email about Gerrit sending email.
</I>
Point taken.

&gt;<i> &gt; On a personal note, I've found it much easier to contribute to u-boot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and the kernel vice cyanogenmod.  The main reason for this is the lack
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of a mailinglist for CM (they use gerrit).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is IMO not possible to replace a mailing list with a code review
</I>&gt;<i> tool. They serve different purposes and complement each other.
</I>
I agree, github, cyanogenmod and others seem to miss that...

&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe I'm odd and a one-off, but I thought it was worth mentioning
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please give yourself more freedom in shaping how the project works.
</I>&gt;<i> If you like patches to still come to the mailing list then you just
</I>&gt;<i> have to say so, don't apologize. :) And FWIW I don't think anyone is
</I>&gt;<i> against it.
</I>
Thanks, I have no problem contributing to a project, I just haven't
contributed here and didn't want to come off like a feature-requester.

&gt;<i> &gt; I'd hate to see that stream of patches and comments dissappear. :-(
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd really like a way to do inline comments via SSH. Can you think of
</I>&gt;<i> any ideas for how we could do this? Gerrit needs to know which line
</I>&gt;<i> in which file.
</I>
As seen above, my ideas are tending towards improving the existing
workflow, which may not be what you want...

&gt;<i> The quickest thing I can come up with would be to add a prefix on
</I>&gt;<i> each patch line sent in email, like 1:14 meaning file 1 this patch
</I>&gt;<i> touches, line 14 of either the patch or the file. It would cost a few
</I>&gt;<i> characters per line, but it would have the data needed for an inline
</I>&gt;<i> comment. Combine with a PGP signature (or send via SSH) and I think
</I>&gt;<i> it could work. Of course someone has to develop this software too.
</I>
This seems rather rube-goldberg-ish [1] ;-)  Assuming my ideas above
were implemented successfully (non-default options, etc), is there
anything in the maintainer workflow it doesn't cover?

thx,

Jason.
