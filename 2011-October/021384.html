<PRE>Attila,

I wouldn't mind giving them some time as long as they keep communicating
with me. I am hitting a blank wall on Amontec's side. I have tried sending
emails to their sales, customer service, their CEO and I don't get any thing
back.

Yegor,

Thanks for your reply. I searched through this mail list, it seems like
Laurent is active in this list. Unless he is out in vacation or in a
similar situation, I can't imagine he hasn't seen this email yet. I will
wait for couple of more days for him to come in touch with me. If I don't
hear anything, I don't have any other option than to check if their is a way
to cancel the credit card payment.

It's not that I need it right away. I just need to know when will I get it.
Why is it so difficult to tell your customer when the product they have
already paid for would be shipped?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does anybody here know if Amontec - makers of JTAG Tiny - company went
</I>&gt;<i> out
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of business or something?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I know, this is an off topic question. But I have exhausted all my
</I>&gt;<i> options
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; before posting it here. Since, Amontec's SDK kit supports OpenOCD, I
</I>&gt;<i> figured
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some of you might know their status.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here's the reason I asked. I bought a JTAG tiny from them like 3-4 weeks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ago. The payment went through and I haven't heard back from them. I have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tried to send multiple emails and I don't get any response back. If they
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; indeed out of business, I will have to buy another JTAG dongle. But, if
</I>&gt;<i> they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are still in business, I guess I don't have any other option than to warn
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people to not to deal with them. Well, I will wait for some of you to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; respond before I do that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've also bought one debugger from Amontec and I found the service
</I>&gt;<i> very disappointing. I've got my device after 2 month. I also got
</I>&gt;<i> almost no answers to my e-mails or phone calls. Then I wrote to this
</I>&gt;<i> list and got answer from Laurent, after that I got my device within
</I>&gt;<i> some weeks.
