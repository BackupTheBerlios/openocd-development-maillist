Have you tried with double backslash &quot;\\&quot; ?
I've become very used to windows/cygwin/openocd/eclipse/make all 
behaving very differently when it comes to slashes, and trying to make 
various different tools work together through eclipse or makefiles can 
be quite frustrating when they use incompatible paths. The same can be 
said for ' and &quot;, both can be useful in some cases when building paths 
with spaces, but both can also break things in other apps.
I don't know anything about who/what changed the handling in openocd, 
although if it's been done on purpose to make its handling more 
consistent or compatible with other parts of the toolchain I'd think 
it's worthwhile, although it doesn't sound like that is the case, it's 
certainly sounding worse in eclipse going by your description.

Either way, I generally us the \\ as the most compatible path separator 
on windoze, although there's still some apps that don't like that 
either, and it isn't any good if you want to make cross platform config 
files....
