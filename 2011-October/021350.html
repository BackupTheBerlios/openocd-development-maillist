I guess it's possible, but company owner Laurent posted to this very
mailing list a week or so ago.

Thanks for the info. Laurent and a guy that he hired to do some
development have participated on this mailing list before, so I
think they should also receive this, and will hopefully get back to
you soon.

Personally I really like the Versaloon dongle, since it is fairly
intelligent, and also open hardware, with open source firmware.

It works great with OpenOCD for JTAG, SWD I (still :/ ) haven't
tested yet.
