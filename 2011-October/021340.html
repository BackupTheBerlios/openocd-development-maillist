It is obvious that the commit is a significant improvement for life
in Tcl files, that needs no discussion. Thus, we really want it.

We can also assume that Steve did not pick this way to do the
improvement because he likes to bully Windows users, but because
it is the better way to reach the goal.

We have discovered a side effect of uplevel, so we should find out
how we can deal with that side effect, not abandon the improvement.

</I>
Maybe you, like me, roughly know the capabilities of Tcl, even if you
are not an expert? It is a pretty basic language, so it is fairly
safe to assume that there is no alternative to uplevel.


&gt;<i> while in the meantime OpenOCD would work as expected for Windows
</I>&gt;<i> users?
</I>
Of course I agree that it would be great to fix the problem quickly.
But abandoning the improvement is not the answer.


&gt;<i> &quot;The problem&quot; is that Windows paths now cannot be used normally and
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD cannot be used as before.
</I>
It is trivial to work around this problem. Open src/startup.tcl and
remove uplevel #0 from line 58, and you are done. Since
src/startup.tcl is generated during build, git will not care that it
has been changed. Of course the workaround needs to be re-applied in
case one of the .tcl files that make up startup.tcl changes, by your
hand or by a commit you fetch.


&gt;<i> Global variables thing which this patch (supposedly) improves is
</I>&gt;<i> just an improvement, because you could use globals before anyway,
</I>&gt;<i> just had to add &quot;global NAME&quot; before.
</I>
I think it's a very desirable improvement, and even though it does
not directly affect what you and I have so far focused on in OpenOCD
(ie. not .tcl files) I guess you agree that it can make a difference
for those who do work with .tcl files.

More importantly, every user is exposed to the .tcl files, so
anything that allows to simplify or clarify them is real important.


&gt;<i> Please revert to fix a real problem (removing backslashes from
</I>&gt;<i> Windows paths).
</I>
This is not the problem, this is just how double evaluation manifests
itself. Since when is treating the symptom any good?


&gt;<i> We can deal with improvement while at the same time OpenOCD works
</I>&gt;<i> as it should.
</I>
Please do deal with the improvement right away. I don't expect it
will have to be very complicated. Meanwhile, the workaround is quite
trivial.


I'm more interested in knowing if not using uplevel also changes
which directory relative paths are relative to?
