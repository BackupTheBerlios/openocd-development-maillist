There's pkg-config also for MinGW, although maybe that is perhaps
more within a full MSYS environment. The question is whether OpenOCD
already has a standalone MinGW Makefile or not. If not (only
autoconf) then I think requiring pkg-config is fine as a build
dependency.

Ok.

</I>
This is a good idea. Also, usb_reset() may not be exactly the same as
libusb_reset_device().

I think this may be largely due to the fact that libusb-0.1 was
implemented in different projects for different platforms.

It is really important to me that we make sure to have libusb-1.0
behave the same across platforms, because it is the only way we can
claim to actually have a cross-platform library.

With the exception of the still young Windows code I think we are so
far doing a fairly good job. I believe the difference between Linux
and Mac OS X were larger in libusb-0.1, so I think this code in
OpenOCD can be simplified. Let's see.


&gt;<i> &gt; Or does the driver support so many jlink devices with so many different

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is right, there are different version of J-Link with different

</I>
With the same vidpid? Meh. :(
