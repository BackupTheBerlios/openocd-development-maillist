<PRE>Moin,

Would it possible to have gerrit comments as mails to the mailinglist
as well?

My usual way of working is to go over a developement mailinglist once
every few days (when time permits) and check what has been going on.
When i see a patch that looks interesting, i go and check what has
to be done with it. On projects that handle the whole patchmanagment
on the mailinglist, this is often not necessaary, as i see in the
discussion whether this patch has allready been accepted or not,
or whether there was no discussion at all. With gerrit i first have
to open up a browser with the link to the patch, just to figure
out that the patch has been already abandoned by the author.

Hence, if possible, i'd ask to send comments to the mailinglist as
well, with correct In-Reply-To field for propper threading.

If it's not possible.. just leave it :-)
