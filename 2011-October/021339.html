What?

So you don't know how to fix that, I don't know how to fix that, but we 
cannot revert a one-line change that introduced A BUG just because it 
(supposedly - I did not check) adds some functionality that was not 
actually discussed in detail EVER?

Why can't we revert a change, fixing a bug and wait for a real 
jimtcl-expert (Steve) to discuss other alternatives while in the 
meantime OpenOCD would work as expected for Windows users?

&quot;The problem&quot; is that Windows paths now cannot be used normally and 
OpenOCD cannot be used as before. Global variables thing which this 
patch (supposedly) improves is just an improvement, because you could 
use globals before anyway, just had to add &quot;global NAME&quot; before.

Please revert to fix a real problem (removing backslashes from Windows 
paths). We can deal with improvement while at the same time OpenOCD 
works as it should.

4\/3!!
