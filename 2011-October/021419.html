You mean, this [1]?

For the record, I have been using TortoiseGit pretty much on a daily 
basis, for almost two years now and from my personal experience, not 
only have I found it filling pretty much all of my git needs (besides, 
it's based on msys-git, so commandline git is only one click away), but 
also, unlike Peter, I found that if there's one tool that benefits 
greatly from having a solid GUI, it has to be git. Who'd want to go back 
to using commandline for diffs, log, or branch switching, when you have 
a GUI with *easy* navigation at your fingertips [2]?.

Also, judging from the general praise for gerrit, which also provides a 
solid GUI frontend albeit web based (hence more complex for regular git 
users to setup on their own -- I wouldn't advocate it as a solution for 
a user who simply wants a GUI on their machine), I can only assume that 
many have come to share the view that some GUI ontop of git actually 
does wonders.

Thus, do you guys, who seem to be opposed to the use of TortoiseGit, 
have better evidence to back up your claims?

If not, I would advise Jim to take &#216;yvind and Peter's advice with a 
grain of salt, or at least also consider the advice of someone who, 
through nearly two years of continuous usage, has reason to believe that 
using TortoiseGit has actually increased their git productivity. Of 
course, just like Peter and &#216;yvind's, this is merely an opinion.

Regards,

/Pete
