I second this.

Sorry, noone has time to deal with your patch.


&gt;<i> 1. The patch is trivial
</I>
It might seem so, but actually it's not. It has multiple logical
changes combined in a single commit, which is no good. Please
separate the return error into it's own commit, with it's own clear
commit message about how and why.


&gt;<i> 2. I use git in Linux hosted in VitualBox, where emailing patches
</I>&gt;<i> kinda does not work
</I>
&#216;yvind could have written &quot;push&quot; instead of &quot;post&quot;, since commits
go to Gerrit using git push, and not email. It's clear that you
misunderstood this, and it's clear that you didn't even look into
how commits would be sent to Gerrit, before arguing that you do not
have time to do so because it is too complicated.

Your VM needs network access. I guess it has that.

On another note, it's absolutely not neccessary for you to work with
OpenOCD source code in any particular operating system. If your
prefered environment is Windows then Git can perform line ending
translation for you, allowing you to use any Windows tools to work
with any project codebase.


&gt;<i> 3. My knowledge of Linux and Git is minimal
</I>
That's not a problem. If your willingness to gain knowledge of Git is
also minimal, *that* is a big problem, since you can notwork
efficiently within the project then.

Perhaps you realize that learning a little about Git makes a huge
difference in productivity. It's of course impossible to discuss this
with someone if they have already decided that they hate Git (you
might be surprised how common this is) or that they otherwise don't
want to learn the tool.

I would see OpenOCD as an opportunity to learn more about Git, and I
would be happy that I took the opportunity, since I can benefit from
it also outside of OpenOCD. If you run into trouble then please do
ask - there are several on the mailing list who are happy to help.


&gt;<i> So basically I can say that Gerrit posting would NOT work in my
</I>&gt;<i> environment without some serious effort,
</I>
The effort in all it's seriousness is documented in HACKING. But here
are the steps again, summarized for your convenience:

* acquiring any OpenID account (let me know if you can't get one)
* registering on the Gerrit website
* configuring a username on Gerrit website
* (optional) uploading a public ssh key on Gerrit website
* adding the commit hook in your local repo
* re-committing your change (to get the Change-Id)
* git config remote.origin.url with ssh or http URL to Gerrit
* git push

The next time you've made a commit you run git push again, to send
commit(s) to Gerrit. I am confident that this is quite significantly
simpler than whatever workflow you currently use with patch files and
email software.


&gt;<i> while you can just accept that trivial patch or post it there in
</I>&gt;<i> two seconds.
</I>
Except that you can not get feedback then. Since it is your patch it
is you who needs to push it to Gerrit.


&gt;<i> I have got a lot on my head now and no time to spare.
</I>
Yeah, it takes time to learn tools, but Gerrit is really not your
enemy.


&gt;<i> Make Gerrit accept patches via web interface (I see no reason why it 
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't allow to do so as it's web based)
</I>
IMO that would be stupid. You already have the commit in Git, so it
is really impossible to have a simpler interface than git push.


&gt;<i> and I'll be happy to post anything there - now it's just like a
</I>&gt;<i> stone wall for me with milions of steps required
</I>
See above, and HACKING, for the million steps that are required.


&gt;<i> to send a patch once a year.
</I>
Next year you do it with one command. Since your VM can not send
email I know that you are not using git send-email, which would be
similarly simple as git push to Gerrit; you must be creating patch
files, and sending them manually in email. This is not efficient.

There's really no reason to be inefficient about something, even if
you only do it once a year, especially when the knowledge that allows
you to work more efficiently can benefit you for a whole year in
between.


&gt;<i> For me - a user who sometimes patches simple stuff or adds config
</I>&gt;<i> files - Gerrit is an obstacle, nothing more.
</I>
I think you should look at how Gerrit actually works, and re-evaluate
your position.


Of course, being required to even think about a new tool is a slight
inconvenience for a new contributor, but hopefully you can help
document the process, or suggest simplifications, instead of only
complaining about how difficult it is before you have any experience.

On the flip side, the value of Gerrit is significant. Commits can
very quickly and easily come into Gerrit and go out of Gerrit into
the public openocd.git repo. (You may have noticed the command line
interface via SSH that Gerrit offers.) It's also very easy to make
detailed comments on commits. &#216;yvind mentioned that Gerrit also
brings a bit of quality assurance, for free, without human
interaction.

The slight added inconvenience is instantly amortized by the added value.


&gt;<i> Sorry for the inconvenience.
</I>
Don&#836;'t apologize, just actually try Gerrit out before you complain.
