I agree strongly with this.

As for website and repositories, a lot of nice integration can be
accomplished when self hosting, as I am doing for several projects
already. I would be happy to host also the openocd repository(ies)
and set up a Trac, which includes a wiki, a ticket system, a source
code browser, and repository history view, all nicely integrated.

I am personally very strongly against depending on companies based in
the US for open source project infrastructure. I find there are quite
significant drawbacks, due to stupid US law and/or due to the service
being provided by a business with a clear agenda, which makes it an
impossible choice for any self-respecting open source project.
Already the very very first condition of github terms and many others
completely rule it out IMO:

--8&lt;-- <A HREF="http://help.github.com/terms-of-service/">http://help.github.com/terms-of-service/</A>
A. Account Terms

1. You must be 13 years or older to use this Service.
--&gt;8--

This is not significant because OpenOCD has so many contributors
under the age of 13, but because it is unacceptable IMO that it would
be *ILLEGAL* to welcome a young contributor into the project. It is
just absurd. Of course the terms continue with more great stuff.
