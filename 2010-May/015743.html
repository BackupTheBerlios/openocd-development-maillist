<PRE>I've been trying to get a trace out of my DM355 with ETM v1.3 and ETB; I've been reading ARM IHI0014O and the OOCD source code but struggling to get a trace out.

ETM is configured in target/ti_dm355.cfg and I try to setup a trace as follows:

# (power board on)
reset init
# setup trace to always-on ref IHI0014O p. 3-41 &quot;Tracing all memory&quot;
reg ETM_trace_resource_ctrl 0
reg ETM_trace_en_ctrl1 0x1000000
reg ETM_trace_en_ctrl2 0
reg ETM_trace_en_event 0x6f
etm start
resume
etm status
reg ETM_status

If I understand the datasheet correctly I want to see ETM_status bit 2 set (Trace stop/start status bit). &quot;etm status&quot; always shows &quot;etb: idle&quot;.

Whatever I do, &quot;etm analyze&quot; always comes back empty. I added a print which shows me that ctx-&gt;trace_depth is always 0.

I have also tried setting the trigger like this (inside a small idle loop in u-boot)

reg ETM_trig_event 0
reg ETM_addr_1_comparator_value 0x8108a7ec
reg ETM_addr_1_access_type 0x19

but that has no obvious effect.

Anyone who has successfully used the ETM/ETB with OpenOCD I'd love to hear any recipies, online documentation, etc.

etm info reports:
&gt;<i> etm info
</I>ETM v1.3
pairs of address comparators: 4
data comparators: 2
memory map decoders: 8
number of counters: 2
sequencer present

number of ext. outputs: 1
FIFO full present
protocol version: 7
max. port size: 16
half-rate clocking not supported
full-rate clocking supported
normal trace format supported
multiplex trace format not supported
demultiplex trace format not supported
FIFO full supported

Thanks,
