It has a couple of warning shots along the lines of &quot;seems not well used yet&quot; and that there are no TCL helpers to set up common scenarios.

I couldn't get it to produce a trace, but I have never touched an ETM/ETB before so maybe I was doing something wrong. I don't feel qualified enough to make any documentation/TODO patches.
