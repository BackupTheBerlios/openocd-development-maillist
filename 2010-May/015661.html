<PRE>Hi,
branch &quot;cfi&quot; inside
<A HREF="http://git.infradead.org/users/borneoa/openocd.git">http://git.infradead.org/users/borneoa/openocd.git</A>
contains a set of patches I would propose for being merged in OpenOCD.

My development is mainly a review of memory accesses to CFI flash to
guarantee that every access is performed at CFI bus_width size.
Current version of OpenOCD does not strictly obey to such role, using
mix of 8, 16 and 32 bit read accesses.
As you could imagine, I'm working on a target that does not like so
much all this flexibility.

a) if you want to test my tree, focus on :
     1) verify your config file handle properly the line &quot;flash bank
... cfi ...&quot;.
        This is supposed to work for every TCL script inside OpenOCD,
        but a custom configuration could fail.
     2) check you get correct flash ID as output of &quot;flash probe 0&quot;
     3) check the flash can be properly written

b) I still need to fix the code for erase_check. This is the last
missing piece, but requires some time.

c) I have noticed that the assembly code for flash programming in
   cfi_intel_write_block() and cfi_spansion_write_block() is for ARM only,
   while CFI is used also for MIPS cores (./tcl/board/x300t.cfg)!
   Is this a bug? It is not in the tracker.
   Is anyone already working at moving this part in target specific files?

One of the commits is a rewrite of my former patch, posted on March 24 as
&gt;<i> [RFC/PATCH] CFI: simplify bufferwsize computation
</I>now obsoleted.

Best Regards,
Antonio Borneo
