<PRE>My ARM board doesn't have SRST wired up, so I am using a software reset (watchdog timer).

This works most of the time but just failed with the core in &quot;Abort&quot; mode, and immediately after I got a lot of &quot;Address translation failure&quot;.

Is there something I should do in my software reset routine to make it more robust? Explicitly set the processor mode perhaps? I looked in the docs but couldn't see how to do that.

My reset routine just calls &quot;halt&quot; at the moment then starts trying to set the WDT with &quot;mww phys&quot; calls.

Some output when things went wrong:

watchdog_reset called
target state: halted
target halted in ARM state due to debug-request, current mode: Abort
cpsr: 0x200000d7 pc: 0xffff000c
MMU: enabled, D-Cache: enabled, I-Cache: enabled
watchdog_reset done
target state: halted
target halted in ARM state due to debug-request, current mode: Abort
cpsr: 0x200000d7 pc: 0xffff035c

When things go right (although the pc usually shows 0x20, not sure what happened this time..)
