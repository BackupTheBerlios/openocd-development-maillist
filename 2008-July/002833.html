</I>After taking a quick look, I wold say that the code where things happen, 
armv4_5_run_algorithm is not  safe and does not perform as intended. It 
only works most of the time.
If there is an existing hw breakpoint in  the memory block where the 
algoritm code is loaded to, then bad things will happen.
So even without the  problem of not having enough breakpoints, when 
running algorithms on the target we probably should
disable all application breakpoints, and then restore them when resuming 
the  application.
&gt;<i> This would have to be done *everywhere* in the code and at that point I'd
</I>&gt;<i> rather place this responsibility with the debugger, which can enable/disable
</I>&gt;<i> breakpoints before/after stepping/running.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>This should probably be done in the &quot;target-&gt;run_algoritm&quot; functions, 
yes several places :), and not  by gdb or tcl scripting since this 
problem will apply every time an algoritm is run on the target and it 
should be fixed in the core C code.

Magnus
