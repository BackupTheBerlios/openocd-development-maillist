Subject: jtag_speed and auto_probe

Hi &#216;yvind and List,

I am opposed to the current jtag_speed and auto_probe functionality. I want to recommend that OCD is reverted to the old functionality where only a single JTAG speed is specified (no &quot;pre&quot; and &quot;post&quot; reset speed). I also want to recommend that auto_probe is removed. Here is why.

Take the AT91SAM9260 as example. Attached are my configuration scripts and batch files to launch OCD and Insight. There is also an error log that shows that auto_probe fails.

The AT91SAM9260's JTAG speed must always be 6 times lower than its clock speed. Let's say one was busy with a debugging session where the AT91SAM9260's clock speed was 100 MHz and the JTAG Speed set to 6 MHz. If one wants to start a new debugging session, you have to follow the following steps:

1. Set OCD JTAG Speed to 5 kHz in anticipation of reset, where the clock speed of the AT91SAM9260 will drop to 32kHz and enable the User Reset on the AT91SAM9260 (achieved in &quot;at91sam9260_pre_reset.script&quot;).

2. Perform a &quot;reset init&quot; which resets and halts the AT91SAM9260 and then executes &quot;at91sam9260_post_reset.script&quot;. OCD JTAG Speed should still be 5kHz.

3. After reset and in &quot;at91sam9260_post_reset.script&quot; one wants to speed up JTAG speed asap. Therefore the crystal and PLL is enabled first.

4. Now one can set the JTAG Speed to 6 MHz.

5. Thereafter one wants to enable the external memories, e.g. FLASH and SDRAM.

I just wanted to illustrate that the notion of pre and post reset JTAG Speed is vague (exactly when does the change occur?) and I would leave it to the scripter to decide when the JTAG speed should be changed. The old way is still supported, but I would remove the new stuff, because of the ambiguities.

On to auto_probe...

If you look at &quot;log.txt&quot;. You will see that auto_probe fails. I did not dig into the source code to find out why, but I suspect that auto_probe is asynchronous and does not happen at the appropriate moment.

I have indicated the appropriate moment in &quot;at91sam9260_post_reset.script&quot; with the line &quot;flash probe 0&quot;, i.e. after the AT91SAM9260 is at the proper clock speed and the External FLASH interface is properly set up.

It should also be synchronous.

That's my two cents worth.

Kind regards,
Pieter Conradie

Subject: [Openocd-development] Fix GDB timeout error messages

Committed

1. GDB will print cryptic error messages if it is not fed keep-alive packets
within the last 2000ms.

To fix this, add keep_alive() if you are spending &gt;1000ms in an algorithm
thus holding up the server loop.

target_call_timer_callbacks() invokes keep_alive().

2. post_reset script is now executed at normal JTAG speed and not
reset speed.

3. Resume is now synchronous again. Hopefully it will work this time.


Example of GDB error message:

Ignoring packet error, continuing...
Reply contains invalid hex digit 116

and the warning now printed:

keep_alive() was not invoked in the 1000ms timelimit. GDB alive packet not sent!
 (1020)
