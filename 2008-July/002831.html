<PRE>&gt;<i> You could define a few step/breakpoint commands in tcl that has this
</I>&gt;<i> functionality. The existing functions would then be the low level implementation
</I>&gt;<i> of hardware/software breakpoints.
</I>
with the &quot;breakpoints list/save/restore&quot; patch one can use a similar script:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
reset
sleep 1000

arm7_9 fast_memory_access enable
arm7_9 dcc_downloads enable
str9x flash_config 0 4 2 0 0x80000

# save breakpoints
bpsave bp.bpt
# remove all breakpoints
rbp

flash protect 0 0 7 off
flash write_image erase prog.elf
flash protect 0 0 7 on

verify_image prog.elf

# restore breakpoints
script bp.bpt

resume

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;<i> This isn't a problem when debugging with GDB, is it?
</I>
no

&gt;<i> How do you propose to deal with this from a users point of view?
</I>
The first issue for users (like me) is to be aware of risks and problems.
When a user execute:

&gt;<i> load_image zero.img 0x50000000 bin
</I>256 byte written at address 0x50000000
downloaded 256 byte in 0.015625s

openocd says everything is ok but is not (not always) true.

Some idea can be:

- In the default scripts add a comment like &quot;this area is reserved for the
  debugger and should not be used by the application&quot;
- Set 'backup' as default
- In the default scripts set a 'working_area' at the end of internal SRAM
  (where is the stack? where is the heap?)
- chek overlapping of 'working_area' and image load in the load_image implementation (this should be 
easy and mandatory)
  - if possible, allocate the 'working_area' needed for the algorithm outside
    of the loading image space (but inside the 'working_area' defined in the config file)
  - if not enough space (e.g. the loading image space completely overlaps the
    'working_area' defined in the config file) give an error and do not load
    or load without dcc (or at least tell the user to disable dcc)

Regards,
        Dario
