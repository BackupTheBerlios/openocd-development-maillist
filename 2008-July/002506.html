<PRE>duane&gt; should we generate a different output for each of these languages?

&#216;yvind&gt; I have explained this badly because you completely misunderstand me.

No, I understood you completely. 

Sorry for my long reply - but I feel it is the only way to explain this 
- for I think the 5th time - (not to you, but to others also)

I would love to hear what others think of this.

-Duane.

BTW -
    Please do not take, or think this is a rant - or ever - it is not at 
all intended that way.

==================

&#216;yvind defines or declare the &quot;programing API as some internal tcl 
representation&quot; - aka: effectively A TCL list object. Using &#216;yvind's 
example - &quot;flash_banks&quot; in earlier email - it returns its results like this:

    {ecosflash 16777216 2097152 2 2}

&#216;yvind's view is: the host side application can choose

(A) use it as is or
(B) make it better so they can more easily parse the result.

It is up to the host side application writer to decide what to do.

We programmers are lazy people, most if not all host applications *WILL* 
code to the supplied API.

When dealing with other external projects - every project will 
compromise far to much - often because they have no choice.
As &#216;yvind put it in an earlier email [me asking about a cortex #define 
vrs command]

 &gt;&gt; Can we simply hardcode the least of evils and delete hacks once
 &gt;&gt; GDB catches up? (I believe we're waiting for a new and improved GDB
 &gt;&gt; here?).

I repeat:

We programmers are lazy people, most host applications *WILL* code to 
the supplied API.

And add...

Often we have no other practical choice.

=========================================
Where &#216;yvind and I differ is here:
=========================================

The best analogy I can think of is &#216;yvind wants to offer an &quot;old fashion 
C structure initialization&quot;- like this:
(In reality, without the commas - it is a TCL list)

    struct flash_banks data = { &quot;ecosflash&quot; , 16777216 , 2097152 , 2,  2 };

If one element is added - in the wrong place - or - something is moved - 
BOOM - nothing works. A classic &quot;off-by-one&quot; bug.

If I understand the code correctly, if I used &quot;C99&quot; style syntax - it is 
this:

    struct flash_banks data = {
        .name = &quot;ecosflash&quot;,
        .base  = 16777216,
        .size = 2097152,
        .bus_width = 2,
       .chip_width = 2
    }

The C99 method is *immune* to the off-by-one bug.  It is very robust.

It is a C99 style reply that I strongly advocate

Some believe it is overly complicated, perhaps they do not see what I see.

=========================================
Problem Example:
=========================================

Today - we have exactly 1 command - the one &#216;yvind wrote, and it has an 
*exact* example of the problem that i do not want to see happen.

Can somebody fix this:

    In the &quot;flash_banks&quot; the field num_sectors field is missing.

How can this be fixed?

Please do not break any host side application that coded to the exactly 
5 item response

And - do not change the parameter order - many other apps hard code that 
specific order.

Remember: Tomorrow will happen again - if not this command the next 
command will have this problem.

This problem is worse with the &quot;flash info&quot; command.

=========================================
Also - note:
=========================================

If anybody adds 1 item - or changes the order in an &quot;un-tagged&quot; 
structure - BOOM!

An off by one error - agh... nasty.

Put another way - earlier in email about &quot;openocd &amp; cortex &amp; gdb&quot; - and 
the #if define.

 &gt;&gt; Can we simply hardcode the least of evils and delete hacks once
 &gt;&gt; GDB catches up? (I believe we're waiting for a new and improved GDB
 &gt;&gt; here?).

The same problem - only in a different form.

=========================================
This problem has been solved, long ago by smart people.
=========================================

This guy wrote the most successful over the wire protocol in the world, HTTP
Not surprisingly - I think the C99 feature - and it has a common theme.

Look carefully at how the HTTP protocol is implemented - and how 
flexible it has been.

    Initially - 1.0
    Later they added cookies.
    Later they added caching,
    Later they added proxy stuff
    Later they added MIME type.
    Later ... they keep adding things.
    Today.... wow!

Yet, all of the old browsers still (reasonably work) as do old servers.

That is an extremely robust and adaptable protocol beyond measure.

We can easily emulate a small core feature of that protocol.
We only need to stand on the shoulders of giants.

Effectively, the protocol is a &quot;remote procedure call&quot; - with many 
parameters - all done as ascii text.

=========================================
Some detail - about how utterly simple HTTP is.
=========================================

HTTP in a nut shell works like this:

1) Connect, and send an HTTP request.

   Each requests consists of:
          1 or more non-blank lines of simple &quot;name-value&quot; ascii text.
    The request ends with a blank line.

    There can be many names and values.
    Names do not need to be unique.
    Names &amp; values can come in any *reasonable* order.
    If the server does not understand or use the 'name-value&quot; it ignores it.
    This solves &quot;backward compatibility&quot;.

    Each name-value (non-blank line) of the request has the following 
format:
  
            &lt;NAME&gt;  &lt;COLON&gt; &lt;SPACE&gt;  &lt;some-text&gt; &lt;end-of-line&gt;

    At least - one &quot;name&quot; is required - the &quot;command&quot; to the server.

   This name-value format is analogous to the C99 name/value structure 
stuff.
 
2) The HTTP response always includes a &quot;response header&quot;.

    The response header is in the *exact* same format as a request.
    Like a request, the response ends in a blank line.
    Non blank lines contain: Name &amp; Value.
    Like a request, the client can ignore all unknown &quot;name-value&quot; pairs.

3) The response if needed - can contain a &quot;data phase&quot;.
    Data begins after that 1st blank line.

    Data ends - when either
    (A) the connection is closed Or -
    (B) the sender *may* optionally include a header element containing 
data length.

4) As a performance improvement -
    If Option (B) [header contains length] is used, the connection can 
remain open and an additional request can occur.

It is utterly simple and very robust.

And I am leaving out a vast amount of detail.

=========================================   

FYI - &quot;SMTP&quot; (email) is stored the same way -
  
            name: value
            name: value
            &lt;blank line&gt;
            Message body...

=========================================   

I believe OpenOCD should use that simple &quot;name value&quot; &amp; blank line 
concept for 'over the wire' remote program type control.

It is *IMPERATIVE* to get the core API correct.

If we do not - we will pay that price forever and a day.

We are talking about 1 computer - one openocd.
Often times - both are simply: &quot;localhost&quot;.
Often times - bit-banging the parallel port.

Performance is not an issue here - this is not the 'www.google.com' of 
JTAG controllers.

=========================================   

As I described in earlier email, the *WIRE*LINE* protocol request should 
be simple - like this:

    tcl:      flash_banks
    &lt;blankline&gt;

The response is:

    status:   error
    human:   Some Human Error Message
    &lt;blank line&gt;

or:
    status:   warning
    human:   some human error message
    &lt;blank line&gt;

or
    status:   ok
    name: ecosflash
    base: 16777216
    size: 2097152
    bus_width: 2
    chip_width: 2
    &lt;blank line&gt;

=========================================   

The trick here is create an example - in many script languages with a 
*PROPER* parser
that properly adheres to the rules we want to create. Like:

    random order of name &amp; values 
    How to ignore things that are unknown.
    How to handle very long lines.
    How to handle the &quot;data phase&quot;.
    Blank Line Ends.

There should be 2 core example functions:

    Send command.

    Read Reply.

If done right - that code will be copied &amp; pasted into every host side 
application.

And - the host side application will be as robust as the sample examples 
we give.

=========================================  

Getting this API right - now - will have great benefit later.
