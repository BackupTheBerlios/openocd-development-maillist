<PRE>Hello,

I have been thinking about this yesterday night and I think the
solution already was already suggested in the forum thread:
<A HREF="http://forum.sparkfun.com/viewtopic.php?t=7841&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=45&amp;sid=45354d14976fd68c1fa088693f66ed7f">http://forum.sparkfun.com/viewtopic.php?t=7841&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=45&amp;sid=45354d14976fd68c1fa088693f66ed7f</A>

The fact is that openOCD tries to validate the JTAG chain without
looking at the config file, only using the JTAG standards. This is
done in the jtag_validate_chain function. The fact is that this
function fails with the i.MX31 because the third device on the inner
chain is not compliant with the JTAG specification. If we skip this
validation stage, the further steps seem to work with i.MX31
(jtag_examine_chain succeeds afterwards, tested right now).

There could be an easy solution, to give an option in the config file
so that this step is skipped in the initialisation process. But this
is maybe an overkill, since in our case, only the third device on the
chain is not compliant.

The second option, would be that for any device in the chain, we could
give an option that this device should not be validated. The problem
is that according to Dominic on the forum thread, the
jtag_validate_chain does not look at the config file (it is not its
task). But I cannot see another way to support, as Dominic says it,
broken designs like i.MX31.

Since this touches to deep openOCD internals, we should discuss on how
to implement this on the list before we try to implement something.

Feedback very appreciated.

Regards

Valentin
