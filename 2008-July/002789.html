There is a lot of history here and I think that there could be some cleanup
and simplifications now that a targets responsibilities have crystalized more.

Also, there is some desire to make targets more instruction set independent
in their definition.

There is a desire to stay away from C/C++, but of course object oriented
ideas w/inheritance comes to mind w/polymorphism.

A target can be a CPU(different instruction sets and subtypes of instruction
sets), non-CPU families, flash chips, FPGAs, etc.

Other contributors are *not* keen on C/C++. See earlier discussion.

Here is a thought: lets try to strip down the target definitions and
push more into scripting :-) That way we at least get a crisper
definition of targets. This should be good in terms of adding
support for non-ARM targets too.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ===========================
</I>&gt;<i> (a)   example - top part of &quot;target.c' - target_init()
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    does this:
</I>&gt;<i>                target-&gt;type-&gt;examined = 0;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Generally, the idea of &quot;type&quot; is a C version of a C++ method table.
</I>&gt;<i>    (or what ever its you call it)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    That I would think - should be *READONLY* - because
</I>&gt;<i>          target-&gt;type-&gt;examined
</I>&gt;<i>    is for *ALL* targets of that type.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    *NOT* the specific target in question.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    I would have expected:   target-&gt;examined instead.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    In effect, &quot;target_type_t&quot; should be a CONST... should it not?
</I>
I would like target to be a straight C++ class, so we could use
inheritance, resource tracking &amp; exceptions. :-)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ===========================
</I>&gt;<i> (b) I have been burned by this a few times - GDB goes out in La-La Land..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    In src/server/gdbserver.c - gdb_read_memory_packet()
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    If the requested address + the length causes it to wrap... GDB is
</I>&gt;<i> generally lost and should be told to pound sand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    This is really true @ startup - if the program counter is some how
</I>&gt;<i> reported as -2
</I>&gt;<i>    (Why it is - I do not know.... but it happens some times for me - I
</I>&gt;<i> wish i knew)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    And at that point - GCC appears to proceed to try to disassemble
</I>&gt;<i> 4gig of memory...
</I>
Nice... GDB is clearly busted here.

Perhaps GDB will work, if we fail to read that memory?

The right place to fix this would be in target_read/write_memory though...

How's the attached patch?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I added this - it seems to help - but I am sure about it. If it is
</I>&gt;<i> obvious - I suggest someone fix it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    // about line 1050 in gdb_server.c
</I>&gt;<i>    if( (addr+len) &lt; addr ){
</I>&gt;<i>        /* memory wraps! */
</I>&gt;<i>        retval == ERROR_TARGET_DATA_ABORT;
</I>&gt;<i>    } else {
</I>&gt;<i>        retval = target_read_buffer(target, addr, len, buffer);
</I>&gt;<i>    }
</I>
I want this fixed in target_read/write_buffer()...

Note that we *have to* fail the packet if the requested amount of memory
is more than a couple of k's. GDB has code to split up memory read/write
packets, so anything above this fragmentation limit really is a pathological
sign.
