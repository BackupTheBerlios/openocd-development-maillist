<PRE>&gt;<i> When I found the bug
</I>&gt;<i> - my target was running
</I>&gt;<i> - the OpenOCD was running
</I>&gt;<i> - I realized that my application was locked, i.e. it must have crashed
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere, or entered some infinite loop
</I>&gt;<i> - I wanted to know where my application was, and possibly examine some data,
</I>&gt;<i> registers etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In that case, there's absolutely no reason why starting GDB and connecting to
</I>&gt;<i> the OpenOCD should result in stale/bogus data being presented to the user.
</I>&gt;<i> The halt might take a while (~1s with jtag_speed 1400), but the target can
</I>&gt;<i> easily enter debug state, and by the time it is halted we have reliable data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Do you specifically mean that the target should be halted, if possible,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> before replying to the register packet?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, that's what GDB expects, isn't it? Upon connection, GDB believes the
</I>&gt;<i> target is halted, and queries its current state (e.g. 'g' packet).
</I>
That's right: the GDB model is broken here.

It doesn't really support the concept of *attaching* to a target, which we
need here. If GDB does support this, the by all means, prove me wrong
by telling me how :-)

GDB wants to attach to the target and have the target in the halted state.

w/e.g. Visual C++ debugger, when one attaches to a process, that process
continues to run until halted. Same thing would be nice w/GDB.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are a couple of things that need to line up just right:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - we need to allow GDB connections to dead or unresponsive targets. This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is to allow users to have monitor commands in the GDB init script to set
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> things up.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - we need to respond immediately to the connect, or we get weird error
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> messages that are pretty much impossible to deduce anything from, it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just looks like  OpenOCD or GDB is broken)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You forgot:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - we must not reply with bogus/stale data. if we absolutely must reply with
</I>&gt;<i> bogus data we should at least inform the user...
</I>
That is is imperative, does make a patch that solves all the problems
materialize
out of thin air.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You didn't include a -d3 log, so I don't know much about what happened
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in your debug session.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've already sent the -d3 log last night:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2008-July/002756.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2008-July/002756.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Perhaps we can get rid of the white lie upon connect, but for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> now it seems like the best option.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Perhaps waiting 500ms for the halted state will do the trick?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks a lot, looks like that worked. Do you know how much time we have here?
</I>
Nope.

&gt;<i> Would it be possible to keep GDB going with the empty reply packets we send
</I>&gt;<i> in keep_alive?
</I>
The keep_alive() trick only works when the target is in the running state,
or executing a monitor command.

Actually... perhaps you have the solution right there.

Add a &quot;monitor wait_halt&quot; at the beginning of your GDB init script.

This will wait upto 5 seconds and afterwards the PC should be correct.

A robust approach would then be:

- we do nothing when connecting to the target. We don't even issue a halt.
Remove the current &quot;target_halt&quot; even.
- lie to the GDB register packet that GDB insists on sending upon startup
and return garbage.
- require the user to add in GDB commands to halt the target. &quot;monitor
reset init&quot;,
&quot;monitor halt&quot;, &quot;stepi&quot;, &quot;monitor wait_halt&quot;, etc. Note that monitor
halt is synchronous.
