&gt;<i> Hello List,

I tried it a couple of days ago and it worked. Will try
more. The stuff in trunk is currently very much work
in progress, though it looks like we're making
things better and not worse from here on.

We have talked about having release/stable branches
in the past and development in trunk. A stable branch
would be cut at some version of trunk. The latest stuff
in branch is the latest stuff being worked on and
will not be as stable as a stable/release branch.

&gt;<i> I have the feeling that more and more features
</I>&gt;<i> with the scripting was implemented but no one
</I>&gt;<i> had test if GDB is still working.
</I>
There is one major change/bugfix to look out for:

if there is an error in a script, then the script is now aborted. An
error message is shown w/file &amp; line number where execution
was halted.

This change was intentional and the choice was
made this way to be more consistent w/error message
&amp; exceptions.

Of course there is a compatibility cost, but long term I'm convinced
that this was the right decision.

Is this what you are seeing?

&gt;<i> It would be a good idea to use a FT2232 device as a
</I>&gt;<i> reference to check if the debug functionality is still
</I>&gt;<i> working, please!
</I>
trunk is not quite yet ready for regression testing yet,
but any specifc reports, I try to address as
quickly as possible.

A lot of other contributors are also pitching in.

It is especially nice to see that we have some excellent
new names to the OpenOCD contributors list(which
is pretty long by now).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are some examples under testing\example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An other problem I have found is that the windows
</I>&gt;<i> slash &quot;\&quot; is still not working anymore in the command line:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> openocd -f .\prj\jtagkey.cfg
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> is still not working, now the &quot;/&quot; must be used:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> openocd -f ./prj/jtagkey.cfg
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But in this case the &quot;auto completion&quot; with the tab under
</I>&gt;<i> windows to complete the path will not work.
</I>
This particular problem should be made no better or
worse with the scripting work. There have probably
been outstanding problems with the Windows version
that we should take the occasion to fix.

The &quot;find&quot; command encapsulates the search path code.

Please try the following from a telnet session:

&gt;<i> find ./prj/tagkey.cfg
</I>=&gt; result?
&gt;<i> find .\prj\jtagkey.cfg
</I>=&gt; result?
&gt;<i> find xxx
</I>=&gt; result?
&gt;<i> find target/at91eb40a.cfg
</I>=&gt; result?
