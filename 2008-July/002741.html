I've done some reading - What I have to say will take a while to digest.
So think about it for a little bit - you might need to read this a few
times.

To resolve the &quot;process_reset&quot; - I think we need to tackle some lower
level things first.

For example - we need a &quot;target&quot; that is in TCL style first.

This is important - because:

The higher level scripts will need to invoke specific things on each
target in some order.

Details follow:

-Duane.

=========
Background:
=========

I'm not sure if you (or others) have done TK stuff - the graphics side
of TCL or not. Basically, in Tcl/TK when you create a &quot;button&quot; - you
create a new command that is specific to that button. In TK there are
two ways of creating a button:

(1) Specifying lots of options all at once... when creating.

       button  .foobar  -background red -foreground green -font 10x20
-text &quot;Hi Mom&quot;

OR (2) - Creating the button, then modifying the button using the new
command.

       button .foobar [with no options]

      Which - creates a new command, in this case called &quot;.foobar&quot;.

       Which you can &quot;configure&quot; as desired, for example:

          .foobar configure -background red -foreground green
          .foobar configure -font 10x20 -text &quot;Hi Mom&quot;
          .foobar -command { puts &quot;Hi duane&quot; }

When we create a target, - like the button example above - we need to
create a new command for that target.

=========
The New &quot;target&quot; command.
=========

I propose a new &quot;target&quot; command - that works like the Tcl/TK button
command does.

For compatibility reasons only...
          if argv[0] = is a known target type, ie: &quot;arm7tdmi&quot; or &quot;cortex_m3&quot;
          we assume all other parameters are positional.

If the argv[0] is not a known target type, we do something else.
     We demand it be one of these 4 things:

(1)     target create NAME [configure options]
             [ as described above, sort of like 'button']

(2)     target delete NAME
              [Destroys a target.]

(3)     target invoke NAME COMMAND
             [see below, same as: &quot;NAME COMMAND&quot;]

(4)     target list
         [You use it like this:]

          proc poll_all_targets {
                  foreach T [ target list ] {
                           $T poll
                 }
          }

==========
TK Events - but OpenOCD events.
==========

TK has a command called &quot;bind&quot;.

You can use the BIND command to BIND X-window events to specific Tcl
Procedures.

We need something similar -an-  EVENT command.
{If you can suggest a better name... please do} it would work like this:

    eventcommand  NAME   -command  &quot;some command&quot;

Some ideas/examples would be:

       eventcommand  gdbconnect   -command &quot;source gdb-connect-script&quot;

       eventcommand  prereset   -command &quot;DO SOMETHING...&quot;

Other names could be:

          gdbdisconnect
          gdbstep
          ... you name it ...

This would roughly replace what is today: target_invoke_script()

==========
The key here is: &quot;target invoke NAME COMMAND&quot;.
==========

there are two ways of invoking a TARGET command.
Option 1 -
       target invoke NAME COMMAND

Or Option 2
       Because the 'target create' created a new command..
       You can do this instead:

       NAME COMMAND

==========
This is important because:
==========

This lets higher level scripts invoke certain target specific function
calls.

For example, STEP 1 - create target called &quot;T_foobar&quot;.

     target create T_foobar -type arm7tdmi -endian little -chainpos 3
-varient xyz

We now have a &quot;T_foobar&quot; command we later can create these commands.

          T_foobar halt
          T_foobar step
          T_foobar ... what ever ...

For example - today the &quot;mww&quot; only works with the current target.
Yes, you *can* use the &quot;targets&quot; command to change targets - by number.

But with the new idea - we can eventually can do this:

          T_foobar poke32 0x1234 0xdeadbeef
          set VALUE [ T_foobar peek16 0x44432]

Or
          T_foobar step -  which ONLY steps the target named T_foobar
          T_foobar reg NAME  VALUE

==========
What I need right now to redo process_reset is something like this:
==========

          T_foobar  reset assert  [calls the assert reset]
          T_foobar  reset deassert [ calls the other function ]

    The above &quot;come along for free&quot; - with this.

==========
I also need a &quot;jtag&quot; command of some sort.
==========

Specifically - i need something that lets me mess with or &quot;enque&quot; commands.
Or at least &quot;execute the que&quot;.

Today - there are many commands like:

       jtag_khz
       jtag_nsrt_delay
    .. and others ..

There is nothing that does:   jtag_execute_queue()

====
Thus, one can do this:
====

    During the various &quot;reset&quot; steps.  Events occur.
    if an event procedure is defined for that event - it is invoked.

    In each of those events - a specific target command can occur.
    One can now - define the &quot;post-reset&quot; event procedure to

       1) Halt target FOO - because there is no other way.
       2) Set target FOO register: PC to 0xFFFF0000

    And other complicated things - like:
        starting with a slow jtag speed.
        Programing the clocks &amp; sdram
        Changing the jtag speed to fast
