<PRE>sorry for the top posting, my email client is not good with html
My thoughts are that your target should already be halted before gdb
connects, as are using reset_init.
This would be place to start looking.

Subject: [Openocd-development] auto_probe fails,because of premature GDB
&quot;qXfer:memory-map:read::&quot;



Hi List,

 

I think I narrowed down my problem with auto_probe failing. See previous
e-mail for set up and logs. This was produced on OpenOCD, SVN 734 and an
AT91SAM9260 with Intel NOR FLASH attached (CFI).

 

The first thing that GDB/Insight does is to send a &quot;qXfer:memory-map:read::&quot;
command, even before executing the automatic GDB script
(program_and_debug.gdb) that resets the target with &quot;monitor reset&quot; and puts
it into the proper state for flash probing to work.

 

In gdb_server.c, line 1571, the following line is executed:

 

p = get_flash_bank_by_num(i);

 

It fails and generates the following error message in the log:

 

Error:   96 2540 flash.c:219 get_flash_bank_by_num(): auto_probe failed -304

 

-304 = ERROR_TARGET_NOT_HALTED

 

I'm not sure how to go about fixing this. As a workaround, I start a Telnet
session first and reset the target, before starting a GDB/Insight session.
