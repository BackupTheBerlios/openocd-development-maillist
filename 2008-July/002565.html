Allright, that would be fine.

&gt;<i> &gt; - One user told me how things like the target library seemed to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; over-engineered to him. That's exactly my feeling.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm looking forward to more detailed explanations of such concerns
</I>&gt;<i> in this mailing list. The above is too general to comment usefully. Also
</I>&gt;<i> a little bit  non sequitor for the scripting topic.
</I>
It was mentioned when we talked about the tcl stuff, that's why I included it 
in my mail. My own concerns are the same as always - while trying to be 
smarter than the user things get unnecessarily complex.

&gt;<i> &gt; - Jim is licensed under Apache license V2, which is listed as being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; incompatible with GPLv2 on the FSF page. Large parts of the OpenOCD are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; licensed under the terms of GPLv2 or later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> jifl on ecos-discuss is looking into this, so it will get sorted
</I>&gt;<i> one way or another or we can switch to a different scripting engine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The eCos guys are pretty paranoid + FSF holds the copyright for
</I>&gt;<i> FSF, so this will get *thorough* attention, but it may take some time. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If a single OpenOCD executable would do, then that would be nice, but
</I>&gt;<i> we're also looking into ways of allowing the scripting be handled outside
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD.
</I>
I'm looking forward to the outcome of this.

Regards,

Dominic
