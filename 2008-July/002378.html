====== ====== ====== ====== ====== ======

Attached is a *far* larger and *far* more complete patch for Jim/TCL - 
w/ OpenOCD.
that fixes many problems and extends Jim/TCL a bit.

--Duane Ellis.

Attached files are:  

=====================
CHANGELOG_for_SVN.gz
=====================
    A roughly 'changelog' format list of changes.
    You can use these to review the changes
    and for commentary during SVN commit.

=====================
openocd-big-tcljim-patch.gz
=====================
    A large patch - (to SVN HEAD) that fixes many problems with JIM.

Major highlights are: [This was part of my previous patch, which is 
re-included here]

(1) This did not work:
            puts [format &quot;0x%08x&quot;  0x1234]
(2) This did not work:
            puts [format &quot;%d %d&quot;  123 456]
(3) The only thing that worked was:  &quot;%s&quot; and &quot;%c&quot; and &quot;%d&quot;
    And you could only have 1 &quot;%&quot; item in the string.

(4) Output from TCL commands did not goto the &quot;command window&quot;
    Example - in GDB type:   mon puts &quot;Hello world&quot;
    Example - in TELNET type:  puts &quot;Hello world&quot;
    Now, output from TCL works as you would expect.

=====================
src_tcl.tar.gz
=====================

NOTE: I hope to have some more TCL files shortly to do some more - ie: wiggle GPIO pins from the script.

&#216;yvind Harobe had previously asked:

&gt;&gt;<i>  Are there any willing testers out there for OpenOCD Tcl scripting?
</I>
So I tried lots of stuff. Having written *LOTS* of Tcl/Tk stuff in the past...[google: duane ellis insight] I found many basic bugs with the Tcl/Tk JIM implimentation - 99% fixed above There are still lingering problems with JIM - BTW - how can we fit SPOCK, BONES, and crew into this?

In the attached &quot;src_tcl.tar.gz&quot; file are many TCL scripts that implement helper functions that only begin to display the ASIC registers in some of the Atmel SAM7 parts.

These of course - require the above fixes to Jim and the new C/TCL/Jim function to work.

To try them out - (a) apply the patch (b) drop these files into the ${openocd}/src/tcl directory.
Build - and install.

Assuming you have a target you can talk to - it does not need to be a SAM7 ... it would  help... but it should work provided the target memory can be read at the address... and does not abort.

NOTE: MOST ARMS (AR7/ARM9) (not cortex) have their interrupt controller at the end of memory in about the same place - it should work - but you'll get wacky looking numbers, but you'll get a feel for how well it works.

Do the following:

After you have attached to the target, type this command in GDB (or TELNET)

Step 1:
(gdb) mon source [find tcl/chip/atmel/at91/at91sam7x256.tcl]

Step 2:
(gdb) mon show_AIC

There are *MANY* other &quot;show_THINGS&quot; - see the file:

	src_tcl.tar.gz(README) for details about TCL
	And - a short intro to tcl and how I made these things work.


The &quot;show_AIC&quot; is a TCL command that reads the interrupt controller and displays
the state of various registers. A very helpful thing.

If you have ever used commercial development tools - this is a common feature
	ie: Blackfin tools
	ie: IAR tools
	ie: Many 8051 tools.

There is no place to do this sort of stuff in GDB.
