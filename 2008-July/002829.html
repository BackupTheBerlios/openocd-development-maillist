I guess the problem is that that would be another code path to test... The
code is working as intended otherwise.

This would have to be done *everywhere* in the code and at that point I'd
rather place this responsibility with the debugger, which can enable/disable
breakpoints before/after stepping/running.

You could define a few step/breakpoint commands in tcl that has this
functionality. The existing functions would then be the low level implementation
of hardware/software breakpoints.

This isn't a problem when debugging with GDB, is it?

&gt;<i> ---------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another question, about 'working_area'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By default scripts (at least str9comstick.cfg) point at the beginning of
</I>&gt;<i> SRAM.
</I>&gt;<i> For this reason it is not very clear what 'working_area' is (unless you read
</I>&gt;<i> the documentation...) and one can believe (me, for example...) it is the
</I>&gt;<i> beginning of internal SRAM.
</I>&gt;<i> If you load an application into the RAM at the same address (normally at the
</I>&gt;<i> beginning of SRAM) using 'load-image' there is no check of this conflict and
</I>&gt;<i> the load_image algorithm will overwrite itself while running.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Similar problem can happen if you are stepping an application (loaded in
</I>&gt;<i> flash) and you want to load an image (data for debugging purpose) into the
</I>&gt;<i> RAM at a known free address and then resume the application.
</I>&gt;<i> The beginning of the RAM will be overwritten by the algorithm code so some
</I>&gt;<i> variable of your running application is now dirty (registers too?).
</I>&gt;<i> In this case you can use the 'backup' option of 'working_area' command but
</I>&gt;<i> it is not in the default script (should it be?) nor a warning is given to
</I>&gt;<i> the user.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is evident only with 'dcc_downloads' enabled.
</I>
How do you propose to deal with this from a users point of view?
