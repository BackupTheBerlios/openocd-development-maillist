Now this one I really don't understand in terms of what are the benefits of 
changing the syntax of a well established and used command? What was there 
before was simple and easy to follow - and now you have to define two event 
procs to handle it - that does seem like a regression.

Adding in event procs for doing different things to me looks like a good 
approach but changing a command syntax and forcing defining things around this 
way doesn't seem like a good approach.

Pretty much every target script I've come across that isn't in the openocd 
distribution has required work as commands have been changed / renamed - and 
this is something I had hoped had settled down a little but these sorts of 
changes make me thing that things will be moving around for a while longer and 
all scripts will need reworking.

Is there some point in time at which the configuration API will get locked down?

One other scripting use case - assuming that an openocd version number is 
available and that we end up with major.minor.bugfix numbering then scripting 
could be used to have target scripts which work unchanged across multiple 
openocd versions.

Tim.
