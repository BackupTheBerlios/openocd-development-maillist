<PRE>&gt;<i> I agree that scripting does add functionality, but what i also like
</I>&gt;<i> about openocd is that it can be standalone.
</I>
Please define standalone.

OpenOCD needs the executable + some other files it
ships with, but it does not depend on any other modules to be installed.

Is that standalone?

&gt;<i> commands.tcl embedded into openocd binary - i like that idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How about using a similar concept to gcc's specs file, if commands.tcl is
</I>&gt;<i> found in the tcl dir it is used otherwise the internal one is used?
</I>
This sounds like work for no benefit if we have to cross the bridge
that OpenOCD needs the executable + some other files to work
correctly.

&gt;<i> I know a lot of people who use openocd with a single script and the binary
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> production programming, reproducing the dir structure does not suit
</I>&gt;<i> everybody.
</I>
What's the downside to duplicating the entire directory structure?

&gt;<i> embedding commands.tcl would suit everybody would it not?
</I>
I believe that we'll have to cross the bridge that OpenOCD requires
the executable + other files it ships with, sooner rather than
later anyway.

I'd especially like all OpenOCD distributions out there to
ship with the target library to help get the target library
known and get target config files contributed back.

If someone must(why?) minimize the # of files OpenOCD
ships with, they still can.

They can even embed commands.tcl into the single config
file, though this doesn't really strike me as a killer feature.
