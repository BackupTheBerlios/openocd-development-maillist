<PRE>This is work in progress. Development happens on trunk and we'll
have to cut stable branches if need be.

There is a great need to synchronize work because many people are
involved. Both &quot;scripting&quot; people and C people.

Once the dust settles(give it a month or two), the concerns you raised
should be addressed. Some of the concerns are already being adressed.
We're trying to keep  OpenOCD in C and allow for a scripting interface
for higher level fn's.

Some of the code has ended up in the wrong files and is being split
out / moved as things settle down.

The actual amount of code, in the end, will not be very great and
the lower level stuff will have some quirks sorted out, but otherwise
be unchanged.

&gt;<i> - One user told me how things like the target library seemed to be
</I>&gt;<i> over-engineered to him. That's exactly my feeling.
</I>
I'm looking forward to more detailed explanations of such concerns
in this mailing list. The above is too general to comment usefully. Also
a little bit  non sequitor for the scripting topic.

&gt;<i> - Jim is licensed under Apache license V2, which is listed as being
</I>&gt;<i> incompatible with GPLv2 on the FSF page. Large parts of the OpenOCD are
</I>&gt;<i> licensed under the terms of GPLv2 or later.
</I>
jifl on ecos-discuss is looking into this, so it will get sorted
one way or another or we can switch to a different scripting engine.

The eCos guys are pretty paranoid + FSF holds the copyright for
FSF, so this will get *thorough* attention, but it may take some time. :-)

If a single OpenOCD executable would do, then that would be nice, but
we're also looking into ways of allowing the scripting be handled outside
OpenOCD.
