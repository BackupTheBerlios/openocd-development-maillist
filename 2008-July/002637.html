<PRE>Hi &#216;yvind and Pavel,

Some of the e-mails went into the mailing list digest and I did not get them in sequence. Now that I have read all the e-mails in sequence I understand.

A &quot;reset&quot; will be the same as &quot;reset run&quot;. If I want to reset and halt the target, then I have to use &quot;reset run_and_init&quot; explicitly. I agree that this is more intuitive.

Thanks,
Pieter

I'm trying to make commands do predictable and expected things across
configurations.

I don't have to read the fine print in configuration scripts to figure out what
&quot;halt&quot; and &quot;resume&quot; does.

Why should reset be any different?

&gt;<i> Let's take the AT91SAM7S as an example. The only way to halt this target
</I>&gt;<i> and get it into a known &quot;reset&quot; state is to define the configuration as:

Since I'm currently leaning towards &quot;reset run&quot; for the reasons Pavel pointed
out to me, I don't really have many comments on this anymore.

Note that &quot;reset init&quot; is automatically tranlsated to &quot;reset run_and_init&quot; for
the case where srst pulls trst.
