<PRE>Hi List,

unfortunately I don't have nearly enough time to follow all the changes going 
on in the OpenOCD SVN repository, but I'd like to make some comments here:

- Some people have raised concerns about the direction of OpenOCD development. 
The use of TCL for integral parts of the OpenOCD seems unnecessary to me. 
Personally, I don't care about TCL. My language of choice is C. The use of 
TCL and code like

nameObjPtr = Jim_NewStringObj(interp, namebuf, -1);

doesn't look very c-ish...

I would prefer an approach where the TCL interface exposed access to the 
OpenOCD's API (e.g. target_t functions), but limited use of TCL to &quot;comfort&quot; 
functions, like fancy scripts (that's how it started - the desire for better 
scripting).

- One user told me how things like the target library seemed to be 
over-engineered to him. That's exactly my feeling.

- This started out as &quot;some hooks to experiment&quot; and resulted in Jim* being 
introduced in jtag.c to implement the drscan command, in an implementation 
completely different from all other functions in jtag.c.

- I just looked at &quot;openocd.c&quot;, seeing how it grew to three times its size in 
a few weeks. Is this file really the place for functions 
like &quot;Jim_Command_mem2array&quot;? It would be nice if the code could be cleaned 
up a bit once the rate of changes slows down a bit...

- Jim is licensed under Apache license V2, which is listed as being 
incompatible with GPLv2 on the FSF page. Large parts of the OpenOCD are 
licensed under the terms of GPLv2 or later.

Best regards,

Dominic
