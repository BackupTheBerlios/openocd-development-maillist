It shouldn't in TCL. I think Duane is just after name-value pairs. TCL 
arrays are exactly intended for this sort of thing, and are easy to parse. 
Here's an example of array syntax:

% array set foo { name ecosflash  base 1677216  size 2097152  bus_width 2 
  chip_width 2 }
% puts $foo(name)
ecosflash
% puts $foo(base)
1677216
% array get foo
bus_width 2 name ecosflash chip_width 2 size 2097152 base 1677216

I assume Jim TCL has arrays anyway.

Just out of interest, since people were soliciting optinions, my view 
about using TCL in OpenOCD is that it's fine for openocd developers to 
need to know TCL. It's fine for config files to be in a form of TCL, or a 
format parseable by TCL or whatever.

*But* I don't think an openocd *user* should need to know TCL in order to 
use openocd. That's an unfair thing to expect people to have to learn for 
a debugger - yes TCL is simple but that doesn't mean people want to learn 
it and that there isn't a learning curve. And that includes for 
configuring their own target (including adapting existing configurations 
because their own specific target does not exist in the target library, 
most likely because it is a custom board). In other words, the syntax of 
configuring openocd should not require TCL knowledge in itself.

People expect a configuration file to be fairly simple, and people who 
sell commercial JTAG solutions (Ronetix PEEDI, Abatron BDI2/3000 etc.) 
have made their config files straightforward as they know people are more 
interested in configuring the JTAG and getting on with real work, than 
learning language syntax and constructs.
