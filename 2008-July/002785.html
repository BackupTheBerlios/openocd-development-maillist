OpenOCD will go the direction of contributions. If there are contributors
(testing, documentation &amp; code) for a particular direction then OpenOCD
will go in that direction pretty much. Code can get deleted if nobody
tests or maintains it and it is becoming a burden.

That said, there is interest in making OpenOCD much more instruction
set agnostic. Currently there are ARM32 instruction hardcoded into
various drivers and this causes headaches for Cortex that is ARM
thumb only. There has been some thoughts on how to be able to
write target code in C rather than position independent hardcoded
machine code and there are in fact two flash drivers that operate
on this principle.

Also, we already have a MIPS in a branch, that I'm hoping someone
will bring into trunk so we can migrate towards more CPU
independent code.

W.r.t. JTAG on the backend, there is of course a JTAG layer
there today, but if someone contributes a different physical
layer(BDM?), then I don't see why we shouldn't accept that
as well.
