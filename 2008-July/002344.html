<PRE>I realize that I am coming late to this discussion :-( such as the case 
may be.

I too have looked at scripting and openocd.

(A)  Yes, you should implement TCL - period  The issue is &quot;JIM&quot; vrs FULL 
TCL.

JIM-TCL - However - it has its limits.

For a standalone use of openocd. JIM is a great solution because it is 
self contained.

I believe most often - OpenOCD is used with a debugger.

I believe it is utterly important to include the ability to use the full 
Tcl/TK. What you want is TK!

Yes - that makes it harder :-(

(B) Specifically - include an option to use the *FULL* Tcl/Tk package 
that is already provided by &quot;GDB/Insight&quot;

Yea, it is ugly... live with it.

Why? The Tcl/Tk API is stable as all hell. If you want any other GUI - 
you have to find something that transports across Linux, Windows.. (I'm 
80% confident Insight runs on a mac - I don't have one) and you now have 
a multi-platform GUI - that just works and you can script.

How many packages already include Tcl/Tk - via Insight?
   
         ie: MicroCross - &quot;visual debugger&quot; is insight.
         ie: WinAVR - includes &quot;insight&quot;
         WinARM - does not included it - but GDB/Insight runs on Cygwin 
already
        Jim Lynch - in his great &quot;arm development&quot; how to - even 
suggests using Insight instead of the Eclipse internal debugger.

It's already there -- you do not need to do anything special! No 
fighting &quot;wxWidgit&quot; version numbers - and all that sort of stuff... Yea, 
it is ugly - but it works. Remove a level of complexity and ride on the 
coat tails of Insight!!!

For others - Do not think Tcl/Tk is dead language it is the language you 
never hear about.

Numerous commercial chip companies development tools include support Tcl 
-(some also include Tk)
Tcl/Tk - just was not 'sexy'

    &#216;yvind Harboe - already mentioned (FPGA tool) ModelSim
        (ie: The simulation tool free with the Xilinix web pack)
    Analog Devices - VDSP - supports TCL
    The NEC V850 tool chain supports TCL.
    Renesas - includes Tcl/Tk in their IDE
    Code Warrior - includes Tcl/Tk support.

Another case for Tcl/Tk is this: In the development world - one can 
automate other JTAG things - think &quot;expect + openocd&quot; - or 'BSDL' and 
board debug problems with traditional boundary scan.

I'm sure you have seen the Tcl/Tk - demo of the floor plan - you click 
on a room on the map - and something happens.

ie: You see a picture of a chip out line - and you click on it - using 
openocd &amp; boundary scan - and that pin toggles 0/1/0/1...
Tell me how many embedded developers would give their right arm for a 
feature like that.

-Duane.
