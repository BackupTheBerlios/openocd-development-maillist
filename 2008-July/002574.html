Are you saying that LGPL for Jim would be the best alternative? (Ignoring
work involved, someone would have to do that work).

&gt;<i> The only route I can see is to take advantage of the &quot;version 2 or later&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> clause of the existing licence, and move to GPLv3. Because of the &quot;or later&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> bit, you don't need the permission of copyright holders to do that. (But
</I>&gt;<i> once done, you can't go back without permission of copyright holders who

</I>
What happens when one mixes GPL and GPLv3?

I guess the devil is in the details here.

&gt;&gt;<i> Also, we don't need to link Jim Tcl into OpenOCD, but it's less hazzle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The FSF's view (untested in court of course) is that linking does not have
</I>&gt;<i> to mean literal 'ld'. In fact the relevant bit of GPLv2, section 2, does not
</I>&gt;<i> mention linking. It only refers to 'works' in the copyright sense. Having
</I>&gt;<i> them as separate executables, but making one wholly dependent on the other
</I>&gt;<i> means they are not separate 'works' in the copyright sense. If OpenOCD and
</I>&gt;<i> Jim Tcl _were_ separate works which can work together and separately, that
</I>&gt;<i> would be fine. But if Jim is an inherent part of OpenOCD then that does not
</I>&gt;<i> side-step the GPL obligations.
</I>
Another reason to make OpenOCD support multiple scripting engines.

Is there, in practice, a problem to work w/Jim Tcl until we've got the scripting
infrastructure sorted and at that point make a separate executable for
Jim Tcl?

(If we state this as a goal, we'll be getting patches steering us in
that general
direction hopefully).

&gt;&gt;<i> There are many ways forward. Including ditching Jim Tcl.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The scripting work that is being done with Jim Tcl specifically
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> applies to other scripting engines and perhaps we'll define up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an interface to OpenOCD where one can place any engine on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> top.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure. As above, if openocd is not dependent on Jim TCL, that would be fine -
</I>&gt;<i> if Jim just happens to be one of a choice of front-ends (one of which being
</I>&gt;<i> GPL-friendly :-)).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think your easiest route is still GPLv3 though, IMHO.
</I>
That would cause problems for athttpd(eCos license) using Jim Tcl
or?
