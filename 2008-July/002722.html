<PRE>Putting my &quot;user hat&quot; on - I think we sort of went down the wrong path 
with reset.

My reasoning and solution ideas follows.

-Duane.

============

Background:

Openocd is &quot;part of a debugger&quot; - it is not a board or program that runs 
freely.

When something is under the control of a debugger - in some ways, I 
liken &quot;RESET&quot; as &quot;restart&quot; - or &quot;RESET&quot; the mouse trap so I can find the 
bug.
This implies to me - that (1) I can RESET the mouse trap - and (2) when 
i am ready I tell the debugger to RUN or CONTINUE as the case may be.

This sort of implies that the default action in all cases should be:  

    To the best of your ability - RESET and halt at the reset vector.

    Some targets - cannot do that - they do the best they can.
    And can be made to act like that - simple proc.

GDB - on the host side has the same idea - it is sort of like &quot;restart&quot;.

On Linux - this means: Kill and re-initialize the process space back to 
the start condition.

Yes, on linux it also auto-executes the app - why? Because GDB _CAN_ 
initialize the target address space with a linux app.
Since it *CANNOT* always do this with an embedded target - it should 
come damn close.

The issue is the &quot;reset and run&quot;.

===

However, there are some complicating issues:

(A) Some targets you can do exactly that - with no consequences, no 
complications.
    ie: Reset, halt, at the reset vector.
    Or - just simply halt and set the PC at the reset address
    ie: A micro controller fits that example.

Others do not and get more complicated.

(B) Example: When you have an SDRAM present and you are loading the 
program in SDRAM.
    Example: AT91RM9200 - is a nasty beast.
    If I reset the chip I must also:
       Reprogram the Main OSC, Reprogram the PLLs, and re-initalize the 
SDRAM.
       Along the way - one must/can also change the jtag frequency.

In the past, I dealt with (B) by writing macros with the JTAG box I used.

===

Here is my observation and suggestion: I think we need to &quot;divorce&quot; two 
things.

    (a) wiggling the &quot;hard reset signals&quot;
    (b) what the 'reset' command does.

    I think &quot;RESET&quot; today - has become overloaded and complicated.

Step (1)  

    We create a new command - called:   &quot;hard_reset&quot;

    It means *WIGGLE* the pins like pressing a HARD reset button.

    It should have some options. For example:

          hard_reset configure  -type &lt;TYPE&gt;
                   Where TYPE is one of run,halt,init, ... whatever
          hard_reset  cget  
                    [displays current configuration]
          hard_reset 
                    [no options: does what ever is &quot;configured&quot; for all 
targets]
          hard_reset -target 3 -type foo 
                    [performs type foo reset on target 3, does not 
change configuration]

    By default &quot;hard_reset&quot; does this and only this:
           Wiggle JTAG pins and attempt to stop CPU @ reset vector.
           Ready for the debugger to do what they want.

    The HARD reset command performs *NO* actions
    the HARD reset command has no &quot;scripts&quot; no nothing.

STEP 2

    Delete the existing &quot;reset&quot; command - and replace it with
    a new &quot;reset&quot; command that does this:

                &quot;hard_reset&quot; with no options.

    To change the configuration of &quot;reset&quot; you do this:

            reset configure -command   &quot;SOME STRING&quot;

    To see the current configuration, use the standard &quot;tcl&quot; option &quot;cget&quot;.

            reset cget -command

    Where:   SOMESTRING defines what RESET does.
          the default being:   &quot;hard_reset&quot;.
     
    You can easily reconfigure &quot;reset&quot; like this:

   Option (A) - The default is really this:

          reset configure -action hard_reset

    Option (B) [read commands from a file]

            reset   configure -command  &quot;source my_reset_file.txt&quot;

    Option (C) Execute a TCL function.

          proc  my_reset_function { }  {
                ... pre-wiggle commands

                 # Wiggle the pins
                  hard_reset --target 0

                ... post-wiggle commands
           }

          reset configure -action  my_reset_function
    or   reset configure -action  &quot;my_reset_function  Param1 Parm2&quot;

================

   Options (B) and (C) address SPEN's issue:
  
        &gt;&gt; Rather I'm thinking that a reset
        &gt;&gt; procedure needs to be written
        &gt;&gt; in script form to handle the
        &gt;&gt; more contrived cases.

========================

    This would also remove *ALL* of these &quot;pre/post&quot; reset things.
    And all this &quot;target_N_stuf&quot;

    I think this &quot;pre/post&quot; and event proc stuff is confusing the issue 
to no end.
    This is also some of what Tim Hudson is complaining about.

========================
 
    I think this would also help address Tim Hudson's concern:

       &gt; What was there before was simple and easy to
       &gt; follow - and now you have to define two event
       &gt; procs to handle it - that does seem like a regression.

    Why? Those event procs are gone.
    And you can define &quot;reset&quot; to do what you want by
    putting the commands you want _IN_ the script file
    or in the TCL Proc - your choice.

========================
 
This answers Oyvinds concern:

    &gt;&gt;- added hardcoded reset modes from gdb_server.c.
    &gt;&gt; I don't know precisely what these defaults should be
     &gt;&gt; or if it should be made configurable. Perhaps some
    &gt;&gt; hardcoded defaults will do for now and it can be
    &gt;&gt; made configurable later.

MAYBE - we define a new new command, that by default is this:

      proc gdb_reset  {  }    { reset }

A RESET request from GDB (not &quot;mon reset&quot;) executes: &quot;gdb_reset&quot;

By default - it ends up executing &quot;reset&quot; - however:

Thus, if the user needs to &quot;monkey&quot; with RESET because of GDB... the 
user can.
For example - it could reset the board and reconfigure the SDRAM ...
In the *SAME* simple 3 ways described above.

========================
