<PRE>&gt;<i> If one element is added - in the wrong place - or - something is moved -
</I>&gt;<i> BOOM - nothing works. A classic &quot;off-by-one&quot; bug.
</I>
When we decide that flash_banks is an official API, it's output can
*NEVER* change.

If you want a different output, you have to define a new command(or
arguments to the old one, which would be backwards compatible).

I'm not too keen on &quot;flexible&quot; results. They cause complexity in the
client. There must be some tangible shortterm benefit to this.

&gt;<i> It is a C99 style reply that I strongly advocate
</I>
This adds a lot of work to the client code and I don't see the
benefit.

We *could* use XML, but I'd rather not make that the API. Shudder!

&gt;<i> Some believe it is overly complicated, perhaps they do not see what I see.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> =========================================
</I>&gt;<i> Problem Example:
</I>&gt;<i> =========================================
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Today - we have exactly 1 command - the one &#216;yvind wrote, and it has an
</I>&gt;<i> *exact* example of the problem that i do not want to see happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can somebody fix this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     In the &quot;flash_banks&quot; the field num_sectors field is missing.
</I>
It is implied by ordering.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How can this be fixed?
</I>
Once flash_banks is carved in stone, we'd have to define a new command,
the old one is carved in stone.

This is no big deal. It's a bit of added code either way, no difference in
coding quantity on client or host really.

the problem with flash_banks is that it exposes *too much* information
rather than too little.

I was thinking about another form(API design has not yet started,
we're still trying to figure out hte form it should take):

flash_banks address =&gt; address

Don't mind the precise form above. The idea is that the information
you are looking for is passed in as an argument. This is perhaps
somewhat more along the lines you were looking for.

&gt;<i> Please do not break any host side application that coded to the exactly 5
</I>&gt;<i> item response
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And - do not change the parameter order - many other apps hard code that
</I>&gt;<i> specific order.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Remember: Tomorrow will happen again - if not this command the next command
</I>&gt;<i> will have this problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This problem is worse with the &quot;flash info&quot; command.
</I>
flash info is a contrived example: it can never expose enough information
to let a user do whatever he wants. Ultimately driver code is required.

We need to define *narrow* and *stable* APIs rather than numerous
and complicated.

&gt;<i> Look carefully at how the HTTP protocol is implemented - and how flexible it
</I>&gt;<i> has been.
</I>
I guess I want something that is easier to implement than HTTP as my
ambitions are not quite that high in terms of reach :-)

Also we have *MUCH* lower latency, so we can use roundtrips to a greater
extent.

I don't want XML either, for all it's benefits.

There is such a thing as overkill.

Look at HTTP server/client *implementations* they are *NOT* simple.

I certainly don't want to implement something that *looks* like XML/HTTP,
but isn't.

&gt;<i> =========================================
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I described in earlier email, the *WIRE*LINE* protocol request should be
</I>&gt;<i> simple - like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     tcl:      flash_banks
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;blankline&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The response is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     status:   error
</I>&gt;<i>     human:   Some Human Error Message
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;blank line&gt;
</I>
Can you show two pieces of client code that compares
the complexity of parsing tcl responses vs. the above?

For tcl return format, there is no difference between code
running on the client or running inside openocd(pretty much).

&gt;<i> The trick here is create an example - in many script languages with a
</I>&gt;<i> *PROPER* parser
</I>&gt;<i> that properly adheres to the rules we want to create. Like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     random order of name &amp; values
</I>&gt;<i>     How to ignore things that are unknown.
</I>&gt;<i>     How to handle very long lines.
</I>&gt;<i>     How to handle the &quot;data phase&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>     Blank Line Ends.
</I>
You just convinced me that this is pretty nasty stuff to parse.

&gt;<i> =========================================
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Getting this API right - now - will have great benefit later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is a *GREAT* google tech talks video  @ google video about API
</I>&gt;<i> design by Joshua Bloch
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     <A HREF="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3733345136856180693">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3733345136856180693</A>
</I>
I flipped through it. Many good points there.
