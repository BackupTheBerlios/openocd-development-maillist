I didn't think you were able to change the licence of Jim or OpenOCD, as 
you would need the permission of all copyright holders.

The only route I can see is to take advantage of the &quot;version 2 or later&quot; 
clause of the existing licence, and move to GPLv3. Because of the &quot;or 
later&quot; bit, you don't need the permission of copyright holders to do that. 
(But once done, you can't go back without permission of copyright holders 
who contributed code when it's under GPLv3).

&gt;<i> Also, we don't need to link Jim Tcl into OpenOCD, but it's less hazzle.
</I>
The FSF's view (untested in court of course) is that linking does not have 
to mean literal 'ld'. In fact the relevant bit of GPLv2, section 2, does 
not mention linking. It only refers to 'works' in the copyright sense. 
Having them as separate executables, but making one wholly dependent on 
the other means they are not separate 'works' in the copyright sense. If 
OpenOCD and Jim Tcl _were_ separate works which can work together and 
separately, that would be fine. But if Jim is an inherent part of OpenOCD 
then that does not side-step the GPL obligations.

&gt;<i> There are many ways forward. Including ditching Jim Tcl.
</I>
Obviously.

&gt;<i> The scripting work that is being done with Jim Tcl specifically
</I>&gt;<i> applies to other scripting engines and perhaps we'll define up
</I>&gt;<i> an interface to OpenOCD where one can place any engine on
</I>&gt;<i> top.
</I>
Sure. As above, if openocd is not dependent on Jim TCL, that would be fine 
- if Jim just happens to be one of a choice of front-ends (one of which 
being GPL-friendly :-)).

I think your easiest route is still GPLv3 though, IMHO.
