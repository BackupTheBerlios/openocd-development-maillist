Heh, world domination is of course the ultimate goal... the limitation to ARM 
comes from ARM being easily available, relatively simple, supported by rich 
documentation, etc.

PowerPC for example would be great, but the devices are a lot more expensive, 
and documentation is impossible to get.

It would be great if we could get support for other processors as well.

Regards,

Dominic
