But would they then be sent in the same communication channel? Because
that would then break the beautifully simple architecture; one remote
call results in one response.

I am sorry for pestering you on this. I am just trying to figure out how
to write a decent HMI for the thing. The HMI should at all times be
aware of what is happening with a minimal (from the human point of view)
delay.

But let's see... If we want to keep out of any asynchronous
communication, then:

1. There must be no errors independent of user actions. That is, the
system will not poll anything in the background in script use. Or if it
polls, the poll results have to be available through some command. By
default, if something goes wrong, it is noted by an exception thrown
when executing the next relevant command.

2. All commands must be completed in a short time (with the notable
exception of sleep), but this can be handled at the client script. At
the moment it seems that large read/write commands may not fulfill this
requirement (are there others?). If so, that can be solved by writing a
suitable chunk at a time. This should not be terribly uneconomic if the
DCC transfers are split into three (initialize, transfer block,
finalize) to avoid unnecessary repetitions. (A rough calculation says
that once-per-second is a decent update pace. If this requires an extra
packet pair exchange, it is not a problem at any scale.)


The DCC in other than transfer use is a bit of a problem. Maybe a
buffered poll function is required? On the other hand, there is no
guarantee of catching all transient DCCR values at the moment, either.
