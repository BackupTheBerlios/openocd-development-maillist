<PRE>Short version is this:

You *MUST* be able to change the JTAG clock frequency - *at*least* by 
hand.... to any value - at any time using a command.

The Long version - with explanation follows

Pieter&gt; The AT91SAM9260's JTAG speed must always be 6 times lower than 
its clock speed.

The true problem is - many jtag controllers do not support RTCK - or the 
chip implementor choose not to hook the F-ing pin up. the pin is 
*REQUIRED* on many &quot;S&quot; type cores from ARM - but ... well not always 
there. Chip companies sometimes skimp. Board makers do not understand  
and skimp.

It is called &quot;adaptive clocking&quot; see this:

<A HREF="http://www.arm.com/support/faqdev/4170.html">http://www.arm.com/support/faqdev/4170.html</A>

Example - ARM7TDMI-S - found in a number of chips.
See: <A HREF="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0234b/DDI0234.pdf">http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0234b/DDI0234.pdf</A>
Page 5-10 &amp; 5-11, Section 5.3.5

FYI - there are two types of arm7tdmi - &quot;hard macro cell&quot; - or 
&quot;synthesize-able aka: S core&quot;.
The S type, has 2 rules:  6x slower - or use RTCK. The hard macro cell - 
I think is 6x slower.

Example: ARM966 - (aka: STR9 parts)
<A HREF="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0213e/ARM966E-S_TRM.pdf">http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0213e/ARM966E-S_TRM.pdf</A>
Pages 7-1 - section 7.1.2

Example: ARM946
<A HREF="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0201d/DDI0201D_arm946es_r1p1_trm.pdf">http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0201d/DDI0201D_arm946es_r1p1_trm.pdf</A>
Pages 9-3, section 9.1.3

I am surprised to find the 926ej-s TRM does not state anything about the 
RTCK signal. Nor does the ARM968.  However - reading that part of the 
TRMs signal description I suspect they require it - but perhaps did not 
document it as clearly as they should have (they probably do - in 'nda' 
type documents)

While Pieter says 6x slower - ST says 10x slower - (STR9 data sheet 
section 3.15, 3rd paragraph
Perhaps ST does something more we do not know about.
<A HREF="http://www.st.com/stonline/products/literature/ds/13495.pdf">http://www.st.com/stonline/products/literature/ds/13495.pdf</A>

There are others - like XILINX who want 12x slower, 32/12 =&gt; 1.x khz - I 
can probably only program even multiples so it is 1khz clock YUCK!

PIETER&gt;   Let's say one was busy with a debugging session where the 
AT91SAM9260's clock speed was 100 MHz and the JTAG Speed set to 6 MHz.

I'll give you a worse situation - battery powered system, CPU runs @ 100 
mhz, update the LCD, set LCD &amp; SDRAM to self refresh, turn off all 
clocks and run on the 32khz clock.
and wait for the user to press a button. Or maybe &quot;hibernate&quot; or &quot;off&quot; 
mode - So - the CPU dynamically switches between 32khz - and 100mhz - 
lighting fast.

So for normal debugging I am going to run at 5khz Jtag? Oh please!!!!!! 
SHOOT ME NOW! This is very true if you are debugging ultra low power and 
&quot;wakeup after sleep&quot; or &quot;hibernate&quot; problems.

I have done that before - what a pain in the ass!.

You *MUST* be able to change the JTAG clock frequency - *at*least* by 
hand.... to any value - at any time.

Or - the JTAG interface *MUST* support RTCK - in a reasonable way. (I 
know a commercial JTAG box - that had mental issues - with ultra slow 
jtag clocks)

I sure wish FTDI - would have supported RTCK... what a loss.

I suspect - (because the Cortex debug TRM debug manual states: &quot;Arm 
Limited recommends that RTCK is not implemented on an arm debug 
interface&quot;) it will never happen on cortex.

Perhaps - there is something new - about cortex - I do not know.

-Duane.
