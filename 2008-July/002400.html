<PRE>&#216;yvind&gt; Once there are some polymorph proc's defined, I'd like to update 
the Zylin
&#216;yvind&gt; Embedded CDT to support them. This will allow showing and even 
modifying
&#216;yvind&gt; peripherals from a GDB GUI frontend.

duane&gt; This should use the interface Charles is creating.

&#216;yvind&gt; I don't want to set up anything else but the GDB connection, 
more hazzle
&#216;yvind&gt; for the user, so I'd like to do any communication using the GDB
&#216;yvind&gt; monitor command.

&#216;yvind&gt;  Would that be a problem?

Yes, and no.

First - the &quot;MON&quot; command is the same as TELNET - you just do not have 
to prefix your commands with mon.  Basically what I proposed in my 
earlier email in response to Charles - is a programmatic machine 
interface to the &quot;telnet prompt&quot; that simplifies parsing.

Second, the telnet interface is great for a human but it is not a 
programmatic machine interface. You cannot tell success, and you cannot 
tell failure. You must parse english prose - if you get any. yes, that 
does work - but it is painful and complicated to write for.

Third - nothing gets rid of the &quot;mon&quot; type interface. Or the telnet 
inter face. But - they both suffer from a &quot;connection state&quot;. See below.

NO - because - if GDB is the remote agent talking to OPENOCD - then GDB 
can do what ever it feels like.

YES - because GDB is active - an external program cannot access memory 
to do something like &quot;display memory as a jpeg&quot;. For example - what if I 
am using DDD - w/ gdb-arm remote? or KDBUG - I certianly cannot get 
these features added there. Or - if I am using IAR (Like Simon Qian is 
using) there would be no way for an external tool to access memory.

About the &quot;connection state problem&quot; yes - I could &quot;disconnect GDB&quot; - 
run my tool - but - when I reconnect GDB - GDB wants to re-download my 
app. I loose my debug state. If On the other hand we apply the *simple* 
rule - The human (doing the debugging) must enforce some amount of 
exclusive access.  ie: If I stop GDB, something else can display memory. 
GDB does not need to know.  We could improve that a great deal - with 
the programatic interface - by returning a defined &quot;BUSY&quot; error if the 
target is busy (ie: running under GDB control)

In addition, the &quot;programmatic interface&quot; effectively holds no state. A 
program while connected - holds an exclusive lock. That &quot;image display 
program&quot; can and should disconnect and reconnect at will.

-Duane.
