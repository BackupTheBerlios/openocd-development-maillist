I am a developer in a number of (minor patches in most, core developer
in one) Open Source projects (mostly GPLv2) and a developer on a ARM
related project.

I have not even looked at the OpenOCD code yet...

The version of OpenOCD I have does not work for me 100% but I have not
looked at the source yet... I was going to but the windows build
complexity has deterred me from attempting it.

My position is that GPL is the best license to use for most group
projects of this nature (ad hoc developers, etc)
 
My opinion in this is there is no way to control what has been released
in the past and the future releases should adhere to the license.

If this means some limitations then that is acceptable, since the
community will implement features to remove those limitations.

That is a very nature of open source... when a bug pisses me off enough
I take time to find and/or fix it.

It seems while this list is called openocd-development it may have more
users than developers. That is my observation... besides we all were
users before we became developers!

Tom
