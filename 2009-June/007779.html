<PRE>duane&gt; $TARGETNAME mdw

david&gt; Though &quot;mdw&quot; is really impractical for scripting.

yea, it's probably a very bad example, one probably needs to use 
'$targetname mem2array&quot; or &quot;$targetname array2mem&quot;, or we can create a 
helper sub-command

david&gt;  A third option: too painful to use. How exactly is $_TARGETNAME
david&gt;  going to get *into* the event handler since nothing binds the right
david&gt;  value to that name??

david&gt; I'll tell you how. By hard-wiring a particular target name.

I presume you mean the $_TARGETNAME  will not be valid when the event is 
invoked. TK  handles events with things like %w for the window path, 
treating the event handler body sort of like an &quot;sprintf()&quot; format 
string.  Sadly, JIM is not that complicated, I thought about adding a %T 
for the current target name. That would be a good future enhancement.

But - today I think what you mean is this:

Today, all target reset handlers are done like this:  
    $_targetname  configure -event reset-init  { CURLYBRACE }

TCL variable parsing rules mean that things in { CURLYBRACE } are not 
not expanded right now.

The *could* be done like this:  
    $_targetname  configure -event reset-init  &quot;double-quoted-string&quot;

In the double-quoted case, the &quot;double-quoted&quot; method would cause the 
embeded $_TARGETNAME to be expanded prior to invoking the &quot;configure&quot; 
sub command.

david&gt;  Some of that's a general event handler issue: the event handlers 
have no invocation-specific context.

There is no doubt in my mind there are giant dragons we do not know about.

david&gt;  [snip] But &quot;reset halt&quot;means I get a bare CPU, in need of 
serious re-init, and using a slow JTAG clock...)

Good example of that is a complex multi-target board.  However, that 
senario presents an N-way way combination that we cannot today make 
reusable code for. We can, however document each thing seperately - so 
that the user/victim can figure out how to weave the two reset processes 
they need together.

-Duane.
