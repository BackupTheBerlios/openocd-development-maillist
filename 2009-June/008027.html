However, considering that the oldest version of OpenOCD as published by 
Dominic Rath, the initial author, did contain support for ftd2xx 
already, it would be hard to dispute the fact that this wasn't the 
initial author's intention to allow this usage.  And subsequent 
contributors didn't complain about this either, so they could be 
considered to have agreed implicitly to that exception as well.  And 
given the visibility and importance of the ftd2xx library usage (it was 
listed in the documentation from the beginning, etc.) then those 
contributors won't be able to claim in good faith that they didn't know 
about the existence of that lib and its nature and retroactively revoke 
their consent after all that time (in practice they actually might not 
have noticed nor considered the issue and if they had known it then 
might not have agreed to the situation but that's not easily 
defendable).

So, I don't think it is clear at all given those facts if distribution 
of OpenOCD that can use the libftd2xx, which on Windows is installed 
from a separate package, is actually illegal or not.  The situation is 
probably just as gray and disputable as proprietary modules on Linux: 
their usage is tolerated while their legality remains uncertain and is 
likely to remain so for quite a while.
