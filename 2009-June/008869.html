</I>
I would also suggest using libltdl for these tasks; however, that should
be a fairly easy change, after eliminating the existing redundancy.

After thinking about this patch some more today, I have become confused
about its motives.  If the binary cannot be distributed with the FTD2XX
driver in it, this patch does not help folks that must compile the code
themselves anyway.  You cannot have both libftdi and FTD2XX support in
the same FT2232 driver binary, so this patch not even allowing testing
them both using the same openocd binary (presumably by adding/removing
the OS drivers between tests).  

The later suggestion shows that there could be some value of allowing
dynamic loading like this, if you provided a second patch to fix the
build system to produce both drivers.  However, I think that such a
patch will only be possible after adding more full dynamic loading for
the JTAG interface drivers.  Specifically, the proper place to use
dynamic module loading will be to discover the jtag_interface structure
from each OpenOCD driver module, adding the structure from each
successfully loaded module to populate the interface list.   With that,
you no longer need this patch either, because the module will fail to
load if its required libraries are missing.

Personally, I think that I have failed to see the value of this patch,
but maybe I have missed something.  In contrast to the strategic
solution, what problems does this current patch solve for OpenOCD users,
today?  Without a clear answer to this, I am not sure why we want it.

Cheers,

Zach
