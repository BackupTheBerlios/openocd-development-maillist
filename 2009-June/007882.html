That would be &quot;very strong&quot;.  &quot;strong&quot; just means that a variable has  
a designated type associated with it.  &quot;weak&quot; on the other hand is  
like JavaScript where a variable has no type information attached to it.

&gt;<i> C makes that trivial:  cast to/from &quot;void *&quot;

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
&quot;strong&quot; typing has nothing to do with hiding machine-specific  
details.  It's all about a variable being designated to hold a  
specific type of data rather than an arbitrary type.  Now, void * in C  
lets you cast between types that would otherwise cause errors.  That  
doesn't make it &quot;weak&quot;, just not as &quot;strong&quot;.

&gt;<i> It is however worth pointing out that there are dozens of definitions
</I>&gt;<i> of what &quot;strong typing&quot; is ... although this is the first time I've  
</I>&gt;<i> ever
</I>&gt;<i> heard anyone apply that term to C.  (Since I first found a looseleaf

</I>&gt;<i> weren't
</I>&gt;<i> very available!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I've commonly heard C and C++ referred to as strongly-typed.  The fact  
that you can't declare a variable without a type is an indication of  
this.  void * let's you work around some undesirable effects of strong- 
typing, but it is a type itself.

&gt;<i> C++ adds a few type frameworks to C, yes, but still doesn't have  
</I>&gt;<i> what I'd
</I>&gt;<i> call &quot;strong&quot; typing.  (Plus, all its dynamic/reinterpret/static/const
</I>&gt;<i> cast mechanisms get confusing.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I agree the multitude of options for casting are confusing in C++, but  
those actually point to the fact that C++ is strongly typed by  
default.  The reason that dynamic_cast exists is that C++ assumes that  
references to variables are to a specific type (static typing) and  
will normally write code to access it directly as such.  dynamic_cast  
tells C++ to instead evaluate the type at runtime (dynamic typing) so  
the underlying type can be changed without recompiling the calling code.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 	 but proper use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of an abstract type can greatly simplify the implementation as the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> efforts to simplify the target APIs has shown. We are already  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> adopting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> most of the encapsulation paradigm for targets and ADTs build on  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Encapsulation != strong typing (and vice versa!).
</I>
I never said it was.  Encapsulation can easily be done in any language  
regardless of strong vs weak.  ADTs on the other hand build on top of  
encapsulation and dynamic runtime type information.  They utilize  
encapsulation to hide the internal details of the object so that those  
internals can be changed by subclasses.  Further, by using dynamic  
typing, the subclasses can be passed a reference to the ADT and  
convert it into their subclass so they can do special things to it.

&gt;<i> And I still stand
</I>&gt;<i> by my observation that I've usually seen *team* approaches to strong
</I>&gt;<i> typing fail, when they need to be built with weakly typed languages.
</I>&gt;<i> The dynamics rarely support it as the code base evolves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm not a huge fan of &quot;very strong&quot; for typing nor of static typing.   
They purport to improve the stability of the code by always knowing  
what can be done with an object but it makes for a lot of nasty code  
though since non-trivial programs often need some of the features of  
weak-typing along with dynamic typing.  I'm actually quite fond of  
Objective-C which is strongly-typed and very dynamic.  Further,  
everything is allocated on the heap and passed by pointer.  So objects  
can be cast to a generic type that means &quot;some type of class&quot; and then  
have the type information recovered by asking the object.

&gt;<i> However, I'm all in favor of evolving code to respect clearly defined
</I>&gt;<i> data types, which encapsulate roles and responsibilities to support
</I>&gt;<i> better system structures.  If there's a better way to do it, I've not
</I>&gt;<i> yet come across that answer.  :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That's really all I'm recommending.  I've seen a dynamic- and strongly- 
typed language do very well for doing encapsulation and using ADTs to  
make a very clean system architecture that allows for lots of future  
extensions.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think that a well thought out implementation of an abstract target
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> type and interface will do wonders to the code base and maintenance.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Using encapsulation will make this even better for future expansion
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and enhancement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All that's true, but it's still very different from &quot;strong typing&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> (using any definition I've worked with).
