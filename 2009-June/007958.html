That's a fine question, and is exactly what I meant by (b).

I don't have a good answer, but note that [patch 2/3] has
the same requirement to access things that the target code
is keeping excessively close.  The &quot;layer&quot; boundaries are
clearly not quite right.

For 0.2.0 I suggest not worrying about this; layering is
there to help structure things, not to prevent solutions.
The scope is very limited.

The flag used in [patch 1/3] might better be modeled as a
global mutex gating ownership to the JTAG stack ... but
that concept isn't there in the code.  The target stack
could just stick to a private flags.

Maybe the stuff in [patch 2/3] would better be modeled
as JTAG events delivered to that TAP.  Target code would
just listen for TAP enable events.
