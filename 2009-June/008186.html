<PRE>Hi all,

For my next trick with my Surpass tool, I intend to try and bring more
uniformity to the various OpenOCD APIs.  This primarily translates to
renaming functions such that they group and sort better, but it should
also involve structure and enum names.  We could even go so far replace
instances of 'struct blah *' and 'blah_t *' with new 'blah_p' types.

These kinds of transformations can be turned into a new chain of patch
series, by providing a list of simple search and replace expressions.
Examples of these expressions are provided in the commit comments of my
recent series of patches, though most of those are probably more complex
than what will be needed for this type of simple symbol rework.

Please reply to this thread with suggestions for symbols changes that
can be accomplished in this manner.  Specifically, please provide lines
of text that meet following the criteria:

0) Two columns of text, separated by a TAB character:
1) Column 1: regex suitable for grep and LHS of &quot;sed -e 's,LHS,RHS,g'&quot;
2) Column 2: pattern suitable for RHS of &quot;sed -e 's,LHS,RHS,g'&quot;

For example, I have the following symbols on my hit list already, which
should come through in this required format (attach it, if in doubt):

jtag_register_event_callback	jtag_event_callback_register
jtag_unregister_event_callback	jtag_event_callback_unregister
jtag_call_event_callback	jtag_event_callbacks_run

These changes reflect a very simple heuristic: name components should be
ordered from the most general to most specific.  The following naming
schemes should demonstrate this model with more clarity:

  module_noun_verb
  module_primary_secondary_verb
  module_primary_secondary_phase_step
  module_structure_field_verb

With this scheme, related symbols will be grouped properly when sorted
in the documentation.  By extension, this will help developers learning
the code, because names will become easily derivable from related
constructs.

I can provide numerous other examples in the code where this general
guideline could be followed, but I can also find places where it would
be idiosyncratic when applied.  Put another way, this rule does not
suffice on its own, but I think it worth giving some consideration
before the 0.2.0 release.

While each function merits independent consideration for its name, this
heuristic provides a unified style with some clear benefits, but other
schemes would work.  We need to have agreed upon these high-level
standards before the repository sees any renaming changes committed, and
I this will emerge from the suggestions provided under this thread.

I hope the community contributes ideas, so I can collate the feedback
into appropriate series scripts.  This may be a Sisyphean task overall,
but the low-hanging fruit are overripe and must be picked to avoid rot.

Cheers,

Zach
