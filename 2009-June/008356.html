Congratulations!  You have suggested another potentially legal mechanism
for distributing a FTD2XX binary driver.

However -- for this to be legitimate -- you would need to implement a
fully generic &quot;socket-based JTAG interface&quot; driver... which is what has
been previously discussed on this list as the TCP/IP driver.  With such
a generic mechanism, one could build and distribute a completely and
totally separate binary that contains the FTD2XX driver.

It would _not_ be legal to define a FTD2XX-only socket interface,
because that would be deferring the link step to the socket open call!!
It must be a generic interface.  This interpretation derives from past
experience with other projects, though I cannot recall exactly from
where this particular bit of wisdom derives.

More importantly, any driver-side code for this socket-based interface
would need to be licensed under the LGPL, or the present situation will
remain unchanged.  

Clearly, this will not be possible for 0.2.0, but the build-kit idea
would be a temporary workaround.  Furthermore, both will improve the
functional capabilities of OpenOCD for users, so it is by far the best
solution in terms of delivering tangible value to the community.

Cheers,

Zach
