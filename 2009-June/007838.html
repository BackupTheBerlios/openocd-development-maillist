</I>&gt;<i> 2. I ran into problems with Makefile.am and configure.in not having

</I>&gt;<i> deleting &quot;ltmain.sh&quot; and various other files.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I did some tests and it seemed that the problem &quot;make maintainer-clean&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> problem was due to the svn native option and Cygwin getting confused.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Great! I thought, I know how to fix that!&quot; So I committed a fix to remove
</I>&gt;<i> svn eol line endings for Makefile.am and configure.in.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Only it didn't fix the problem w/&quot;make maintainer-clean&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So now I have a situation in Cygwin w/Eclipse/Windows svn client
</I>&gt;<i> where:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - I don't know understand why ltmain.sh isn't removed during &quot;make
</I>&gt;<i> maintainer-clean&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> - I saw &quot;ltmain.sh&quot; being removed by &quot;make maintainer-clean&quot; but I
</I>&gt;<i> don't know what I did to make that happen and I can't reproduce
</I>&gt;<i> this behaviour under Cygwin.
</I>&gt;<i> - Makefile.am and configure.in no longer has the svn native line endings
</I>&gt;<i> under in svn head.
</I>&gt;<i> - There is clear evidence that it is *wrong* to use svn eol native for
</I>&gt;<i> .sh files but it is unclear what to do with other files that Cygwin
</I>&gt;<i> reads...

I particularly like the postscript. :)  We are not alone here.
