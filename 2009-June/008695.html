</I>&gt;<i> But even if it wasn't so, only the translation layer between Linux API

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, I have mentioned that modular drivers could allow a build-kit

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be perfect for this though!  Modular drivers are still a Good Thing.

</I>&gt;<i> distribute FTD2XX ourselves, but point users to the FTDI download page
</I>&gt;<i> and say &quot;if you download the DLL and put it in the OpenOCD directory,
</I>&gt;<i> something magic could happen&quot;. I'm assuming here it's not legal to
</I>&gt;<i> distribute FTD2xx, I don't know about that as I don't know what license
</I>&gt;<i> it's available under.
</I>&gt;<i> It's all gray here, but won't somebody please think of the chil^H^H^H^H

Arg.  The link kit suffers from the same deficiencies: what are
distributed inside the ccache?  The _binary_ object files.  Mega-Duh.
In hindsight, this particular solution is just &quot;unlinked binary&quot;
distribution; it should be considered DOA.  I probably missed that
because I'm going on 26+ hours since sleeping.  Sorry.

&gt;<i> As you might have noticed I'm one of the &quot;loose&quot; people regarding this
</I>&gt;<i> GPL thing, but on the other hand I'm not too keen on binary modular
</I>&gt;<i> drivers. At least the translation layer should be GPL'd and the binary
</I>&gt;<i> part should be publicly available. This opens a lot of doors, but maybe
</I>&gt;<i> some we don't want to open...
</I>
Someone should present a complete design document. ;)

Cheers,

Zach
