</I>&gt;<i> The MS-WinUSB driver - did not  *ship* with WinXP, but is available as a

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I understand (I have not confirmed, and I do not know all the details

</I>&gt;<i> the GPL.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This solution is - by design - something that can be added to WinXP (the 
</I>&gt;<i> co-install solution).  I think of it sort of like this: &quot;The old system 
</I>&gt;<i> only supplied a CDROM (read-only) driver&quot; - later - new systems come 
</I>&gt;<i> with CD-WRITER (and today, we have CD-RW) - the *new* os does not 
</I>&gt;<i> require an upgrade, the *old* os has an upgrade path to make the 
</I>&gt;<i> CD-WRITER (and now CD-RW) work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I should - as a user of that old system - install the OS update - and be 
</I>&gt;<i> able to make use of that GPL software.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All is not rosy and perfect, &quot;WinUSB&quot; would require an INF file that 
</I>&gt;<i> *points* to the driver - much like the work that Freddy is working

This is a VERY interesting suggestion.

WunUSB *is* a system library, as it comes from the OS vendor and
provides general services for many devices, not just one subset of
devices. It is a General USB interface.

This should also have the advantage of being signed by microsoft so it
will install on all (current) versions of the windows operating systems.

The question I have is...

If we have an INF file pointing to a signed driver, does the INF/Driver
pair need to be signed, or is the signing just the authenticate the
driver CODE as being trusted?

If it is just the driver code, then I think this is the most stable long
term solution above all.

Now assuming libftdi interfaces to a USB library that could mean that
the 32/64 bit issues can be handled in winusb, since USB is just a frame
based communications pipe (byte stream)
