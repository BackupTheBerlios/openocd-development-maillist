This is an excellent point regarding the invalidity of &quot;I actually meant
for the license to X&quot;.  Would everyone be so keen to accept this if it
were put into terms where X was &quot;take freedoms from all of you chumps?&quot;
Coincidentally, that is exactly how I interpret the attempt to relicense
the changes to allow an exception for proprietary linkage.

At this point, there do not appear to exist any reasonable basis for
arguing against this fact: the GPL was always the license for OpenOCD.
Arguments to dispute this fact need to provide convincing evidence, and
I think the repository justifies our position here -- not an exception.

Cheers,

Zach
