<PRE>Hello to all,

I don't want to get involved in the 'war' that seems to have erupted over 
this issue.
I am a user of OpenOCD rather than a developer, I regularly grab SVN head 
and compile it under Cygwin for Windows with FTD2XX.lib. And I will continue 
to do so for my private build.

It is clear that OpenOCD is GPL.
It is also clear that FTD2XX.lib is not, although no license is published, 
the source code is also not published - it cannot be GPL.

Am I correct in thinking that the 'driver' forms part of the operating 
system?
And that the library is the non-GPL part that is the problem?

If that is the case, the simple solution is to develop a GPL version of the 
library, but continue to use the driver.
As Xiofan Chen pointed out, there is already an incomplete project at 
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ftd2xx">http://sourceforge.net/projects/ftd2xx</A>

IMHO the libusb-libftdi is a massive overkill that causes other problems for 
Windows users. Mainly because it is trying to replace the driver, not just 
the problematic library.
My own problems with libusb-libftdi are:
1. I have 6 devices that are regularly used with my PC that use one form or 
another FTDI device. Because these are of varying ages, the drivers versions 
are different, they must be installed in a correct order or some of the 
devices fail. Why is this a problem?, because running FT_Clean in order to 
install libusb-libftdi will remove all of these drivers as well.
2. I have two other programs that make use of my JtagKey, replacing the 
driver with libusb-libftdi will break these programs.


I may be wrong with one or more of my assumptions, if I am then please 
politely point this out, as I said at the start - I do not want propogate 
this war of words.
My intention of replacing FTD2XX.lib with a GPL version is NOT an attempt to 
circumvent the GPL, such as the wrapper methods that have been suggested. I 
believe that if a GPL library was available, using the existing driver would 
not be a GPL violation, and the whole solution would be a cleaner more 
palatable solution for all.

I kind of don't need to say this next bit ........ but what are your 
thoughts ;-)

BR,
Ian.
