You forgot something [; I don't need to pay for anything, nor does 
anyone else. I can build my own executable with ftd2xx. If you will drop 
that support, I'll just stay with the most recent one that has it. 
Others can do whatever they want - use free versions of commercial 
software, use cracked versions of commercial software, reinstall the 
system (via some ghost-copy mechanism it takes less than 15minutes) 
every month when the free CrossWorks license ends... So sorry, no money 
from me. Your idea behind open-source is very noble indeed.

&gt;<i> You are spreading FUD.   Please.  Stop.  Now.
</I>
Why? You - on the other hand - are all &quot;that violates GPL, period&quot;, so 
you're spreading &quot;GPL-or-die&quot;. Please. Stop. Now. Any realistic solution 
is &quot;violating the GPL&quot; according to you, that's a pure &quot;No, because 
that's what I say&quot; attitude.

If that is so obvious that a wrapper-lib with GPL-with-exception or 
binary-patch violates that licence that would be no problem for you to 
prove that for me... Because now I think that it violates only your view 
of GPL. I've read this license and I just don't see any paragraph that 
forbids linking any GPL-ed code with exceptions to a GPL-ed software. 
Where it is said, that this 100%-GPL-chain has to be infinite? Why is a 
patch violating the license? That would be marked as clearly Non-GPL, so 
where is the problem?

4\/3!!
