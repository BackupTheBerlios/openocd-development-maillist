You maybe are holder, maintainer, contributor ... but you are not the 
CREATOR / AUTHOR !

Please respect MR. Dominic Rath. He is the CREATOR of OpenOCD 2004 (with 
1-2 years or more of intensive coding)

I was myself a contributor to the project, but before there ais SVN ! 
Yes, strange for you.
But I am a contributor too.

What 'project contribution' means for you?
- Adding a lot of patches
- Donating hardware to end-users
- Building binary for easy-of-use
- Reading the forum
- Writing to the forum
- Documenting the project
- ...

All these tasks were needed to bring OpenOCD as it is actually.

Each project/products needs manager - developer - tester - distributor - 
end-userSSSSSSSSS
The end-users know what they need.

OpenOCD has a success story as open source from 2004. Please respect the 
story !

Until now, the success story says D2XX is needed ! Sorry, it is.

I am sure there will be better GPL code to push the D2XX out from the 
source.
You will have a better GPL but a lot of regression regarding final speed.

This is  my opinion.

&gt;<i> You have abdicated your authority in this community, and I resent your
</I>&gt;<i> showing up here and making threats to remove my code.  I have asserted
</I>&gt;<i> my rights after making a clear case that I have earned the privilege to
</I>&gt;<i> do so.  You have effectively admitted to your own negligence with
</I>&gt;<i> regards to licensing, which you must now accept like a grown-up.  Sorry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am trying to work with the community.  What are you trying to do?
</I>&gt;<i> Who is the totalitarian dictator here?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;/ Not that I think that any remotely sane court would consider your
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ claim, but I certainly wont take this chance. You've been threatening
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ me personally with potential legal actions at least twice, and this is
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ nothing I'm willing to accept.
</I>&gt;<i> /
</I>&gt;<i> I am threatening violators with action.  Are you a violator?  No, and I
</I>&gt;<i> would not take action against you unless you violated my copyrights,
</I>&gt;<i> which I have no reason to believe is the case or would be.  Right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will also say again that I am not interested in taking action for any
</I>&gt;<i> past violations, but I am willing to defend my rights in the future.
</I>&gt;<i> This position was made clear by me from the outset.  Your opinion about
</I>&gt;<i> what a &quot;remotely sane court&quot; would or would not consider is exactly
</I>&gt;<i> that, and you need to decide whether you are willing to test it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please get legal counsel before taking any action with the repository,
</I>&gt;<i> unless you would like to help constructively move the community out of
</I>&gt;<i> this morass.  That will be my primary intention and focus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;/ Please think about what you've just suggested and feel free to clarify
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ your point.
</I>&gt;<i> /
</I>&gt;<i> Ditto.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
