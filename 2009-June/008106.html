<PRE>Hi,

I have just compiled OpenOCD and I had more problems then expected (more
then with the old version).

As my small contribution, I am making this summary so that it can
possibly be improuved.

svn version 2218, Ubuntu 8.04

1) When configure was checking for libftdxx, I had a bad time finding
where it should go and what it should be named. The expected path/file
could be included in the error message, it would have saved a lot of
trouble.

The exact name is also an issue, when compililing libftd2xx.so is used, 
but when run, libftd2xx.so.0 is used. This could be possibly a problem
somewhere.

2) after I started compiling, I had an error because &quot;makeinfo&quot; was
missing. I supose that this should be checked by configure. It also
would help to say that it is part of &quot;texinfo&quot;

3) without the option --enable-maintainer-mode it does not compile to
the end, this is probably a bug, otherwise the option would not have
existed.

I agree that there is a message from .bootstrap, but it does not show
when repeating the command, so I missed it ;-)


Thanks for all :)
Alain Mouette
