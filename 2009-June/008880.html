<PRE>Hello,
I try to use openocd with a Luminary EK-LM3S9B90 Board.
This is the first time I try to use openocd and I hope I could post this question to the List.

The EK-LM3S9B90  Board has an extra JTAG-Interface-Board with a FT2232D chip.
I set following in the cfg file,
ft2232_device_desc &quot;Luminary Micro ICDI Board&quot;
ft2232_vid_pid 0x0403 0xbcda
ft2232_layout evb_lm3s811

but I get a JTAG-communication failure with this settings.

What I have to do to add this Interface-board to Openocd?

First, is there already an Adapter with the Pinning below which I can use?

Is there a Documentation with the Pinnings and the differences of the supported JTAG-Interfaces?
I looked a little bit around in the sources, tried to read some documentation, but not very successful.

Do I have to add the Interface in the C-Sources, if yes what files I have to modify?
I found the ft2232_layout_t array in the ft2322.c, where different initialisation and reset 
functions are defined.


The Pining of the Ft2232 is the following if I understood everything right:

(TCK  -&gt; ADBUS0)
(TDI  -&gt; ADBUS1 (Output from JTAG-Board, TDI on Controller Side))
(TDO  -&gt; ADBUS2 (Input for JTAG-Board, TDO on Controller Side))
(TMS  -&gt; ADBUS3)
(SRST -&gt; ADBUS5)

There is an enable signal for all JTAG Drivers connected to ADBUS6.
There is a Signal called DBGMOD (ADBUS7) which enables or disables the TMS Driver and makes some 
further switching with the TDO/TMS Signals. Seems, that it is for a kind of Single-wire 
Communication over TMS, is this knownin other JTAG Interfaces?

The second Interface (BDBUS) of the ft2322 is used as UART and is connected to controller too,
I think for build-in Bootloader support of the LM3sB90.


By the way, I tried to compile openocd trunk with static linking for the ftd2xx driver, I get no 
errors during configuration and compiling, but the linker cant't find the FT_xxxxx Functions from 
the ../static-lib/libftd2xx.a.0.4.16. pathes seems to be correct.
with shared, I can start openocd. any Idea ?? (System is Ubuntu, with gcc4.2.4)

I can start openocd only with sudo, as normal user I get a segfault.

Best regards
  Arne
