</I>
Technically, I agree.  Politically, I think it better to find a solution
for binary distribution.  That said, the technical argument probably
deserves to win.  Others need to provide feedback; I will not dictate
our release goals, but I will help lead us to them.

&gt;<i> b) Given the number of revisions and releases of OpenOCD out in the  
</I>&gt;<i> wild, and the lack of any conflict to date (other than the thought  
</I>&gt;<i> experiments posted on the list), do you feel it is a #1 priority to  
</I>&gt;<i> solve for 0.2.0?  I have seen a couple of scattered opinions, but am  
</I>&gt;<i> not clear on how a final decision will be made for this release.   
</I>&gt;<i> Statements such as &quot;we must do this&quot; don't fly with me since prior  
</I>&gt;<i> releases have gone out and the Sun did not go nova.
</I>
Well, I think there is value to start pumping out releases, regardless
of the potential binary distribution problems.  I think Rick is right
that these can be worked in parallel, and waiting would only hold back
everyone that uses source code distribution or can do without FTD2XX.

There are few reasons to delay pursuing releases, but I do not want that
to prevent distribution solutions from being developed.  Due to the
recent confusion and scattering to action on new problems, resources are
indeterminate at the moment.  I cannot say where we stand, so I am
reluctant to make any release decisions yet.

&gt;<i> c) Aren't there GPL applications on Linux that can load binary DLL's,  
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know, say the Flash plugin ?
</I>
I will not comment on other projects, sorry.  This stuff is complicated.

&gt;<i> d) Is it worth our time to talk to FTDI and see if they can move to  
</I>&gt;<i> GPL ?
</I>
LGPL would be fine, but YES YES YES.  If you have contacts and leverage,
then you are encouraged to use them to this end.  The more users that
ask them, the more likely they will be to change their minds.  I hope.

If someone gets a meaningful answer from them that explains why they
could never do that, then please post it.  If they are simply protecting
their library IP, then keep putting pressure on them.  Gentle, kind,
loving pressure; you know -- the kind that smothers and suffocates.  

Torches and pitchforks will work better when delivered with a smile and
a friendly attitude.  We mean business, but we must use the diplomatic
approach here -- FTDI has done us no real harm.  They are not an enemy,
but neither does their present license make them our friend.

&gt;<i> e) What concrete benefits does the *existing* OpenOCD derive from  
</I>&gt;<i> being GPL licensed, as compared to BSD license ?
</I>
OpenOCD is GPL.  The short answer is &quot;enforceable freedoms&quot;, but this is
not the time or the place to debate licensing pros and cons.  Sorry. :)

Thanks,

Zach
