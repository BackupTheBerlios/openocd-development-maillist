I never gave such a non-explanation.  You, however, seem not to
have looked at the information you were repeatedly given.  Or
perhaps, just not accepted it.

You've certainly received more detailed answers than &quot;period&quot;,
many times.  That makes it very easy to conclude dishonesty
is *way* up there in your motives, even if you don't choose
to acknowledge that to yourself.  (Of course, your repeated
proposals to completely ignore, or subvert, the license just
emphasise that point.)


&gt;<i> Or maybe you already have, and that's the reason  
</I>&gt;<i> why I haven't received any explanation...
</I>
The *VERY FIRST* message I sent on the topic referenced:

 <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLIncompatibleLibs">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLIncompatibleLibs</A>

Accordingly, your saying you never received any explanation
is a lie.

Maybe you didn't read it.  Maybe you refused to understand it.
But you did receive it ... and from more folk than just me.


Also see a bit later in that same file:

 <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLIncompatibleAlone">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLIncompatibleAlone</A>

Which includes:

  If a program P is released under the GPL that means *any and every
  part of it* can be used under the GPL. If you integrate module Q,
  and release the combined program P+Q under the GPL, that means any
  part of P+Q can be used under the GPL. One part of P+Q is Q. So
  releasing P+Q under the GPL says that Q - any part of it - can be
  used under the GPL. Putting it in other words, a user who obtains P+Q
  under the GPL can delete P, so that just Q remains, still under the GPL.

  If the license of module Q permits you to give permission for that,
  then it is GPL-compatible. Otherwise, it is not GPL-compatible.

For &quot;P&quot; read &quot;OpenOCD&quot;.  For &quot;Q&quot; read FTDI's D2XX library.  Quite
obviously, FTDI's code is not GPL-compatible; no source available
is just the most obvious issue.  Q.E.D.


 
&gt;<i> Really - I asked that in several places and no explanation what-so-ever...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Why a &quot;wrapper&quot; library which would be GPL-with-exception-for-ftd2xx 
</I>&gt;<i> cannot be linked with OpenOCD? I don't see ANY phrase in GPL that says 
</I>&gt;<i> that GPL can be linked only to 100%-GPL-stuff-without-exceptions. 
</I>&gt;<i> Moreover - I see no sentence which says that &quot;GPL-chain&quot; has to be 
</I>&gt;<i> infinite. Really - quote that for me, if the explanations are so simple.
</I>
See the first reference above re terminating the chain in
system libraries.

See my original post where I pointed out relicensing with
an exception would be an option.

See ... how your first &quot;no explanation&quot; whine was in fact
fully addressed at the very beginning of the flamewar you
have been feeding.



&gt;<i> Quote the license and explain to me, why it forbids me to distribute any 
</I>&gt;<i> of that
</I>
Why don't you explain why this is such a burr under your saddle.

Are you a distributor?  If so, why aren't you having this
conversation with your own legal team?
