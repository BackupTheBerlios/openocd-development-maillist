<PRE>This:

&gt;<i> Certain People were on the verge of getting blacklisted...
</I>
with this:

&gt;<i> This *has* been explained.  The issue wasn't lack of explanation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It was unwillingness to *accept* the explanation ... combined
</I>&gt;<i> with not presenting a viable alternative.  Some folk clearly
</I>&gt;<i> haven't bothered to read any of the references supplied, much
</I>&gt;<i> less the license in the source files.  Such unwillingness does
</I>&gt;<i> not indicate an honest disagreement.  IMO it shows dishonesty.
</I>
Is really funny... If you consider &quot;That violates the GPL, period&quot; an 
explanation, than go ahead and black-list me, because I don't understand 
such &quot;explanations&quot;. Or maybe you already have, and that's the reason 
why I haven't received any explanation...

Really - I asked that in several places and no explanation what-so-ever...

1. Why a &quot;wrapper&quot; library which would be GPL-with-exception-for-ftd2xx 
cannot be linked with OpenOCD? I don't see ANY phrase in GPL that says 
that GPL can be linked only to 100%-GPL-stuff-without-exceptions. 
Moreover - I see no sentence which says that &quot;GPL-chain&quot; has to be 
infinite. Really - quote that for me, if the explanations are so simple.

2. I also haven't seen any explanation about the &quot;binary patch&quot;, that 
would be marked as Non-GPL. Maybe I remember &quot;this violates GPL, 
period.&quot; explanation, so sorry - I'm not convinced either.

3. Why a dummy ftd2xx.dll which could be replaced with real one violates 
the license? Yes - it's one and only reason would be to allow the users 
to use a better code, but I still don't see any sentence in the license 
that says something like &quot;whatever that could be considered as avoiding 
the license is forbidden&quot;.

Quote the license and explain to me, why it forbids me to distribute any 
of that. Or blacklist me if you have no other arguments than &quot;this 
violates GPL, period&quot; - but please tell me, I'll stop wasting my time 
trying to send any reason to your mailbox.

Really the ONLY explanation so far has been &quot;This violates GPL&quot;... W-H-Y 
and W-H-E-R-E?

4\/3!!
