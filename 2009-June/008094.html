I think the OpenOCD configure script still stands to be improved, and
you are hitting on one of the biggest areas remaining to be addressed.

All of the --with options should accept a package's &quot;prefix&quot;, such that
you should be able to say --with-libftdi=/usr/local and have things work
as you expected.  Simultaneously, some parts of the existing --with
options would need to be converted into --enable options instead (e.g.
static vs. shared).  This basic --with-&lt;package&gt; idiom comes from the
autoconf info pages, not me.

Given the apparent desire to support raw (not-installed) library source
packages, this means we may also need to allow for additonal options:
--with-&lt;package&gt;-includes and --with-&lt;package&gt;-libs. I would hope that
such pain could be avoided (probably not with Windows).  

Beyond this, I have ideas about extending this support such that OpenOCD
can build and use both libftdi and ftd2xx driver variants at once, not
just one or the other as supported currently.  That goes for both the
libfdti and presto drivers; it's just some more autotools magic, and it
would best be accomplished in the same patch series as the above rework.

In total, I see a few hours to a day of work and testing that need to be
done (when one considers all of the follow-up to fix cross-platform
breakage that is bound to happen).  Patches developed that addressed
these issues could be accepted quickly; they will make it easier to
build OpenOCD on standards-deviant distributions.  Presently, we seems
to be more deviant in this particular way as an individual package.

Personally, I am not motivated to pursue these fixes: patches welcome.

Cheers,

Zach
