Yet my example of a &quot;flash download&quot; tool seems more
like (B) to me.  :)

Keep in mind also that while some &quot;day to day&quot; users are
using GDB-over-JTAG to develop microcontroller software,
others have more limited and infrequent demands, like
de-bricking or (similar) installing new boot loaders.

And I'd say that the former will be getting deeply
familiar with command line tools, of necessity ... the
latter are the ones most in need of the kind of &quot;low
learning overhead&quot; interface which motivates GUIs or
turnkey command frameworks.


Plus, semi-related, this project is not doing much right
now to facilitate even basic task-oriented scripting;
so the limits of what can be done without GUIs are not
even in sight yet.

I notice the &quot;Scripting Overview&quot; (in the Doxygen output,
technical primers section) has this disturbing statement
right at the top:

   The scripting support is intended for developers of
   OpenOCD. It is not the intention that normal OpenOCD
   users will use tcl scripting extensively, write lots
   of clever scripts, or contribute back to OpenOCD.

Well, why the heck should users *NOT* use the scripting?
Or contribute?  Color me puzzled.  Classically, those
are the primary reasons to include scripting.

And if users don't contribute scripts, how *do* they
help grow support for more systems?  And how *could* the
developers really understand user requirements?
