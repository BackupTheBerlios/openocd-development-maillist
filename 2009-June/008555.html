</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Because you are only a fraction of the community and the community as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a whole decides.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wrong.  A single copyright holder can prevent changes to the license.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi.  That's me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Your changes can be reverted and your copyrighted code removed.  You  
are a single copyright holder and cannot speak for the entire  
community.  Nor can you prevent the community from doing anything.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Why do you feel it necessary to disrespect
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> our copyright claims?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't see how he is.  Now, the two interpretations of the license
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> allow slightly different uses, but that isn't disrespect, it's a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> difference of opinion.  One that can't be settled by restating each
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other's side.  There needs to be discussion or an actual legal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> analysis that shows which interpretation is correct.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you dispute my claims to some fraction of the copyrights to  
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD?
</I>
Not at all.

&gt;<i> Do you believe that fraction to be sufficient to give me legal  
</I>&gt;<i> standing?
</I>
Certainly, as long as the code you claim copyright on is still part of  
the source tree.  That doesn't mean that your interpretation of the  
license has any standing, however.  You can certainly choose to take  
it to a court and see which interpretation wins.

&gt;<i> I believe that I can make such claims.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You can claim anything you want, but until an interpretation is shown  
to be &quot;correct&quot; by having it sided with in court, it is not definitive.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If we interpret it thusly, why do you think that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> your interpretation should be considered more valid than ours view?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> What if I told you that my interpretation is based in part on having
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> paid an attorney to counsel me in such nuances?  Would that matter?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Probably, but so far, we've seen nothing but conjecture from both  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sides.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> True.  It would take a court battle to find out anything certain here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You are being disrespectful to contributors that have made this
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> decision; it is theirs to make and theirs alone.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No, the decision was to distribute under the GPL, not a specific
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interpretation of the GPL.  If it turns out that Freddie's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interpretation has more legal ground, then you are stuck with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> complying.  That also isn't being disrespectful.  It's being true to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the letter of the license.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I feel fairly confident that I understand these terms of the GPL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In that way, there is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> no doubt that you _are_ creating problems by beating this dead  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> horse.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is only no doubt to you and a few others.  This isn't a dead
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> horse to the community.  It's a discussion where a few people want
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their way and refuse to hold discussion about alternatives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From the perspective of my contributions, it is dead.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> What will it take to get you and others to drop this issue?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> An actual resolution by the community and not a triumvirate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> declaration based on their interpretation of the license.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think you have a misunderstanding about copyright law.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
No, actually I'm quite familiar with it.  You seem to be under the  
misunderstanding about copyright law's implications on a source base  
with many contributors.  You can assert your rights on the code you  
claim copyright on and nothing else.  Your copyright can also be  
nullified by replacing that code with a different implementation.   
Further, your rights on your code contributions do _not_ mean that you  
get to apply your interpretation of the license.

The community as a whole can easily decide to remove your code,  
replace it, and relicense.  The community can also choose to follow an  
alternate interpretation of the license that you may not agree with.   
Again, you have no rights to declare which interpretation must be  
followed.  Your rights only extend to bring a court case to decide the  
claims.  The community must reach a resolution and individual members  
don't have the rights to assert that theirs must be used.
