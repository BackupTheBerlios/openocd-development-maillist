<PRE>I've had a bit of problems with Cygwin and svn eol native
option.

I thought I understood what was going on and I went ahead and
did some changes to svn head, but I have since discovered that
I do *not* understand what's going on so svn head is a bit in
limbo...

1. &quot;guess-rev.sh&quot; was busted because Cygwin will fail to execute
it when checked out with native. I ran dos2unix and removed the
native option. It now works.

2. I ran into problems with Makefile.am and configure.in not having
Unix line endings and Cygwin failing to run &quot;make maintainer-clean&quot;
deleting &quot;ltmain.sh&quot; and various other files.

I did some tests and it seemed that the problem &quot;make maintainer-clean&quot;
problem was due to the svn native option and Cygwin getting confused.

&quot;Great! I thought, I know how to fix that!&quot; So I committed a fix to remove
svn eol line endings for Makefile.am and configure.in.

Only it didn't fix the problem w/&quot;make maintainer-clean&quot;

So now I have a situation in Cygwin w/Eclipse/Windows svn client
where:

- I don't know understand why ltmain.sh isn't removed during &quot;make
maintainer-clean&quot;
- I saw &quot;ltmain.sh&quot; being removed by &quot;make maintainer-clean&quot; but I
don't know what I did to make that happen and I can't reproduce
this behaviour under Cygwin.
- Makefile.am and configure.in no longer has the svn native line endings
under in svn head.
- There is clear evidence that it is *wrong* to use svn eol native for
.sh files but it is unclear what to do with other files that Cygwin
reads...
