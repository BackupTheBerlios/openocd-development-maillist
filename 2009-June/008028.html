IMHO that's the best solution (right after &quot;relicensing&quot;). Unfortunately 
right now OpenOCD compiled with support for ft2232 just won't start 
without that library. Even if you are planning to use Wiggler, OpenOCD 
just won't start without it. Please notice, that anyone who wishes to 
use a ft2232 device with original drivers just HAS to have that library 
installed in OS. It gets installed along with the drivers. If the 
library would be linked dynamically, for me that would be &quot;plugin&quot;. Just 
as the user who wishes to use a FT2232-based dongle is expected to have 
the drivers, he would be expected to have a library, which in general 
would be the same, because of what I wrote 4 lines above.

The totally perfect solution would be for OpenOCD to use whichever 
library the user provides - libusb of the one from FTDI, but I suppose 
that is not possible... );

Why the system routines are allowed (you won't ever see the code for 
printf() in Windows, and it is user by almost every program), and the 
libraries that are an INTEGRAL part of a driver are not? Library is 
useless without the driver. The driver is useless without the library...

You (I mean generally) bring the argument, that everyone has to agree 
for relicensing. Do notice, that this change is not meant to make 
OpenOCD a closed-source project. Its MAJOR (only?) purpose would be to 
make OpenOCD available in an easy package for as many users as possible. 
If anyone wants to make OpenOCD some kind of l33t project for h4x0rs 
than I wouldn't take him serious... That's a pretty simple choice - 
OpenOCD for everyone or OpenOCD just for those who will &quot;upgrade from 
Windows to Linux&quot;. Do remember, that some people don't have a choice 
about the system, because of the employer's decisions or policies or 
whatever.

4\/3!!
