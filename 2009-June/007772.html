Though &quot;mdw&quot; is really impractical for scripting.  The &quot;memread32&quot;
thing would be better ... but notice that *it* ignores $TARGETNAME
too, for much the same reason other scripts can't use it.

A third option:  too painful to use.  How exactly is $_TARGETNAME
going to get *into* the event handler since nothing binds the right
value to that name??

I'll tell you how.  By hard-wiring a particular target name.  Which
means non-reusable code.  But ... the entire point of switching to
that new &quot;$target_name mww addr value&quot; is reusability, right?  By
decoupling from the &quot;current target&quot; notion.  Else there's no reason
not to continue using un-adorned &quot;mww&quot;...


Some of that's a general event handler issue:  the event handlers
have no invocation-specific context.  They have to be coded to know
they're working on a specific target and event.  They can't know if
the &quot;reset-init&quot; code is going to run later, or if the reset mode
is &quot;run&quot;.

(Example:  &quot;reset run&quot; normally means the first stage loader will
run and set up clocks, so jtag_khz can be upped from pokey-slow to
something non-painful.  Likewise with &quot;reset init&quot;.  But &quot;reset halt&quot;
means I get a bare CPU, in need of serious re-init, and using a slow
JTAG clock...)


&gt;<i> There's a subtle thing here that I did when I created these new

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How?  I *COULD* have made the parameters positional, ie: 'the 5th

</I>&gt;<i> one does not need a comment line above the script command explaining the

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Look at the &quot;flash bank&quot; command as a *nasty* example.
</I>&gt;<i> (tcl/target/sam7x256.cfg - line 48)
</I>
Also known as &quot;require an armload of zeroes before the only
useful parameter&quot;.  What's the &quot;preferred&quot; number of zeroes
lately ...  a dozen?  Sooo easy to lose count there.  :(


&gt;<i> It's not thrash if it becomes *in*line* documentation,
</I>
I'm in favor of non-positional paramters, but that's unrelated
to my point:  that the changes you suggest touch a *LOT* of code,
forcing a flag day ... but for relatively minor benefit.

One could for example adopt the coding convention incrementally,
withoug the &quot;flag day&quot; provision of your &quot;part #1&quot;.  No code
thrash at all.


&gt;<i> think +2 years  
</I>&gt;<i> from now, with +10 more targets, and +10 more boards, they will be 
</I>&gt;<i> better documented, that is the bigger win.
</I>
If only ten more targets and boards appear in two years, this
project won't have lived up to a fraction of its potential.
Heck, I've got at least five more ARM boards I could hook up,
and a few non-ARM ones.

Expect at least ten more boards by the 0.3 release, and that
should be a more realistic model.  Maybe they won't all have
nontrivial configs -- as in, DRAM initialized, and OpenOCD
can replace their bootloaders -- but I think there must be
a lot of &quot;low hanging fruit&quot; lurking.
