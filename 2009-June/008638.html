<PRE>  Hello:

   I'll just participate in this horrible flame once.

</I>
  You are not less important, you are just another kind. &quot;Clients&quot; are 
important as well, just that you (we) don't pay for using the software. Having 
said this I don't understand how you (or anyone sensible) could support 
violating licenses. Do you have the habit of breaking laws for the sake of it?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why would anyone want to waste time and effort on fixing this purely
</I>&gt;<i> theoretic issue? Use the time to implement useful features like SWD or
</I>&gt;<i> threadsupport instead.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 700 mails about it. You of all people can fix it easily. Give up your
</I>&gt;<i> copyright or allow relicensing it under anything that is not as gray and
</I>&gt;<i> debatable as GPL.
</I>
  I don't think enforcing one's rights is loosing time. This is not a 
theoretic issue. GPL is the license and it states that whatever you link 
against and distribute should respect GPL freedom, among others, being able to 
get the source code.

  You can do things about this, for instance persuading FTDI to free the 
FTD2xx driver source and relicense it with GPL or any other compatible license 
for the issue: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">admin1 at ftdichip.com</A>

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a sidenote I still don't see the issue. The spirit of GPL is to allow to
</I>&gt;<i> make modifications to an application that is distributed in binary form.
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD with FTD2xx allows this, no discussion! So stop using the FAQ of
</I>&gt;<i> people holier then the pope to argument OpenOCD can't be released on
</I>&gt;<i> Windows.
</I>
  You wouldn't be able to do modifications on the FTD2xx library, so no point 
for this.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I really don't get it. If OpenOCD were my &quot;baby&quot; I would like to see it get
</I>&gt;<i> popular and loved around the world. What's the use of having a super-great
</I>&gt;<i> application that nobody will use because some people are stubborn and don't
</I>&gt;<i> see further then idealistic BS.
</I>
  If OpenOCD or whatever other is my &quot;baby&quot;, I would do what I would like with 
it. Trying to get it popular, maybe not, give it for free, get paid for it or 
even license it under GPL terms. In this case rules were dictated from the 
beginning.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just my 2 cents but I'm quite sure a lot more people are getting tired of
</I>&gt;<i> this. Change the license or ignore the theoretic violation and get the next
</I>&gt;<i> version out there in binary form for Windows using FTD2xx.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
  If you (or others) are so interested in a license change, then answer this 
questions:

  &#183; Have you contacted every copyright holder and ask for his opinion?
  &#183; if (s)he is reluctant to change license what will give you in 
compensation?
  &#183; Are you willing to pay money for the work they have done to change 
license?
  &#183; Are you willing to accept anyone is not going to admit a license change?

  License is not democracy, not even meritocracy, is consensus. License is 
what it is and only an agreement of all copyright holders can change that.

&gt;<i> If I had something to say I would ask every contributor to state if they
</I>&gt;<i> allow a relicense. If not, strip out their code and rewrite it. That can't
</I>&gt;<i> take longer then making the workarounds people are discussing now. While
</I>&gt;<i> we're at it, demand that contributors donate their copyright to the OpenOCD
</I>&gt;<i> foundation or whatever, so these discussions are a thing of the past. I
</I>&gt;<i> don't want to run a 2nd application to be able to use FTD2xx on windows. I
</I>&gt;<i> already have to run OpenOCD and gdb, more then enough to keep track off.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> gr.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ronald
</I>
  What I don't understand so far is why it is so important to add an exception 
to the license instead of:

  &#183; Improving free FTDI library
  &#183; Asking FTDI to release and free the FTD2xx library
  &#183; Make people interested in running FTD2xx build his own copy/binary of 
openocd

  Most of this options requires less work than tirelessly quarreling on the 
list. It is possible not using FTD2xx, it is also possible using it. Whoever 
is interested enough on any of those aspects should care for it, but not 
putting pressure or insulting(*) developers to do what they claim. Why is it 
easier to put pressure on developers who actually does a great job and not on 
a company that should encourage its products to be sell?

(*) I don't refer you, Ronald.
