I've had to do SPI over FT232 and that's where I noticed
that the documentation was seriously lacking.

You can view JTAG as a combination of:

 (a) state transitions driven by TMS + TCK
 (b) SPI (TMS == chipselect) in the xRSHIFT states


&gt;<i> The protocols available for FT232 are well published, it is not hard but 
</I>&gt;<i> unpleasant to implement JTAG on them, that is what interfaces like the 
</I>&gt;<i> Altera USB Blaster does.
</I>
If they are &quot;well published&quot; that's news to me.  I found
significant holes.  One example is just the differences
between the FT232B and FT232R revisions.  I think it was
winter 2006-2007 where I did that; maybe docs have been
fixed since then.

The &quot;Official Answer&quot; from FTDI was to use D2XX library.
Any &quot;well published&quot; docs related to that library, not to
commands at the chip level.

I suppose I could have stuck a USB sniffer on the wire
and watched what their library did with each API call.
The need for that level work highlights the doc holes


&gt;<i> But JTAG over MPSSE is soo much nicer that nobody who has worked with

</I>
Agreed, JTAG over MPSSE is better.  And a part of that
is that the docs actually cover all the registers and
commands you can issue, so you're not left guessing.
