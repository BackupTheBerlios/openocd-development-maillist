Because you are only a fraction of the community and the community as  
a whole decides.

&gt;<i> Why do you feel it necessary to disrespect
</I>&gt;<i> our copyright claims?
</I>
I don't see how he is.  Now, the two interpretations of the license  
allow slightly different uses, but that isn't disrespect, it's a  
difference of opinion.  One that can't be settled by restating each  
other's side.  There needs to be discussion or an actual legal  
analysis that shows which interpretation is correct.

&gt;<i> If we interpret it thusly, why do you think that
</I>&gt;<i> your interpretation should be considered more valid than ours view?
</I>&gt;<i> What if I told you that my interpretation is based in part on having
</I>&gt;<i> paid an attorney to counsel me in such nuances?  Would that matter?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Probably, but so far, we've seen nothing but conjecture from both sides.

&gt;<i> You are being disrespectful to contributors that have made this
</I>&gt;<i> decision; it is theirs to make and theirs alone.
</I>
No, the decision was to distribute under the GPL, not a specific  
interpretation of the GPL.  If it turns out that Freddie's  
interpretation has more legal ground, then you are stuck with  
complying.  That also isn't being disrespectful.  It's being true to  
the letter of the license.

&gt;<i> In that way, there is
</I>&gt;<i> no doubt that you _are_ creating problems by beating this dead horse.
</I>
There is only no doubt to you and a few others.  This isn't a dead  
horse to the community.  It's a discussion where a few people want  
their way and refuse to hold discussion about alternatives.

&gt;<i> What will it take to get you and others to drop this issue?
</I>
An actual resolution by the community and not a triumvirate  
declaration based on their interpretation of the license.
