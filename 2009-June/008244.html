====

You miss an important point, it is *NOT* the possible range of values 
the *TYPE* may take on.

It is the range of values the **ACTUAL*DATA** might take on that is 
important here.
Consider:

    uint32_t x;
    void funny_function( uint32_t );

    for( x = 0 ; x &lt; 10 ; x++ ){
          printf(&quot; X = %d, Calling funny function\n&quot;, (int)(x));
          funny_function( x ) ;
    }

In the above, I have several choices, (a) I could have used an &quot;int&quot; 
variable - then *cast* it to a uint32_t at the function call (note here: 
I am partial to x as a loop control variable, others like i/j/k) or - 
because (b) the value will never be negative, I just choose 'uint32_t' 
because it was convient.

Is the printf() statement *WRONG* - or is the printf() statement 
*CORRECT* in this senario.

====

If we had to fix this, what would we do to fix this:

Today - we do not have macros, or types like GDB/GCC/GAS.
GDB for instance uses CORE_ADDR - and has infrastructure behind it.

Here, under OpenOCD we generally:

(1) assume that all embedded openocd targets are *32bit* at most...
(2) assume all host platforms are at least 32bit host platforms
(3) and thus, target addresses are generally equal to - or smaller then 
the host &quot;unsigned integers&quot;
(4) In most, if not all of the &quot;u32&quot; cases, the format string specifies 
&quot;%08x&quot; or equal.

Are these assumptions *wrong*? If so, we have major other problems we 
must deal with.

====

There are numerous examples of this where - for instance the code does 
the following:

      LOG_ERROR(&quot;Verfication error address 0x%08x, read back 0x%02x, 
expected 0x%02x&quot;, address + wrote + i, readback[i], chunk[i]);

In this specific case, the *correct* fix is something else.

The &quot;address&quot; parameter really needs a *function* that handles the width 
value. Otherwise, a &quot;64bit&quot; target will not work. We are not proposing 
to fix these situations today are we? Doing so would really be better 
served by a function something like:

          char *target_address_as_hex( CORE_ADDR  address_value );

One can 'question' the two 8bit values printed, allow me to make my 
point another way.

====

Here is another example:

    LOG_INFO( &quot;device id = 0x%08x (manuf 0x%03x dev 0x%02x, ver 0x%03x)&quot;,
    device_id, (device_id&gt;&gt;1)&amp;0x7ff, (device_id&gt;&gt;12)&amp;0xff, 
(device_id&gt;&gt;20)&amp;0xfff );

The format strings alone tell me that a 32bit unsigned *INTEGER* is 
sufficient.
As does the math operators.

Since our *basic* assumption of the host platform is at least a &quot;32bit 
unsigned int&quot;
A simple cast is valid here.

Are you suggesting that our *basic* host assumption is wrong?            

====

duane&gt;  9) a cast to a basic type in this case is the K.I.S.S. 
solution.duane&gt;

zach&gt;   I don't care one white about KISS if the code is wrong.

Is this a pedantic position/point you are trying to make?

The code today has *major* problems if/when we have a 64bit target.
The code is more *wrong* when we have 32bit hosts and 64bit targets.

-Duane.
