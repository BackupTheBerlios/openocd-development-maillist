This fails to demonstrate a mature, professional attitude, but I hope
that you can engage in a rational discussion about this topic.

&gt;<i> In my long career, I have seen too many poor souls - including my self

On the opposite side of the coin, I have seen too many programmers rely
on extra parentheses because they do not _know_ C operator precedence.
There are cases that deserve extra parenthesis, but not on that line. 

If removing braces from single-line statements breaks something, then
the statement itself was broken (e.g. a macro lacking do { } while(0)
wrap) or something else needs to be fixed.

&gt;<i> Openocd is not, and should never become an entry in the 'obfuscated C 
</I>&gt;<i> code contest[1]'.  It seems that we are heading down that road.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/screaming-rant&gt;
</I>
Seriously?  You think that my efforts have increased the obfuscation?
My principle aim has been to improve the readability of the code, so I
have to wonder whether others agree with this particular assessment.

Cheers,

Zach
