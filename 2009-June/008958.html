FTDIchip.com can do whatever they want, but folk distributing
OpenOCD binaries must obey the GPL.  And that precludes use
of the D2XX library from FTDI.

Absolutely.  That's the preferred way to use FTDI's code with
GPL-licensed software:  build it yourself.  If you're using
MS-Windows, that's your best solution for using OpenOCD at
the moment.


&gt;<i> as long &#160;as I am not selling some kind of debugger that has

FTDI doesn't much care what you do with their library.
They make it available for free (&quot;Free as in Beer&quot;).


&gt;<i> Perhaps I could find the latest FTDI library on thier web site ?
</I>
In fact that should be *very* easy to find, they want you
to do that.  It's just that their distribution terms are
not compatible with GPL, so the two chunks of software can't
be distributed together.

No worries if you just want to build a personal copy of the
OpenOCD software combined with the FTDI library.  Just Do It.
