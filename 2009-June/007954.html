Brief updates below.  I can almost see the JRC stuff being fully
usable in the 0.2.0 release ... it seems like it's nearly there ...


&gt;<i> In no particular order, and with no expectation of completeness:

</I>&gt;<i>  - Can't handle IDCODE instruction for these DSPs, since the

</I>&gt;<i>    (I want to be able to look at *every* JRC port, to know
</I>&gt;<i>    that the code behaves in more than one single case.)
</I>
Still open.  I don't expect this fixed in 0.2.0 code.


&gt;<i>  - The current *model* of TAP enable/disable is a bit off.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      *	There are two disable modes, but the code only has
</I>&gt;<i> 	one right now.  We should interpret the &quot;-disable&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 	option on TAP creation to reflect the state after
</I>&gt;<i> 	exit from the JTAG Test_Logic_Reset state (doc fix
</I>&gt;<i> 	for 0.2 IMO).  The *desired runtime state* is a
</I>&gt;<i> 	different beast, AFAICT.
</I>
Fixed in a patch I just sent.


&gt;<i>      *	Related, enabling TAPs is currently only done by
</I>&gt;<i> 	a &quot;jtag tapenable $TAP&quot; command.  It should be
</I>&gt;<i> 	abstracted so it's done automatically in cases like
</I>&gt;<i> 	initializing an ETM bound to a disabled ETB, and
</I>&gt;<i> 	to re-enable after some code triggered TLR.
</I>
I expect that for 0.2.0 the workaround will be something
like adding a reset-deassert-post event handler embedding
that knowledge in openocd.cfg files. 


&gt;<i>  - The current TAP enable code is incomplete.  It needs to
</I>&gt;<i>    kick the target(s) asociated with that TAP; examine()
</I>&gt;<i>    it and maybe more.
</I>
Fixed in a patch I just sent.  For examine() only.

 
&gt;<i>  - That TAP enable code is also excessively trusting.  It
</I>&gt;<i>    should verify that the TAP actually appears!  And that
</I>&gt;<i>    it's the expected device.   The latter implies different
</I>&gt;<i>    kind of chain validation than we have now, since it may
</I>&gt;<i>    not enter TLR.  (Presumably we can immediately verify
</I>&gt;<i>    the IR length with IRSCAN.  Though it'd be good to sanity
</I>&gt;<i>    check that we didn't somehow enable *two* adjacent taps.
</I>&gt;<i>    If we know the IDCODE opcode we should then be able to
</I>&gt;<i>    verify the expected TAP id.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  - Similarly with TAP disable.  It should verify that the
</I>&gt;<i>    TAP disappeared.  (We don't currently know how to make
</I>&gt;<i>    the ICEpick-C taps go away, but I'm fairly sure we could
</I>&gt;<i>    find out ... even without a logic analyser watching what
</I>&gt;<i>    happens on the JTAG bus!)
</I>
Both of those issues are still open.  I suspect the enable
checks will be important.


&gt;<i>  - I didn't see an obvious way to guarantee the expected
</I>&gt;<i>    100+ TCK cycles after TLR.  The cleanest way would be
</I>&gt;<i>    to define a new TAP event for TLR exit, and let the
</I>&gt;<i>    JRC provide a method that just does &quot;runtest 100&quot;.
</I>
Open.

 
&gt;<i>  - One of the header files says that interfaces may use
</I>&gt;<i>    arbitrary state transitions.  I think that's got to
</I>&gt;<i>    be changed somewhat ... the new &quot;pathmove&quot; thing is
</I>&gt;<i>    not sufficient, given free running clocks.  The hard
</I>&gt;<i>    and fast rule *here* must be:  never enter RUN/IDLE
</I>&gt;<i>    implicitly.
</I>
Open.  I wonder if I'm hitting a bug there?


&gt;<i>  - Server can come up with the &quot;current&quot; target disabled.
</I>&gt;<i>    That shouldn't be possible.
</I>
Open.

 
&gt;<i> That's all for now.  Comments from anyone who's looked
</I>&gt;<i> at this before?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Dave
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> # jrc          == a JRC tap name
</I>&gt;<i> # port         == a port number, 0..15
</I>&gt;<i> proc icepick_tapenable {jrc port} {
</I>&gt;<i>        irscan $jrc 7 -endstate IRPAUSE
