Notice the complete disregard of technical arguments here.

That's a good sign that the person making the argument has no real
contribution to make, beyond invective.  Or perhaps it's the old
&quot;how to inflate one's ego, at the expense of someone else&quot; thing...



&gt;<i> It's clear to me, that many here have forgotten the main IDEA. The IDEA

Under the GPL.  From the very first public release, that has been
part of it.  You download it, and the GPL is there.  That brings
along with it certain rules.


&gt;<i> that could be used with FT2232-based JTAGs. Now some think the idea is 
</I>&gt;<i> to be Uber-GPL-we-don't-care-for-the-users.
</I>
You're the ONLY one advocating a &quot;we-don't-care-for-X&quot; mindset.

And the problem is that your &quot;X&quot; includes (a) the license agreed to by
at least fifty developers, (b) those developers, (c) common courtesy.

You're also *falsely attributing* a mindset to other people.
That's often called &quot;lying&quot;.
