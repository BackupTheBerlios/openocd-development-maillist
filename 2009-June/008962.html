</I>
I guess my thought was that a simple 'configure' should be enough to run
'make docs' (if all the tools have been installed).  From there, users
could re-run configure with the proper options.  Clearly, it would be
better to have them run it once with the correct options.

&gt;<i> Clearly we're not there today.  Example, &quot;configure&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't just notice that libftdi is present and then
</I>&gt;<i> enable all FT2232-based drivers by default (using that
</I>&gt;<i> code not D2XX).  Or failing that, that D2XX is there.
</I>&gt;<i> (Or failing both, warn that the &quot;signature&quot; support
</I>&gt;<i> of OpenOCD is missing...)  And &quot;configure --help&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't show which settings are default vs not...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I guess I'm thinking I'd like to see the config
</I>&gt;<i> scripts simplified to that point, so that there's
</I>&gt;<i> much less of a need to resolve questions like where
</I>&gt;<i> the doc should sit.  :)
</I>
Yes, but I do not want to muck with those portions of the configure
script at this point.  There are several other things that I want to
&quot;break in order to fix&quot; therein, beyond the problems you mention.

&gt;<i> Plus note the chicken/egg thing:  it should not
</I>&gt;<i> be necessary to build the software in order to get
</I>&gt;<i> docs about how to configure it...
</I>
I am now thinking that all of this information should be contained in
the README file.  

In revisiting this patch, I also started to think about leaving the
INSTALL file unmodified from the GNU version, so it can be updated
easily when upstream changes are made to it.  In that respect, the file
could be removed; it can be replaced automatically by automake during
the bootstrap stage.  I have tested that process here, and it works with
another small patch to switch from --foreign to --gnu mode in our
automake configuration.

Attached is a new patch that can be substituted for the original #6 in
the series.

Cheers,

Zach
