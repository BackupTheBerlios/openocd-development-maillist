Other can provide details; I have some suggestions below.

&gt;<i> I am an end user who is providing developers with field experience on

</I>&gt;<i> of the problems they are encountering ?
</I>
We are planning to start releasing packages more regularly, to prevent
the need for users to use the Subversion repository.  Stay tuned.

&gt;<i> Zach or &#216;yvind,
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
We cannot &quot;build a binary with FTD2XX support for you&quot; because
distributing it to you would violate the GPL (because that library is
closed source).  Someone could build a binary with libftdi support,
because that library is open source and compatible with the distribution
terms of the GPL.  The details are gory, but that's it in a nutshell.

I would suggest reading the COPYING file through; it is enlightening.

&gt;<i> My vender is Olimex, for my jtag, I am not sure about their level
</I>&gt;<i> of support they would provide.
</I>
They have some responsibility for providing support for their product;
however, the OpenOCD community does not.  Still, you will probably find
us more responsive and pro-active, though I could be wrong on this. :)

&gt;<i> Is there a tutorial on building openOCD myself ? 
</I>
I believe one has been posted on the SparkFun forum, though I have
requested patches to add such instructions to the repository itself.
Please let me know if you find instructions that work for you, or
consider producing your own to help improve our in-tree documentation.

&gt;<i> Finally is it a known fact that Luminary parts do not work for
</I>&gt;<i> breakpoints and some new
</I>&gt;<i> version that you have will fix my problem ?? I do not  want to build
</I>&gt;<i> unless
</I>&gt;<i> it will provide a fix for my problems. Or ??
</I>
I cannot say.  You probably need to try it and report your findings.
Furthermore, the initial hurdle of compiling it will position you to
keep up with any changes that do fix that problem (or others).

Cheers,

Zach
