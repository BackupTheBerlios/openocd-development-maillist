You seem to be missing the point.  Once you've used your time to  
contribute, you can never get that time back.  Compensation for the  
time doesn't change that.  You can never undo your contribution and go  
back to where you started.  This is in contrast to purchasing  
something.  In general, you can return the purchase and receive your  
money back.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> As you agreed, I have enough standing to take this as far as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> required in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> an attempt to enforce this interpretation, whether or not I win.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thus,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> my opinion needs to matter for that reason alone, because I am not

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You certainly can, but the community can also decide to remove your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> copyrights from the project and do whatever they want.  At that  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> point,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you have no legal recourse on future distributions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> True.  Is this where you are leaning, personally?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
No, just pointing out that it is an option.  You've been making many  
statements about how things cannot be done because you won't allow it  
as a copyright holder.  Just be aware that being a copyright holder  
doesn't grant you that ability.  You'd be better off discussion things  
rather than attempting to force an outcome via a threat.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I have offered my services repeatedly to those who need it to help
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> resolve this situation with technical solutions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With lots of grandstanding about ensuring those solutions will also  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> covered by the GPL even if there is no strict reason that they must.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please explain this further, particularly the part about &quot;even if  
</I>&gt;<i> there
</I>&gt;<i> is no strict reason that they must&quot;.  I cannot imagine that you are
</I>&gt;<i> suggesting violating the GPL, so this does not parse for me right now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am willing to build GPL-compatible solutions, while others would
</I>&gt;<i> rather try to work around the GPL.  Fixing the open solution is easier
</I>&gt;<i> than trying to change the license, and it's cheaper than paying  
</I>&gt;<i> lawyers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do not want to give my work under a license that lets others get the
</I>&gt;<i> work for free, because it is fair for me to try to make a little money
</I>&gt;<i> for the effort it will take.  Otherwise, what is wrong with the GPL  
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> a reference implementation?  Did you even read the part of the other
</I>&gt;<i> e-mail where I said the door for proprietary work will be open no  
</I>&gt;<i> matter
</I>&gt;<i> what license OpenOCD chooses in this capacity?  And that I would be
</I>&gt;<i> willing to dual-license said work?  What is wrong about any of this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, you acknowledged the &quot;loophole&quot; of a clean implementation of a  
JTAG over TCP/IP library.  That doesn't change your statements that if  
you choose to work on it, it will be licensed under the GPL.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Instead, I am being
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> asked to give up my GPL copyright claims on the work that I have  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> done,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> without any compensation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No one has asked that at all.  Rather, there has been requests to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discuss alternatives to the few Zach sanctioned technical solutions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You don't need to participate in them, but you should recognize that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other copyright holders have the right to discuss alternatives even  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they don't align with your wishes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By asking to add an exception to the license, that is exactly what is
</I>&gt;<i> happening here, unless you would like to remove my changes -- as you
</I>&gt;<i> have repeated pointed out is possible.  Your repetition of this  
</I>&gt;<i> gives me
</I>&gt;<i> concern that you would consider such an option as appealing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You seem to be confusing discussion with resolution.  There has been  
discussion of an exception to the license, not a resolution to do so.   
Therefore, no one has asked you to give up any copyright claims.  In  
fact, a change of licensing wouldn't constitute giving up those claims  
either.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Are you kidding me?  Under what obligation am
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I required to help others that project from violating the GPL  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> license?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> None and no one has asked you to.  There has been no clear resolution
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> either way.  You have expressed your dissent.  Should the community
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decide to do a 0.2.0 release in such a way that violates the GPL and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contains your copyrighted code, you have the ability to assert your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rights via the legal system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have been cajoled and ridiculed for taking my present stance.  I  
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> been seeing a wide range of pressures from users and contributors to
</I>&gt;<i> give the community an exception for this library.  I reject your
</I>&gt;<i> assertion that no one has asked me; I claim that every new request  
</I>&gt;<i> asks
</I>&gt;<i> the same question of me anew.  I am very sensitive to the needs of the
</I>&gt;<i> community, regardless of what you may want to say to the contrary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
There has been lots of discussion about the spectrum of options  
available to the community.  Those are not mandates.  Those are not  
requests for immediate action.  They are discussion to determine the  
proper resolution.  Take a step back and look at the discussions.   
Nowhere has anyone asked or requested that anyone else give up their  
claims to copyright or to change the license.  There is just the  
presentation of possible solutions for evaluation by the community.

&gt;<i> However, I would be screwing a much bigger community than OpenOCD if I
</I>&gt;<i> were to allow an exception to the GPL.  I would be undermining the
</I>&gt;<i> broader free software community.  I can't live with that.  Can you?
</I>&gt;<i> When there are now abundance of compliant technical solutions?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
There are other prominent open-source projects that have provided  
exceptions to the GPL such as GCC.  That didn't undermine the larger  
free software community.  We should also be clear that you are  
referring to the free software community that supports the GPL.  There  
are plenty of other free software communities that prefer other  
licenses that are in many ways more free for both developers and  
users.  Would an exception for FTDI upset Stallman?  Probably.  Would  
it undermine the communities that support the BSD license or enter  
directly into the public domain?  Not a bit.  Personally I find the  
GPL to be too far reaching and limiting to the developers and the  
users.  I'm not going to elaborate since that is far from the point of  
this discussion.

I do respect that OpenOCD is currently licensed under the pure GPL.  I  
also acknowledge that this makes linkage to the D2XX library  
problematic for distribution.  The community (or at least the  
copyright holders) need to come to a consensus on how to resolve this  
and implement it.  Until that happens, discussion on possible ways to  
resolve it are completely appropriate for this list.  I'm firmly  
against any individuals attempting to limit that discussion on the  
basis that they don't agree with certain options.  Just because GPL- 
compliant options have been suggested does _not_ mean that the  
community is limited to choosing from them.

&gt;<i> I said in another thread that I now see this as a &quot;blocker&quot; for 0.2.0.
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD needs to provide a GPL-compliant solution for these users  
</I>&gt;<i> before
</I>&gt;<i> anyone produces more binary releases from the trunk w/ FTD2XX.  Each
</I>&gt;<i> individual distributor can decide for themselves whether or not I have
</I>&gt;<i> the passion and ability to pursue violators to seek such compliance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Technically, nothing is required from the project-side.  The  
infringement happens solely at the time of distribution, not at the  
time of authoring or compilation.  Since OpenOCD is only released as  
source code, the project is not directly affected by any  
infringement.  Doing nothing still leaves packagers and distributors  
open to the possibility of committing infringement rather easily, but  
that is still a choice made by them, not us.  D2xx is by default  
disabled.  _If_ we choose to do anything for 0.2.0, it could be as  
simple as adding a warning that by having D2xx enabled, the resulting  
binaries cannot be distributed.
