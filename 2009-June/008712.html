I have a few questions which I would like each regular contributor to  
assess, if you can spare a few moments:

a) is Rick's last sentence above one that you agree or disagree with ?

b) Given the number of revisions and releases of OpenOCD out in the  
wild, and the lack of any conflict to date (other than the thought  
experiments posted on the list), do you feel it is a #1 priority to  
solve for 0.2.0?  I have seen a couple of scattered opinions, but am  
not clear on how a final decision will be made for this release.   
Statements such as &quot;we must do this&quot; don't fly with me since prior  
releases have gone out and the Sun did not go nova.

c) Aren't there GPL applications on Linux that can load binary DLL's,  
I don't know, say the Flash plugin ?

d) Is it worth our time to talk to FTDI and see if they can move to  
GPL ?

e) What concrete benefits does the *existing* OpenOCD derive from  
being GPL licensed, as compared to BSD license ?
