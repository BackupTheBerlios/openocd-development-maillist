The general rule is that if the binaries run in the same process and/or 
memory space it forms a &quot;combined work&quot;, which must be licensed under the 
GPL. As always, the GPL FAQ is a recommended read.

&gt;<i> 2. I also haven't seen any explanation about the &quot;binary patch&quot;, that
</I>&gt;<i> would be marked as Non-GPL. Maybe I remember &quot;this violates GPL,
</I>&gt;<i> period.&quot; explanation, so sorry - I'm not convinced either.
</I>
Section 2 of the GPLv2 states:

&quot;2.  You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of 
it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such 
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that 
you also meet all of these conditions: ...&quot;

and section 4:

&quot;4.  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program 
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to 
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will 
automatically terminate your rights under this License. ...&quot;

Since section 4 mentions modification separately, my interpretation is 
that you may not even modify a private copy unless it is done according to 
the terms of the GPL. Other people may interpret it differently.

Anyway, with the amount of people who have expressed their concerns about 
the Windows version it shouldn't take that long to develop a proper, 
legally unambiguous solution to this problem rather than trying to hack 
around it rather than just complaining.

Regards,
Anders
