That would be a wonderful situation. Here are my thoughts. I can not
code. But I can certainly help testing. I just need to buy a FT2232x based
Jtag debugger. Or somebody can help me to get one. ;-)

There may be quite some efforts to achieve this. One of the major
obstacles may be to find good Windows driver programmers who
are willing to help. And this will all be post 0.20.

1) Fixing libusb 0.1+libftdi--
Under Linux and Mac OS X, there is libusb 1.0 already.
That may be the way to go. You can probably replace libusb 0.1+libftdi
with libusb 1.0 directly. There will be performance gains. Or it is possible
to get libftdi switching to libusb 1.0 (at least under Linux and Mac OS X).

One example:
<A HREF="http://github.com/qdot/libnifalcon/tree/master">http://github.com/qdot/libnifalcon/tree/master</A>
<A HREF="http://github.com/qdot/libnifalcon/tree/d0f176d9323fc314086f4b54bf5da502cb7d1a62/src/comm">http://github.com/qdot/libnifalcon/tree/d0f176d9323fc314086f4b54bf5da502cb7d1a62/src/comm</A>

For FreeBSD and other users: port libusb 1.0 to your favorite OS. HPS is
now revamping the USB stack for FreeBSD and he has the capability
to port libusb 1.0 to FreeBSD or put up a compatible library since he has
already developed libusb20 compatibility lib for libusb 0.1.

Of course, libusb 0.1 can still be supported, but there may be performance
penalties compared to libusb 1.0.

2) Fixing libusb-win32 0.1+libftdi for Windows.
Solution 1: help libusb-win32 to fix the remaining issue (driver
signing/certification,
USB composite device handling, etc). And maybe fix the performance issue
of libftdi or OpenOCD's way of using libftdi.

Solution 2: port libusb 1.0 to Windows. That would be a nice solution.
It can use the codes from libusb-win32. The driver signing/certification
will still cost money. Then it can use the same code base from 1).
