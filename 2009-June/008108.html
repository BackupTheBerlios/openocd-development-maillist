I guess what I am saying is that if the devices is not there, just 
branch back to main() and start again after a bit of delay (could be an 
option). Or the user could do this on their own in a script.

I meant to say &quot;usb is disconnected&quot;. But if jtag is disconnect (with 
olimex ftdi adapter) it spits out continuous &quot;Warn : Invalid ACK in 
SWJDP transaction&quot; put when I plug the jtag back to the board (currently 
using Olimex stm32-h103) it recovers and I can continue 
stepping/debugging again.

&gt;&gt;<i> disconnected I see a continuous stream of &quot;usb bulk write failed&quot;

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> errors keep coming. The only way to recover is to kill openocd and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> restart it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> same target or not.  This all gets very messy.  So, for now, we should

</I>
Right now it doesn't terminated if USB is disconnects but keeps spitting 
out &quot;usb bulk write failed&quot; messages (for my setup) and won't recover. 
There could be an option to also branch back to main (&quot;reboot&quot; openocd) 
if more than X of these errors occur in a row.  ...Just an idea :)  I 
guess you have to assume that you have re-plugged to the same or similar 
target since the openocd cmd line pretty much specifies the target (in 
my case always stm32.cfg with 3 different boards that all work with that 
target file).

Once I put openocd to real use, the environment will be static (same 
board, same jtag adapter etc).
