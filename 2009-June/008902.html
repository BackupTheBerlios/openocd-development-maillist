Building both is actually a build system problem.  I believe the
automake documentation shows how to build a single source file using
different configuration options.... So, symbols similar to those you
show above would be defined as extra -D in the automake rules for the
targets.  I really think that this kind of rework should be fairly easy,
if time consuming to get exactly right.

Modular driver support _has_ been discussed in the past, to the extent
that it was put on the TODO list long ago. :)

Cheers,

Zach
