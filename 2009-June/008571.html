Actually, I did not claim here that I myself am being hurt, merely that
all of professional peers &quot;like me&quot; suffer from these exceptions because
they provide a disincentive for the community to demand open solutions.

But since you bring it up, sunk costs actually more relate to costs of
abandoning work that should have been profitable, because conditions
change that prevent the profit from being realized (or bigger profits
becoming available through other means).  Thus, my costs here will be
sunk if and only if I chose to depart from the community (or am exiled).

Since I did not mention my mortgage in this message, you are clearly
reading all messages and extrapolating beyond the words that you have on
the page in front of you.  Please allow for the fact that language is
not sufficiently precise to allow such extrapolations to be accurate.

I _expect_ others to profit from my work -- under the terms of the GPL.
The GPL has been established to have been the only and exclusive license
of the OpenOCD project, because the exceptions were never written down!
As you agreed, I have enough standing to take this as far as required in
an attempt to enforce this interpretation, whether or not I win.  Thus,
my opinion needs to matter for that reason alone, because I am not
simply treading water in legal waters: I think my boat floats.

I have offered my services repeatedly to those who need it to help
resolve this situation with technical solutions.  Instead, I am being
asked to give up my GPL copyright claims on the work that I have done,
without any compensation.  Are you kidding me?  Under what obligation am
I required to help others that project from violating the GPL license?

Cheers,

Zach
