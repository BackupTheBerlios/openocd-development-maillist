That doesn't address code from other sources (RedHat, FSF, etc)
that merged ... and which was published under straight GNU GPLv2.

Nor does it address the fact that the license explicitly DISallows
that use *FOR DISTRIBUTORS* at this time.  Recall that the initial
code was for a diploma thesis, not for distribution.

Or the fact that whatever the intent might once have seemed to be,
the only legal agreement is saying &quot;distributors may not do that&quot;.


&gt;<i> And subsequent

No, it's extremely easily defensible.  They saw the license was
GNU GPLv2, and they knew just what that means.  It's hardly news
to anyone ever looks at licenses.  There would be no &quot;retroactive
revocation&quot; going on, to just acknowledge reality by updating the
docs so they don't suggest distributors may violate that license.
(Any distributor with a brain already knew not to do that, but
that doesn't mean anyone should encourage such violations.)

This isn't even what I'd call &quot;fine print&quot; in the legal language.
It's one of the most distinguishing features of the GPL.

Don't forget that the issue isn't having a &quot;you may optionally
use &lt;closed source library/&gt; in personal builds&quot; option.

The issue is simply whether someone *DISTRIBUTING* binaries is
allowed to rely on that library.  And permission for that has
never been granted, through the license, by any contributor.
