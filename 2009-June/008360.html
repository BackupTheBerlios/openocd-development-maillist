</I>&gt;<i> As I understand (and Laurent or Dominic can confirm) Domenic worked with

The problem with your argument is that the license in the tree is GPL;
the license in all of the source code headers is GPL.  There are no
exceptions stated anywhere in the tree.  Consequently, this demonstrates
that my contributions were made under the GPL without any exceptions,
and I imagine that I am not the only contributor to have come to this
particular conclusion based on these same facts.  I am afraid that your
intent will not matter even one iota, in a court of law.

If you want to make exceptions, then they do not apply to the new code.
You cannot retroactively change the license; however, you are free to
fork the code at a point prior to my having a claim on the copyrights,
and make an exception there.  Since said license will not be compatible
with the GPL anymore, you may not use the changes that I contributed.

However, this further presumes that I am the only one that will object
to such a change.  That may not be the case, and I hope that others
authors that share my views will step forward to confirm this point.

Cheers,

Zach
