Hmm, having them be the same is the convention that's encouraged
already, as well as being the one used in every target/*.cfg
script I've looked at.  And I just grepped ... all the current
&quot;target create&quot; commands use $_TARGETNAME for both the target and
TAP names.

Notice how the &quot;targets&quot; command shows two names, normally the same.
If it's confusing (and I wouldn't agree that it is), it's not a new
type of confusion.  And I would argue that having more than one
namespace is itself very confusing... particularly since the
current policy more or less hides one of the namespaces.


&gt;<i> 					If you make &#160;
</I>&gt;<i> the names the same, people get confused when the $(target name) &#160;
</I>&gt;<i> command isn't available but the TAP has been created.
</I>
People are always free to be foolish.  If &quot;targets&quot; doesn't list
the name, there is no target.  TAP != target except on very simple
systems.

Although ... this reminds me how the &quot;scan_chain&quot; command is
buried so deeply in the user's guide.  I'll send a patch to
present it when scan chains are presented ... which will help
better distinguish the &quot;list of TAPs&quot; and &quot;list of targets&quot;
concepts, by properly presenting both of them.  (Though it'd
be nice to have tap-list primitives like we have target-list
primitives...)


&gt;<i> &gt;							Which just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; points out another conceptual problem ... either (a) &quot;target create&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should force target and TAP names to be the same (so &quot;-chain-position&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; becomes redundant), *or* (b) we need a &quot;list enabled taps&quot; primitive.
</I>
Minor nit:  I should have written &quot;mechanism&quot; not primitive.

And part of why I think that (a) is preferable is that it would let
us avoid creating parallel &quot;$target_name tapisenabled&quot; predicates
to match the already-working &quot;jtag tapisenabled $tap_name&quot; one.

Another is to avoid the nastiness inherent in the current capability
of running &quot;target configure -chain-position foo.bar&quot; *after* the
target has been set up.  I can't ever see goodness coming from that...

That is, it would help keep the layer distinction:  there's a TAP
layer, and a target layer.  TAP operations don't work on targets,
and vice versa.

(Some TAPs are isomorphic to targets too, and in the simplest systems
there may be only one tap == a target.)
