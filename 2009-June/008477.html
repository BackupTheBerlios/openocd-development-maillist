</I>Yes, you are. OpenOCD has been GPLv2 from the beginning, so there is no 
change. If you want to distribute binaries linked against D2XX, you are 
asking us to break the license, and multiple developers have clearly 
stated that such is not an acceptable options, so stop asking for it.

</I>It may have been a blunder, but it is too late to change the license 
now, except by getting approval from *all* copyright holders, and some 
have already stated they will NAK such a change.

</I>You are the first to tell so.
In that case, you are free to contribute code that uses the driver 
without linking against the troublesome (in terms of licensing) library.

The reason for &quot;not to use it&quot; is simply that the licensing terms of the 
library are not compatible with OpenOCD. That is a show-stopper for 
anyone who wants to distribute compiled binaries. The developers do not 
stop you from using the library - all the code is there in the sources, 
you just have to build them yourself.
