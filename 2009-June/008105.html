<PRE>At this time openocd is working quite well for me with 3 different jtag 
adapters: rlink, jlink and olimex/ftdi. However, I have noticed a couple 
of error recovery situations where it could get confusing for a user 
(probably me). Possibly this has been discussed before but a quick look 
at the maillist subjects didn't reveal anything.

1. If the user is not connected to the adapter via usb when openocd is 
started you see:

Error: unable to open ftdi device: device not found

and openocd terminates.

I guess you could put ./openocd in a script to retry with some delay. 
But maybe openocd could delay and retry on its own if &quot;device not found&quot; 
at start up?

2. With openocd correctly running and connected, if the jtag is 
disconnected I see a continuous stream of &quot;usb bulk write failed&quot; 
messages. Reconnecting the cable does not fix the situation and the 
errors keep coming. The only way to recover is to kill openocd and 
restart it.

These aren't big problems for me now, but I would prefer to have openocd 
running as a background daemon/service, out of sight/out of mind, that 
just recovers on its own when I do the wrong thing.

Have these scenarios been considered? Maybe I am missing something obvious?

Thanks,
-gene
