openocd will continue to support linking against the D2XX library, and 
such binaries may not be distributed - that is mandated by the current 
licence, and it is at it is, like it or not.

Discussions asking the developers to break their own license are not 
useful, and requests to do so will not increase the will to provide a 
real solution.

All these &quot;let's just ignore the GPL, or assume that an exception was 
there, even if we could not see it&quot; discussions have made me realize 
that I am now not very keen on allowing a license change.

&gt;<i> 1) Don't break other tools that do use D2XX for the same JTAG hardware
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Allow channel B to be used as a standard COM port
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Ensure performance must be at least as good
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you can't do all of the above, you'll kill OpenOCD for use on
</I>&gt;<i> Windows.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>You are free to contribute to make openocd more useful for Windows 
users. Putting up demands without an offer to bring those goals closer 
does not work in an open-source project.
&gt;<i> Personally, I would pursue options for keeping things the way they are.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Fine. The way things are is that no binary linked against the D2XX 
library may be distributed, so there is no change on the status quo.

&gt;<i> A couple of observations lead me to think that FTDI intend their D2XX
</I>&gt;<i> driver to be used by anyone using products with their devices in:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) The driver is publicly available *and* advertised... with example
</I>&gt;<i> projects!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) A statement:
</I>&gt;<i>    &quot;The driver may be distributed in any form as long as our license
</I>&gt;<i> information is not modified.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>The driver is not the problem, the library is. And as long as the 
library 's license makes any kind of additional restriction, I believe 
it is not compatible with the GPL - but IANAL.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've found FTDI very helpful in the past so I've e-mailed them to ask
</I>&gt;<i> for their stance on this. As a British company, we should expect sanity
</I>&gt;<i> to prevail. In the mean time, how about a 'make' option for those of a
</I>&gt;<i> nervous disposition, to avoid linking with FTDI's import library:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   make --enable-paranoid-mode
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>We do have those - you can specify what kind of library/backend to use 
during configure (--enable-xxx)
