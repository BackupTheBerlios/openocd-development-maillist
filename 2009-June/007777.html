And some earlier ARMs do strange things in idle states too.

ISTR that &quot;wait for interrupt&quot; (WFI) instructions may need
special treatment with emulators in use; haven't had much
need to look at it myself, before now.


&gt;<i> Such devices may have the TAP enabled, but the target &#160;

I think those are somewhat orthogonal issues though.

Power gating is through a separate control framework,
which one hopes is accessible without the CPU ... that
seems to have been an 1149.7 goal (class T1 has power
states), also something of a Nexus goal (in the sense
that there seem to be bus access primitives that don't
go through the CPU, I recall it as a separate TAP).

Clock gating for ARM cores is coupled to stuff like
the WFI instruction, but once the core is in a real
debug mode at least some of them use that trick of
having TCK drive the pipeline at &quot;debug speed&quot;.

At any rate ... we agree that &quot;curstate&quot; is a trifle
weak as models go.


&gt;<i> &gt; The IEEE 1149.7 stuff seems to incorporate a &quot;tap state&quot; model of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sorts ... parts relevant to OpenOCD would be the power states, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whether it's routed into the scan chain or not. &#160;I'd say those use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cases are relatively &quot;near future&quot;. &#160;Not so with &quot;target state&quot;.
</I>
