Why did you move the declarations of jtag_tap_{init,free} to the bottom
of jtag.h?  If anything, they should appear near the other jtag_tap_*
routine declarations, but I put them in tcl.c because I think they might
be better wrapped by higher-level TAP APIs such as jtag_tap_create and
jtag_tap_destroy (which exist -- in monolithic form -- inside the JTAG
TCL routines, FWIW).  I didn't get that far; the amount of factoring
that could be done is rather overwhelming.

Also, would it be too much to ask to separate your changes into slightly
smaller pieces?  Personally, I have been trying to lean towards
bite-sized patches as we move toward 0.2.0; this one chews on few pieces
at once.  While the changes look correct, I have been trying to maximize
the ability for others to spot regressions through bisection.  

Plus, you will motivate me to finish the &quot;import series from e-mail&quot;
portions of my patch handling scripts, if you start producing series of
patches with a dozen patches each.  Or do you think my recent practices
have taken this idea too far?

Cheers,

Zach
