Well, actually, that's not what it says.  The hardware may choose to  
_not_ use 0 as a null pointer.  The language, on the other hand,  
ensures that any compile-time 0's used in pointer contexts are  
translated to the appropriate hardware representation of a null  
pointer.  So NULL is always defined as 0, but only because a constant  
0 in a pointer context will always mean null pointer.  This is very  
important if you were, say, writing an interrupt vector table and had  
the entries typed as ints rather than pointers.  If you wrote 0 in  
that case, you are potentially defining a valid pointer.

That _only_ extends to compile-time though.  That means that any form  
of runtime conversions from integers to pointers (a bad idea anyway,  
but it happens) can potentially cause problems if the hardware doesn't  
use 0 as a null pointer.  Imagine an API that passes in data via  
int's.  The implementation of the API knows that one of those int's is  
really a pointer.  Since the compile-time version of the conversion is  
just a cast, it doesn't get any special treatment.  If you were  
attempting to do sanity checking on the pointer value, you would need  
to be careful.  If you test the int for 0, it will give the wrong  
answer on machines that use non-0 null pointers.  If you test the  
pointer, the constant 0 used in the test will be converted to the  
appropriate null pointer and all is well.

I'd say that using NULL is actually clearer than 0 in this case.  0 is  
relying on intimate knowledge of the language and its special handling  
of 0 in pointer contexts.  NULL, while always being defined as 0 or  
(void *)0, makes it clear that the end result is whatever the hardware  
needs for a null pointer.

Not that it actually makes any difference for 99.999% of us.

it with him.&quot;
