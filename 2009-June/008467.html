According to my overflowing inbox, this is very much in discussion.


&gt;<i> openocd will continue to support linking against the D2XX

</I>&gt;<i> mandated by the current licence, and it is at it is, like it or not.

</I>&gt;<i> Discussions asking the developers to break their own license 
</I>&gt;<i> are not useful, and requests to do so will not increase the 
</I>&gt;<i> will to provide a real solution.
</I>

I'm not asking you to break anything; I'm merely suggesting doing
nothing is an option worth considering. OpenOCD has been a very useful
project for many years exactly as it is.


&gt;<i> All these &quot;let's just ignore the GPL, or assume that an 
</I>&gt;<i> exception was there, even if we could not see it&quot; discussions 
</I>&gt;<i> have made me realize that I am now not very keen on allowing 
</I>&gt;<i> a license change.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) Don't break other tools that do use D2XX for the same 
</I>&gt;<i> JTAG hardware
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) Allow channel B to be used as a standard COM port
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) Ensure performance must be at least as good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you can't do all of the above, you'll kill OpenOCD for use on 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Windows.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> You are free to contribute to make openocd more useful for 
</I>&gt;<i> Windows users. Putting up demands without an offer to bring 
</I>&gt;<i> those goals closer does not work in an open-source project.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Personally, I would pursue options for keeping things the 
</I>&gt;<i> way they are.
</I>

Some might say arguing against a blunder is a useful contribution for
Windows users, like myself.


&gt;<i> Fine. The way things are is that no binary linked against the 
</I>&gt;<i> D2XX library may be distributed, so there is no change on the 
</I>&gt;<i> status quo.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A couple of observations lead me to think that FTDI intend 
</I>&gt;<i> their D2XX 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; driver to be used by anyone using products with their devices in:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) The driver is publicly available *and* advertised... 
</I>&gt;<i> with example 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; projects!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) A statement:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    &quot;The driver may be distributed in any form as long as 
</I>&gt;<i> our license 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information is not modified.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> The driver is not the problem, the library is. And as long as 
</I>&gt;<i> the library 's license makes any kind of additional 
</I>&gt;<i> restriction, I believe it is not compatible with the GPL - but IANAL.
</I>

The library merely provides a friendly API to the driver. You don't need
to link to the library in order to use the driver; it's a convenience
provided by the manufacturer for software developers like us... so why
find reasons not to use it.


&gt;<i> &gt; I've found FTDI very helpful in the past so I've e-mailed 
</I>&gt;<i> them to ask 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for their stance on this. As a British company, we should expect 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sanity to prevail. In the mean time, how about a 'make' option for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; those of a nervous disposition, to avoid linking with 
</I>&gt;<i> FTDI's import library:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   make --enable-paranoid-mode
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> We do have those - you can specify what kind of 
</I>&gt;<i> library/backend to use during configure (--enable-xxx)
</I>&gt;<i>
