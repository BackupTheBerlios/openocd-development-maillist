<PRE>Hi Pavel,

welcome back it's been a while! I hope that you'll stick around
to submit some more good patches. You've contributed lots of nice
stuff in the past!

GPL stops closed source target &amp; interface for OpenOCD.

That's one of the *main* reasons I got involved with OpenOCD in the first place.

I also knew that since the project was GPL to start with, it wouldn't
switch to another license once a sufficient # of contributors had signed
up. At least not without *everybody* agreeing to a license change. This
ensures that any license change won't be full of holes.

It would be absolutely hell to try come up with some sort of GPL with exception
that did not open up for closed source target/interface's. Personally I don't
think it can be done, LGPL isn't it and nothing else specifi has been suggested.

I *know* there are hardware vendors out there that
are aching to use OpenOCD together with closed source target support,
and they *would* find any tiny loophole and throw money at lawyers to
exploit it.

There are lots of closed source debug solutions out there for those
targets/interfaces that are not willing to open up. Good for 'em! That's
not what OpenOCD is about.

Now, I *know* you can fix these USB problems with both hands tied
behind your back in your sleep with a modest effort. The acceptable
solutions have been outlined. For sure it's a million times easier for
you to solve this technically than legally.

You stand out amongst the hardware vendors because you have made
*very* significant contributions in the past.

How about using the bitq stuff forl a generic JTAG over TCP/IP solution? ;-)


Giving up the most important line of defense against closed source
target &amp; interface support due to some silly little technical problem
can't possibly make any sense to you?
