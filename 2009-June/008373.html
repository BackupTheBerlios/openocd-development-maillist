Ooooh ... *MUCH* better!   Thank you!

No comments other than that, for now.


Except for:

&gt;<i> d) Improve libusb-win32, get the driver digital signed to solve the
</I>&gt;<i> 64bit Windows issues. Some HW vendors may be able to help.
</I>&gt;<i> They can even get their HW driver WHQLed with libusb-win32
</I>&gt;<i> as well. This may be outside the scope of OpenOCD community
</I>&gt;<i> but the community can play a part.

Vendors who are presenting OpenOCD as part of their
software solution *SHOULD* be helping out here, IMO.
Not only for the (d) option either...

They can't sell their hardware to Win64 users without
such options, right?  And even Win32 users need help...


Now, as to how that should be done ... this calls for
developers with enough tact to deal with vendors.  As
most of us know, such developers are not the most
common variety (sigh).  A second qualification is to
be relatively fluent in Windows development.

It's likely not a really-near-term thing, but folk
who can put OpenOCD developers in contact with the
right folk at hardware houses should do so (off line
of course).  The requirement isn't that OpenOCD folk
do the work (nice but not essential) ... it's that
it be done quickly on a not-very-big budget, and
get released to the community.

(Budget matters of course.  These FT2232 dongles
sell for US $50-$150 or so.  Not gobs of profit.
Payback would be in strengthened sales, and maybe
some positive press.)
