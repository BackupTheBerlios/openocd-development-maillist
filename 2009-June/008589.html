</I>
I would be deluded to believe that all of my time will be recovered
directly, unless I were to create a dongle or some other device that
leverages all of those hours and made profits that paid off all of these
investments ten times over.  I stand by my assertion that those costs
will not be &quot;sunk&quot; unless such plans fail to come through.

That said, I might be ambitious (or on the verge of delusion) to believe
that such could happen, so I will concede the point -- grudgingly --
that most of my time will probably end up sunk. ;)

&gt;<i> &gt; I _expect_ others to profit from my work -- under the terms of the  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GPL.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The GPL has been established to have been the only and exclusive  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; license
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the OpenOCD project, because the exceptions were never written  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; down!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've never contended that there was an exception, implied or  
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise.  I _do_ contend that &quot;I refuse to do anything but strictly  
</I>&gt;<i> enforce my view of the GPL&quot; does not extrapolate to the community  
</I>&gt;<i> being required to follow such a decision.  So next time you want to  
</I>&gt;<i> write that you won't agree to an alternate interpretation, realize  
</I>&gt;<i> that it ultimately doesn't matter.  Your work can be replaced and your  
</I>&gt;<i> copyrights in the project removed.  It is up to the community, not a  
</I>&gt;<i> single copyright holder, to decide.
</I>
The community is free to make the decision, true enough.  That would be
entertaining too.  Sad, but amusing.

&gt;<i> &gt; As you agreed, I have enough standing to take this as far as  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; required in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an attempt to enforce this interpretation, whether or not I win.   
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thus,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; my opinion needs to matter for that reason alone, because I am not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; simply treading water in legal waters: I think my boat floats.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You certainly can, but the community can also decide to remove your  
</I>&gt;<i> copyrights from the project and do whatever they want.  At that point,  
</I>&gt;<i> you have no legal recourse on future distributions.
</I>
True.  Is this where you are leaning, personally?

&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have offered my services repeatedly to those who need it to help
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; resolve this situation with technical solutions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With lots of grandstanding about ensuring those solutions will also be  
</I>&gt;<i> covered by the GPL even if there is no strict reason that they must.
</I>
Please explain this further, particularly the part about &quot;even if there
is no strict reason that they must&quot;.  I cannot imagine that you are
suggesting violating the GPL, so this does not parse for me right now.

I am willing to build GPL-compatible solutions, while others would
rather try to work around the GPL.  Fixing the open solution is easier
than trying to change the license, and it's cheaper than paying lawyers.

I do not want to give my work under a license that lets others get the
work for free, because it is fair for me to try to make a little money
for the effort it will take.  Otherwise, what is wrong with the GPL for
a reference implementation?  Did you even read the part of the other
e-mail where I said the door for proprietary work will be open no matter
what license OpenOCD chooses in this capacity?  And that I would be
willing to dual-license said work?  What is wrong about any of this?

&gt;<i> &gt;  Instead, I am being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; asked to give up my GPL copyright claims on the work that I have done,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without any compensation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No one has asked that at all.  Rather, there has been requests to  
</I>&gt;<i> discuss alternatives to the few Zach sanctioned technical solutions.   
</I>&gt;<i> You don't need to participate in them, but you should recognize that  
</I>&gt;<i> other copyright holders have the right to discuss alternatives even if  
</I>&gt;<i> they don't align with your wishes.
</I>
By asking to add an exception to the license, that is exactly what is
happening here, unless you would like to remove my changes -- as you
have repeated pointed out is possible.  Your repetition of this gives me
concern that you would consider such an option as appealing.

&gt;<i> &gt;  Are you kidding me?  Under what obligation am
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I required to help others that project from violating the GPL license?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> None and no one has asked you to.  There has been no clear resolution  
</I>&gt;<i> either way.  You have expressed your dissent.  Should the community  
</I>&gt;<i> decide to do a 0.2.0 release in such a way that violates the GPL and  
</I>&gt;<i> contains your copyrighted code, you have the ability to assert your  
</I>&gt;<i> rights via the legal system.
</I>
I have been cajoled and ridiculed for taking my present stance.  I have
been seeing a wide range of pressures from users and contributors to
give the community an exception for this library.  I reject your
assertion that no one has asked me; I claim that every new request asks
the same question of me anew.  I am very sensitive to the needs of the
community, regardless of what you may want to say to the contrary.  

However, I would be screwing a much bigger community than OpenOCD if I
were to allow an exception to the GPL.  I would be undermining the
broader free software community.  I can't live with that.  Can you?
When there are now abundance of compliant technical solutions?

I said in another thread that I now see this as a &quot;blocker&quot; for 0.2.0.
OpenOCD needs to provide a GPL-compliant solution for these users before
anyone produces more binary releases from the trunk w/ FTD2XX.  Each
individual distributor can decide for themselves whether or not I have
the passion and ability to pursue violators to seek such compliance.

Cheers,

Zach
