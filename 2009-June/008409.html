Thank you for providing clarification of your original intention;
however, you have only confirmed what was already clear: there has never
been a formal exception to the GPL.  Any arrangements were made
informally and without modifying the GPL license itself.  Even if your
exception was published in a public forum, you will have a difficult
time defending that it applies -- since the license was never modified
in the tree.

&#216;yvind Harboe, David Brownell, and myself are against any exceptions, so
there can be no exception added to the license for the contributions
that we have made.  Your clarification appears to have no legal bearing
on license for the current trunk: OpenOCD is pure GPL, and it always has
been since it was created.

&gt;<i> &#216;yvind mentioned the idea of wrapping the JTAG API in TCP/IP. Aside
</I>&gt;<i> from performance implications I think this would require some
</I>&gt;<i> significant development efforts with little immediate benefits. Even
</I>&gt;<i> worse, it would encourage other JTAG interface vendors to implement
</I>&gt;<i> their JTAG interface layer as a binary only driver that talks to the
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD via TCP/IP layer, too.
</I>
I am opposed to this as well, for the same reasons.  This is why I did
not suggest it until someone else suggested it.  I want to see libusb
and libfdti fixed, and I do not want to open the door to more binary
drivers.  If I were to implement the TCP/IP interface without pay, I
would release it under the GPL to prevent this situation from ever
occurring.  At this point, I am tempted to implement it simply in order
to close this back door to binary drivers.

Cheers,

Zach
