</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore the 2nd best solution for Windows user may be to get a

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After that, the solution will be to use WinUSB (or libusb-win32 1.0 if it can

IMHO, this makes any solution NOT based on FTD2xx unacceptable. People
will not be willing to give up all their other tooling to run OpenOCD,
instead they might find other solutions and stop using OpenOCD. I
haven't read all the mails related to this issue, but this is new
information for me at the moment. I'm not going to repeat my
interpretation of GPL, you'll have to read up one of my other replies
for the details, but looking at all the disadvantages of any other
solution/workaround I really hope we can agree to allow distribution of
FTD2xx based binaries for Windows.

I agree that a GPL-compatible re-implementation is a valid solution, but
really, who is going to make and more importantly maintain that? You
have to test compatibility with a lot of other applications and that
will cost valuable time that is better spend on improving OpenOCD. Don't
underestimate the maintenance of such a driver. What if FTDI adds a
feature to it's DLL? Will we reverse engineer everything and keep in
sync? What's an acceptable delay to update the GPL FTD2xx version to
include these updates? And there's still the WHQL thing outlined above.
All messy and stressful if you ask me.

I would still require the LoadLibrary patches to make OpenOCD run even
if FTD2xx is not installed. Again, FTD2xx is NOT a derived work of
OpenOCD so it doesn't need to be GPL'd. Adding FTD2xx support does NOT
open any doors to closed source interfaces (and note that in the spirit
of GPL I am against closed source interfaces).

So: Who exactly is against FTD2xx based binary distributions of OpenOCD
and in the face of all these downsides, isn't there anything we can do
to convince you otherwise?
