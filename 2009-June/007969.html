That wasn't meant as a ding; just a &quot;WTF is he talking about??
I've seen no such patch series.  Maybe it's &lt;this&gt; ...&quot;


&gt;<i> The openocd-svn list provides ongoing notification of the changes.
</I>&gt;<i> Posting direct commits here seems redundant to me. &#160;Heck, I think that
</I>&gt;<i> even the &quot;committed&quot; messages are pedantic for this same reason, but I

</I>&gt;<i> been committed, you can use 'svn log' or subscribe to that mailing list.
</I>
Hmm, we seem to have a style issue here.  I'm one of the many
folk who's not interested in getting extra email about commits,
and so *never* subscribes to such mailing lists.

And that's in part because I'm used to seeing patches circulated
before they get committed.  So the &quot;committed...&quot; messages are
just closing the discuss/review/.../commit loop.  They aren't
the first public visibility that something's being considered,
or done.

I suspect that's going to keep tripping me (and others) up with
the OpenOCD work, since the model seems to be that folk with commit
access will just commit, sans discussion/notice.


&gt;<i> I committed these changes directly because they have not included any
</I>&gt;<i> apparent functional changes.
</I>
I'd agree.  But:  &quot;apparent&quot; is a key word.  Most developers have
seen many cases where changes crept in that were not-apparent...


&gt;<i> There have been very few reports of regressions after two weeks of my
</I>&gt;<i> heavy patching, and I imagine that it has not been for lack of looking
</I>&gt;<i> on the part of other maintainers and contributors -- if only to call me
</I>&gt;<i> out in a similar fashion. &#160;The complete lack of community discouragement
</I>&gt;<i> has been interpreted as ongoing success and reason to continue unabated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your sentiment is the first to indicate a clearly contrary opinion.
</I>
No it isn't.  It's the first recent remark that there's lots of
source code updating that's not visible on the developer list,
that's all.


&gt;<i> I have a couple of dozen meta-patches prepared to clean up most of the
</I>&gt;<i> remaining whitespace and core type issues in the tree. &#160;I also would
</I>&gt;<i> like to create another series of patches to address the dozens of API
</I>&gt;<i> naming issues and other remaining mechanically resolvable problems. 
</I>
I like to see releases go out with cleanup fixes included, so long as
it's known they're safe.  If there's a release target of &quot;end of this
month&quot;, those are starting to cut things close...

(Reason for *releases* in particular to get late-in-cycle mostly-cosmetic
fixups, even if they're biggish changes, is that it's the best time to
get them in.  Folk who look at the release code, and patch it, have a
lot better starting point than they would if such fixes went into the
next release cycle.  And developers should be chasing/fixing smaller
and smaller bugs, so such changes are easier to cope with at that time
than they would be later on.  Assuming they *are* cosmetic...)


&gt;<i> Another valgrind-exposed &quot;fix&quot; to clear all allocated register buffers
</I>&gt;<i> negatively affects performance, though I implemented it such that it can
</I>&gt;<i> be optimized away for release. &#160;I expect all such changes to be resisted
</I>&gt;<i> due to its impact on the tree or build, but -- let me be clear -- I
</I>&gt;<i> would never commit such patches without the community's consideration.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Those things deserve review and comments -- not mundane clean-up. &#160;While
</I>&gt;<i> my recent efforts have started to take out some of the trash, the amount
</I>&gt;<i> of work that remains to be done daunts me, and I think literally
</I>&gt;<i> hundreds of patches will be required to address all of the issues in the
</I>&gt;<i> incremental fashion that I have been taking. &#160;I am not exaggerating.
</I>
Yes, risky changes need more care and attention.  Splitting them up
into lots of &quot;obviously correct&quot; stages is part of reducing risk.

But cleanup also deserves some notice (and for that matter, credit) too.


&gt;<i> Altogether, your reply has drained my enthusiasm to continue with this
</I>&gt;<i> line of work; I must assume that others share your sentiment but have
</I>&gt;<i> not said anything.
</I>
As you suspected, you're being hypersensitive.  That's neither what
I said nor what I meant.
