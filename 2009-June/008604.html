</I>&gt;<i> It is not crap! If you deviate from a contract long enough then those

</I>
This is not land.  You can't stake a claim.  The GPL has been in the
repository since the very beginning, without an exception.  It has been
posted &quot;no trespassing&quot; since day one.

&gt;<i> &gt; I am really getting frustrated by the claim that &quot;everyone knew&quot; about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the exception.  I most certainly did not, and you will have an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; impossible case proving that I accepted these terms in face of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in-tree copy of the unadulterated GPL.  Those are the terms I
</I>&gt;<i> accepted,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without any exceptions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Skeleton in the closet. Nothing to be done about that. You think you
</I>&gt;<i> accepted the GPL terms, but you also accepted the exception. There is
</I>&gt;<i> enough evidence that the exception existed when you started working on
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD. 'I didn't know' and 'If I knew before' don't work in court.
</I>
You are opening some seriously unpleasant areas of legal exploration.

You have made me start to wonder if it would be possible to bring some
sort of claim of &quot;misrepresentation&quot; against the project authors, were
your suggestion to be taken by others.  The COPYING file is the standard
way of notifying potential authors of a project's license, so I think
that I would have a good chance of proving that the authors neglected to
inform authors -- whether by intention or accident.

Either way, this demonstrates rather clear negligence on the part of the
authors, which I believe will defeat your claims.  Do you want to keep
going down this road?  There are more doors that probably remain to be
opened, and we can explore them all if you insist.

Personally, I want to be done with talking about these matters and start
to move on to fix the problems for the community.  Sound good?

Cheers,

Zach
