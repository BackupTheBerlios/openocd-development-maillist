I think leaving out the parentheses is perfectly OK in this case, but 
the conditions might be rearranged (invert &amp; exit, split into two 
separate tests) to make the code easier to understand.

&gt;<i> - If you are testing that a variable is non-NULL, write that.  
</I>&gt;<i> Similarly for a test for NULL.  Taking the short-cut just makes it 
</I>&gt;<i> less clear what you are doing and why.  Besides, it isn't necessarily 
</I>&gt;<i> guaranteed that NULL will always be 0. ;)
</I>NULL is for pointers, nothing else. If you want to test if something is 
zero, write &quot;0&quot;.
IMHO, even in pointer context, &quot;0&quot; should be used - &quot;NULL&quot; provides no 
extra function except hiding what happens, and using if (pointer == 0) 
instead of if (pointer) is no improvement at all.

And yes, it *is* guaranteed that NULL is 0, see:
