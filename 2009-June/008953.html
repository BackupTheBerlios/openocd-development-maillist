<PRE>Zack,

Thanks for all this info,

As far is I can see the link to spark fun on instructions to build your
own is
<A HREF="http://forum.sparkfun.com/viewtopic.php?t=11221">http://forum.sparkfun.com/viewtopic.php?t=11221</A>

I may give it a try.

As far as:
===============================================
We cannot &quot;build a binary with FTD2XX support for you&quot; because
distributing it to you would violate the GPL (because that library is
closed source).  Someone could build a binary with libftdi support,
because that library is open source and compatible with the distribution
terms of the GPL.  The details are gory, but that's it in a nutshell.
I would suggest reading the COPYING file through; it is enlightening
=============================== is concerned:

FTDI is a chip company correct ?, I believe,  openOCD  consortium or
whatever it is
you guys call yourself have reasons why they must keep to the GPL terms,
Which you
could explain to me if you want, but for end users like me, I could on my
own take
your open source code and  link to FTDI's  library, and FTDI would not sue
me
or my company , as long  as I am not selling some kind of debugger that has
their code in it. Is this correct ?? It is not like the library is pirated
or somthing, right ?
Perhaps I could find the latest FTDI library on thier web site ?

Best regards,

Joe

</I>&gt;<i> They have some responsibility for providing support for their product;
</I>&gt;<i> however, the OpenOCD community does not.  Still, you will probably find
</I>&gt;<i> us more responsive and pro-active, though I could be wrong on this. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is there a tutorial on building openOCD myself ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe one has been posted on the SparkFun forum, though I have

</I>&gt;<i> Please let me know if you find instructions that work for you, or

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Finally is it a known fact that Luminary parts do not work for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; breakpoints and some new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; version that you have will fix my problem ?? I do not  want to build
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unless
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it will provide a fix for my problems. Or ??
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I cannot say.  You probably need to try it and report your findings.
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, the initial hurdle of compiling it will position you to
</I>&gt;<i> keep up with any changes that do fix that problem (or others).
