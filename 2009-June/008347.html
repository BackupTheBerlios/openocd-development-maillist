&gt;<i> As no satisfying solution has been decided I will try to summarise the 
</I>&gt;<i> options I think are fine for Windows users. Please - put away your 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;linux &gt;&gt; windows&quot; attitude aside for a moment and do keep in mind three 
</I>&gt;<i> things before proceeding:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Windows users usually have no knowledgle of linux and linux tools
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Windows users expect a software package to work &quot;out of the box&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Windows users are not familiar with open-source and GPL ideas
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Because of 1. a solution with VM running OpenOCD on linux is bad, 
</I>&gt;<i> because instead of questions &quot;how to use libftdi version&quot; we will be 
</I>&gt;<i> flooded with &quot;how to use linux VM version&quot;. Because of 1. it is naive to 
</I>&gt;<i> expect more than 1% Windows user to be able to compile OpenOCD for 
</I>&gt;<i> private use. Becaue of 1. it is not a solution to distribute a VM with 
</I>&gt;<i> linux crosscompiler and apropriate scripts. Because of 2. it is bad to 
</I>&gt;<i> ship OpenOCD with libftdi which expects user to create custom drivers 
</I>&gt;<i> (there are NO libusb drivers for FT2232 posted on vendor's websites), 
</I>&gt;<i> download a hacked version of libusb0.sys and overwrite the original and 
</I>&gt;<i> so on... Because of 3. Windows users see nothing wrong in using a freely 
</I>&gt;<i> aviable ftd2xx library that is faster and supports virtual COM ports.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So in reality I see only two solutions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. A ftd2xx.dll wrapper library, which would be published under GPL with 
</I>&gt;<i> exception for ftd2xx.dll. Such library would dynamically link ftd2xx and 
</I>&gt;<i> - as an open-source solution - could be linked with OpenOCD. This is a 
</I>&gt;<i> very good proposal made by Herald Kipp and described in detail here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2009-June/008265.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2009-June/008265.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. A binary patch which would &quot;convert&quot; a libusb+libftdi based 
</I>&gt;<i> executable to ftd2xx based one. Me and Michael Fisher managed to produce 
</I>&gt;<i>   such patch with bsdiff/bspatch. The patch is 30kB in size and works.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, it's obvious that option 1 requires some work. The library has to 
</I>&gt;<i> be created and OpenOCD code has to be modified to work with that. As the 
</I>&gt;<i> libary would be a &quot;wrapper&quot; the change in OpenOCD would be merely a name 
</I>&gt;<i> replacement &quot;FT_...&quot; =&gt; &quot;OpenFT_...&quot; (or whatever name would be chosen). 
</I>&gt;<i> Before such work can be started it would be nice for anybody to comment 
</I>&gt;<i> on what Herald wrote in the post I linked above. I took some time 
</I>&gt;<i> yesterday to browse gnu.org website and I think that this solution would 
</I>&gt;<i> not violate GPL.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Moreover - _maybe_ such library could also provide a method to &quot;switch&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> ftd2xx to libftdi so that it would be up to user to decide what he/she 
</I>&gt;<i> wishes to use (libftdi and ftd2xx are more or less compatible). This way 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD would not require a decision of library at compile time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The most obvious problem with that solution is that it requires time and 
</I>&gt;<i> this would not be finished until 0.2.0 (which I hope is coming soon). 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe even a bigger problem is your attitude towards such solution...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The second solution can be used right away. Nothing needs to be changed. 
</I>&gt;<i>   The major concern is - will you allow a patch, patch tool and 
</I>&gt;<i> instructions to use that to be included in the installer in a folder 
</I>&gt;<i> named - for example - &quot;Non-GPL&quot;? (I'm asking this for the third time and 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd really like to hear the answer).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some will say that there is a third solution - improve libftdi and 
</I>&gt;<i> libusb to work as good ad ftd2xx. That solution is very GPL friendly, 
</I>&gt;<i> but... I think I would be able to create a &quot;wrapper library&quot; with some 
</I>&gt;<i> (a lot [; ) help, but improving libusb and libftdi code is way beyond my 
</I>&gt;<i> capabilities. I also haven't seen any volunteers that could do that job. 
</I>&gt;<i>   That's why I suggest to first use the &quot;patch&quot; solution, than &quot;wrapper 
</I>&gt;<i> library&quot; while waiting for libftdi/libusb improvements, because these 
</I>&gt;<i> may be complete in a month, in a year or in ten years...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Currently There are many arguments against libftdi and libusb on 
</I>&gt;<i> windows, most important of them:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. speed,
</I>&gt;<i> 2. no support for serial ports on the second channel,
</I>&gt;<i> 3. lack of vendor provided drivers online,
</I>&gt;<i> 4. no support for composite devices in published libusb code (need for 
</I>&gt;<i> hacked libusb0.sys).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's why I think that without a good solution OpenOCD is more or less 
</I>&gt;<i> dead for most of Windows users. So please - put at least half of &quot;spaces 
</I>&gt;<i> vs. tabs&quot; energy in this discussion. This way we can find a solution 
</I>&gt;<i> that is satisfactory for both parties, because now it's a win-lose in 
</I>&gt;<i> GPL vs. windows users.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or maybe you just wish to ignore Windows and it's n00b users - if that's 
</I>&gt;<i> the case, state that out loud, and we will be gone and stop bothering 
</I>&gt;<i> you with our problems.
</I>
Please DO NOT try to cheat the GPL license.  You do not understand how
far I am willing to take these matters, and I believe any form of binary
distribution to be a violation: a DLL wrapper, a binary patch, anything!

Fix the problems with libusb and libfdti.  Period.

Cheers,

Zach
