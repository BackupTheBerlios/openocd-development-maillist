Here's a start.  Maybe other folk can add more.  From the docs
I have, I don't think Beagle actually needed standalone &quot;endstate&quot;
since it was sufficient to require that the scan ops finish in a
PAUSE state.

I was doing this on a DaVinci, which AFAIK was the first product
to use ICEpick-C.  That should be simpler than on OMAP3, where
issues like &quot;we don't yet have full Cortex-A8 support&quot; also crop
up.  Plus, there's boot mode where ICEpick configuration is not
needed ... which also helps isolate issues.

I'm going by this PDF document (rev 0.2 just now):

  <A HREF="http://tiexpressdsp.com/images/3/3c/Router_Scan_Sequence.pdf">http://tiexpressdsp.com/images/3/3c/Router_Scan_Sequence.pdf</A>

See the appended &quot;icepick.tcl&quot; script, which should eventually
become sharable/library code.

In no particular order, and with no expectation of completeness:

 - Can't handle IDCODE instruction for these DSPs, since the
   instruction length is 38 bits.  Affects testing; I don't
   expect OpenOCD to ever support C55, C64x+, or C67+ DSPs!
   (I want to be able to look at *every* JRC port, to know
   that the code behaves in more than one single case.)

 - The current *model* of TAP enable/disable is a bit off.

     *	There are two disable modes, but the code only has
	one right now.  We should interpret the &quot;-disable&quot;
	option on TAP creation to reflect the state after
	exit from the JTAG Test_Logic_Reset state (doc fix
	for 0.2 IMO).  The *desired runtime state* is a
	different beast, AFAICT.

     *	Related, enabling TAPs is currently only done by
	a &quot;jtag tapenable $TAP&quot; command.  It should be
	abstracted so it's done automatically in cases like
	initializing an ETM bound to a disabled ETB, and
	to re-enable after some code triggered TLR.

 - The current TAP enable code is incomplete.  It needs to
   kick the target(s) asociated with that TAP; examine()
   it and maybe more.

 - That TAP enable code is also excessively trusting.  It
   should verify that the TAP actually appears!  And that
   it's the expected device.   The latter implies different
   kind of chain validation than we have now, since it may
   not enter TLR.  (Presumably we can immediately verify
   the IR length with IRSCAN.  Though it'd be good to sanity
   check that we didn't somehow enable *two* adjacent taps.
   If we know the IDCODE opcode we should then be able to
   verify the expected TAP id.)

 - Similarly with TAP disable.  It should verify that the
   TAP disappeared.  (We don't currently know how to make
   the ICEpick-C taps go away, but I'm fairly sure we could
   find out ... even without a logic analyser watching what
   happens on the JTAG bus!)

 - I didn't see an obvious way to guarantee the expected
   100+ TCK cycles after TLR.  The cleanest way would be
   to define a new TAP event for TLR exit, and let the
   JRC provide a method that just does &quot;runtest 100&quot;.

 - One of the header files says that interfaces may use
   arbitrary state transitions.  I think that's got to
   be changed somewhat ... the new &quot;pathmove&quot; thing is
   not sufficient, given free running clocks.  The hard
   and fast rule *here* must be:  never enter RUN/IDLE
   implicitly.

 - Server can come up with the &quot;current&quot; target disabled.
   That shouldn't be possible.

That's all for now.  Comments from anyone who's looked
at this before?

- Dave

       drscan $jrc 32 [expr 0xa0002108 + ($port &lt;&lt; 24)] -endstate DRPAUSE
       irscan $jrc 0x3F -endstate RUN/IDLE
