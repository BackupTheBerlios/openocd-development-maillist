<PRE>(Lots of stuff deleted from your mail. Nothing is intended
by that other than that I couldn't really think of a reply.)



&gt;<i> Can you please stop talking in riddles and just write what you want to say?
</I>
Am I always talking in riddles or just this once?

&gt;<i> This change is absolutely not a breach of GPL, it has totally nothing to do
</I>&gt;<i> with GPL, it's just a way to make one binary work with Interface X if
</I>&gt;<i> available, and not crash if not.
</I>
I don't know the details of the approach being discussed, but there were snide
remarks about OpenOCD maintainers refusing to commit stuff, so I thought
I'd say something about what would get committed or not and what it would
mean that something got committed or not.

I believe Harald would have spoken up if the current approach being discussed
was not in GPL compliance(or was a transparent attempt at circumventing it),
but I haven't looked into the details.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I totally can't follow anymore, but are you one of the GPL purists?
</I>
I don't know what a GPL purist is, so I couldn't possibly tell.

I'm interested in a watertight scheme, legally and practically,
to ensure open source target support.

I do *lots* of closed source development. It's what puts bread on the
table really, so I don't do GPL exclusively.

&gt;<i> I've seen your name pass by a lot on this list, so I'm quite
</I>&gt;<i> sure you know what OpenOCD source looks like.
</I>
Thanks!

I've committed &gt;500(I've stopped counting) or so changes of my
own to OpenOCD + hundres of others.

I've been around the code a few times.

&gt;<i>  And please, what  are you so afraid off? What commercial reason is driving you?
</I>
Iron clad guarantees that we don't create loopholes for closed source
target support.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, what makes you or Zach decide what's acceptable and not anyone else on
</I>&gt;<i> this list?
</I>
The GPL license explains what's acceptable or not, Zach, you or me have
no influence on the matter.
