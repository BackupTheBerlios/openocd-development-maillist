In your personal mailbox or from the list?  I certainly hope not the  
latter.  There were at least 3 separate threads going and it was  
getting difficult to keep track of what options were reasonable/valid/ 
popular.  I highly doubt the intent was solely to defeat the GPL, but  
rather to provide an option that doesn't create undue hardship for  
either users or developers.  Not everyone is an expert on the GPL and  
so those who understand why a given option can't be used to comply  
with the GPL should explain those reasons to those suggesting the  
option.

While I understand the difficulties in resolving this problem, there  
has been a prevailing feeling that the few staunch GPL supporters have  
been quick to say No to options without explaining in full _why_ it  
won't work.  I've felt that the GPL supporters have even acted with  
hostility to anyone proposing ideas that don't happen to meet all the  
requirements.  Education, not exasperation, is the course to be  
taken.  And before someone is quick to point out that explanations  
were provided, yes, some were.  When the same proposals were made  
again, however, rarely was a  reference to the earlier explanation  
provided.
