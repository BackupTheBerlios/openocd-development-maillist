By all means, continue forward; I am not sure whether it will be easier
to revert the patch or simply apply a new patch that retouches the same
lines.  Personally, I would just go for a new patch and skip reverting.

&gt;<i> How soon -can you have this done?
</I>
Me, personally?  I am not working to a specific schedule, though I
realize this is a problem and have been trying to think about how to
address it (short of trying to get volunteers to help clean up my mess).
Since I am the one that committed it, I will take responsibility for
fixing it, but I want to avoid creating more problems in doing so.

&gt;<i> I have been dead in the water for a few days because of this... and 
</I>&gt;<i> started fixing things.
</I>
Patches are definitely welcome; they just need to do the right thing.
Please feel free to continue committing patches modeled after the one
that I just sent.  If you have doubt about the integrity of your fixes,
you should probably post them here first, which is what I was working
toward with my just-posted fragment of a series.

&gt;<i> I have other things [new work] that *need* -Werror fixed!
</I>
By all means, continue supplying fixes.  I am sorry to have caused these
temporary problems, but the code will be well-audited once it is fixed.
In that regard, I will only be glad to have made these changes if the
correct fixes are going to be applied.

Personally, I think these issues show that OpenOCD's type system was not
working as intended on all platforms, and we have simply exposed latent
bugs that needed to be addressed.  And as far as I am aware, only CygWin
has been broken by these changes: even MinGW32 compiles correctly, if I
have interpreted Michael Fischer's recent reports correctly.

Cheers,

Zach
