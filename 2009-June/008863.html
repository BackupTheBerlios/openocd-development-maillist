<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Does it seem to you like the reset process is flexible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; enough yet?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The idea is that those targets where the tcl reset
</I>&gt;<i> proc doesn't cut it would implement their own
</I>&gt;<i> tcl reset proc from scratch.
</I>
That seems undesirable when some key improvements can
be more generically available.

Like for starters, either a TAP event on TLR entry
or a settable parameter saying how many TCK cycles
must be issued in TLR before issuing JTAG commands.

What we have now is &quot;jtag_ntrst_delay milliseconds&quot;,
without clocks going.  &quot;jtag_ntrst_clocks&quot; would
address documented ICEpick and PXA255 constraints.

And there are no doubt other similar small tweaks.

Note the scaing problem with needing target-specific
rewrites of ocd_process_reset:  it's impractical to
combine two such targets on one board...


&gt;<i> This avoids switching 
</I>&gt;<i> programming paradigm from procedural to
</I>&gt;<i> event based, i.e. we could add events until
</I>&gt;<i> the cows go home and still miss that crucial
</I>&gt;<i> event for the next target.
</I>
I'd call the current reset &quot;events&quot; procedural
hooks, myself.  Heck, they don't even accept
any parameters ... :)

 
&gt;<i> I don't believe that it is possible to *ever*
</I>&gt;<i> add a reset event that is flexible enough for
</I>&gt;<i> all future targets.  I'm in favour of adapting OpenOCD
</I>&gt;<i> as we go along rather than create a hugely complicated
</I>&gt;<i> monster reset scheme that still won't catch the next
</I>&gt;<i> jtag router from hell problems.
</I>
Routers weren't the only, or even the main, set
of motivating examples...

But you seem to agree that the reset process
still has holes that need fixing (&quot;adapting&quot;);
so that question is answered.


&gt;<i> &gt;&#160;I'm thinking .. no:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;- All those reset events go to debug targets ... but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160; there's at least the ICEpick example, where a JRC
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160; needs 100+ TCK cycles after entering TLR, and it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160; easy to find others. &#160;Loading an FPGA, for one.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160; Those aren't targets; so no events...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not even sure that the reset concept even applies to
</I>&gt;<i> an FPGA. For Altera Nios I'd first like to program the
</I>&gt;<i> FPGA, then reset the CPU.
</I>
If I've got an FPGA *not* programmed with a Nios core,
that model doesn't work.  :)

That issue isn't entirely &quot;reset&quot;.  It's &quot;initialization&quot;,
which is a separable chunk of reset processing.  For a
Nios core you could have &quot;system reset&quot; requiring both
&quot;FPGA init&quot; loading the core, and then &quot;core reset&quot;.
But other FPGA bitstreams might not have a target.

 
&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;- I was looking at DM355 documentation and it clearly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160; distinguishes &quot;cold&quot; resets -- both TRST and SRST
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160; get cycled -- from &quot;warm&quot; ones -- SRST only. &#160;We
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#160; don't seem to have a clean way to do &quot;warm&quot; today.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> soft_reset_halt?
</I>
No, that's a different beast.  It applies to the current
target and doesn't involve SRST.

One reason to want a warm reset is that it leaves all
the debug/jtag stuff alone.  Maybe you tweaked some
settings so that some things become observable during
the reset/reinit sequence.


&gt;<i> [I've deleted those items where I had no useful input
</I>&gt;<i> at this time]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And I suspect that if I looked around a bit, I'd find
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more such cases where the reset model isn't (yet!)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; advanced enough. &#160;Thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A target/board config file can reimplement the
</I>&gt;<i> reset proc from scratch. How far does that get you?
</I>
As a &quot;user&quot;, way deeper into the undocumented innards
of OpenOCD than I want to be.  ;)

As a developer, it's hard to say without doing it.

My initial reaction is that the reset processes are
not yet factored well enough to support everything
that I've happened across.  But experimenting with
a few individual targets should help identify more
of the holes.

What I'd like to see is a kind of &quot;reset toolkit&quot;
which would make that practical.  But it's not
really there yet.  &quot;Reimplement ocd_process_reset&quot;
is not a scalable approach.
