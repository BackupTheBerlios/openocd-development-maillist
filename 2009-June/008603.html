It is not crap! If you deviate from a contract long enough then those
deviations become part of the contract. Written or not. Over here there
are several laws dealing with such situations. For instance: if you use
a piece of land for more than 20 years and no-one claims or requires you
to buy or rent that piece of land it is yours. Legally! Like it or not.

</I>
Skeleton in the closet. Nothing to be done about that. You think you
accepted the GPL terms, but you also accepted the exception. There is
enough evidence that the exception existed when you started working on
OpenOCD. 'I didn't know' and 'If I knew before' don't work in court.
