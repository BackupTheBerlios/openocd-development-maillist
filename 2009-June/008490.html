</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Moreover - I see no sentence which says that &quot;GPL-chain&quot; has to be

</I>
So that is impossible to have a GPL with exception project. Such project 
could not be used by any other GPL project, thus making such code 
worthless...

&gt;&gt;<i> 2. I also haven't seen any explanation about the &quot;binary patch&quot;, that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be marked as Non-GPL. Maybe I remember &quot;this violates GPL,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> period.&quot; explanation, so sorry - I'm not convinced either.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Section 2 of the GPLv2 states:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;2.  You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of 
</I>&gt;<i> it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such 
</I>&gt;<i> modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that 
</I>&gt;<i> you also meet all of these conditions: ...&quot;
</I> &gt;
&gt;<i> and section 4:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;4.  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program 
</I>&gt;<i> except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to 
</I>&gt;<i> copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will 
</I>&gt;<i> automatically terminate your rights under this License. ...&quot;
</I>
I wouldn't be distributing any Program, not it's modified version 
(Modification). Just a patch that would enable user to change his 
executable to some other executable.

&gt;<i> Since section 4 mentions modification separately, my interpretation is 
</I>&gt;<i> that you may not even modify a private copy unless it is done according to 
</I>&gt;<i> the terms of the GPL. Other people may interpret it differently.
</I>
Indeed which brings the next question? Why do you &quot;the most extreme 
interpretation&quot; take as the one that is true, and &quot;the softer 
interpretation&quot; as false?

&gt;<i> Anyway, with the amount of people who have expressed their concerns about 
</I>&gt;<i> the Windows version it shouldn't take that long to develop a proper, 
</I>&gt;<i> legally unambiguous solution to this problem rather than trying to hack 
</I>&gt;<i> around it rather than just complaining.
</I>
Again - not everyone here is a developer, there are many users here, who 
just wish OpenOCD to be what is was, not another Uber-GPL code for l33t 
users.

4\/3!!
