</I>&gt;&gt;<i> somethings that libusb 0.1 can't
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> libusb-win32 has two development branches. libusb-win32 0.1 is

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> o libftdi apparently works with libusb-win32's API (see for example
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Freddie's post)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> o libusb-win32 comes with 3 (maybe 4) backends
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - a libusb driver and a libusb filter driver (not sure if this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> differenciation is still correct)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - a HID backend (I've seen something like that with Keil's ULINK I guess,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which looks like a HID to Windows, and thus needs no driver)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - a WinUSB backend
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is libusb-win32 1.0 branch. Unfortunately it is not working yet and I
</I>&gt;<i> do not know when the author will get time to get it working. Several people
</I>&gt;<i> suggested WinUSB backend to fix Vista 64 issues. I suggested the
</I>&gt;<i> HID backend since there are issues to use libusb-win32 with HID device.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> o libusb-win32's drivers are supposed to be a dead end because they wont
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work with 64-bit windows (and probably not with Windows 7), but they do work for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> older versions that don't have WinUSB support (particularly 2000... leaving
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 98/ME behind doesn't sound overly disturbing to me)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> o the FTDI chips are not HID, so the HID backend is dead for our purposes
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The HID backend is for other device. There are many HID based device.
</I>&gt;<i> Typically we use native HID API to access HID device. But many programs
</I>&gt;<i> use libusb to access HID device under Linux.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> o the WinUSB backend brings a WHQL signed driver, which is good, because it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> runs on all windows versions that required signed drivers (Vista 64-bit,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Windows 7)
</I>
Just one more clarification. libusb-win32 can be made to support Vista
64bit and Windows 7 as well with a digital signature. It already works
under XP 64bit.

Vendors can also use libusb-win32 as their default device and get
it WHQLed with their particular VID/PID  if they want to do that. In that
case, it will actually take precedence than the non-WHQLed FTDI
driver+Vendor VID/PID combination. The FTDI WHQLed driver is for
unmodified VID/PID.

&gt;&gt;<i> o The WinUSB How-To says that you need to get the whole driver package
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> including the .inf file signed. Some postings to newsgroups suggest that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this is not necessary. It might be that you get a warning, which shouldn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be that much of a problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is ok to load the driver even though there is a warning. You can do
</I>&gt;<i> the same with libusb-win32 device driver if somebody can pay the
</I>&gt;<i> digital signature (not so expensive). One company already got their
</I>&gt;<i> libusb-win32 based device driver certified by WHQL but they
</I>&gt;<i> renamed all the driver name to their own name.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> o libusb-win32's development seems sporadic if not stalled
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can say it is stalled right now since the SVN is 22 months old.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Conclusions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> + libusb-win32 would be good, because it works on all present windows
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> platforms, and because it's supposed to work on upcoming versions, too
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> + libusb-win32 would be good, because it allows us to use libftdi, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implements all the FTDI-chip specific USB communication. Using the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information available in libftdi wouldn't be much of a problem, but it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> certainly a lot of coding work that is mostly unrelated to OpenOCD
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - I have no idea about how stable and reliable libusb-win32 is
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Based on my experiences it is quite good. The filter driver can cause
</I>&gt;<i> many problems (including serious BSOD and lost of all USB device)
</I>&gt;<i> and is no longer recommended by the author. The device driver has
</I>&gt;<i> never caused problem for me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> o (Re-)writing libftdi with plain WinUSB should be possible and would remove
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the uncertainties of libusb-win32, but would burden the OpenOCD project with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the task of keeping it stable and up to date. It would also leave out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Windows 2000 and before.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can always use libusb-win32+libftdi for Windows 2k.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If possible, some people with Windows knowledge can look
</I>&gt;<i> at the libusb-win32 1.0 branch to judge how mature (or im-mature)
</I>&gt;<i> it is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> WinUSB is a good solution with or without libusb-win32. If libusb-win32's
</I>&gt;<i> WinUSB backend can be made to work, it is of course better since it
</I>&gt;<i> will benefit other open source projects as well. But a WinUSB based
</I>&gt;<i> solution specific to OpenOCD (for FTDI) device may be easier.
</I>&gt;<i>
