The big problem with gray areas is that you can be sued anyway, and --
even if you have lots of money -- you will have no idea as to whether or
not you will be able to defend the legality of your actions.

If a dispute arose on such grounds, your legal representation would be
wise to advise you to reach a settlement, unless you could demonstrate
irrefutable evidence that vindicates you (which is nearly impossible).
The costs of going to trial and losing would be daunting in the face of
such uncertainty.  Inevitably, that means that you will be back to
complying with the terms of the GPL, everyone gains the pleasure of
paying their lawyers to learn more about the license, and maybe worse.

The community would be well advised to avoid these risks: use libftdi.

&gt;<i> IMHO, the best solution is to create a new DLL, which is distributed

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD(GPL) - links - OpenFTD2XX(LGPL) - links - FTD2XX(Closed)
</I>
I would be just as opposed to such circumvention as I would to linking
to it directly, but I believe the legality of this strategy is suspect.
Quite simply, an exception to the LGPL would create a new license, and
the modified legal verbiage would no longer be compatible with the GPL.

To reiterate my earlier statements on this subject, I will consider
distribution of any OpenOCD binary that links to FTD2XX to be a
violation of the GPL.  If the libftd2xx library loads in the OpenOCD
process, then distributing the binary would violate the GPL.

I have contributed enough to OpenOCD now that anyone contravening this
interpretation will be directly opposing the wishes of a copyright
holder who sees things that way.  I would expect this should seriously
impair the defense of any violations found in the future: the community
has been explicitly warned not to do this.  This is black and white.

The &quot;best solution&quot; is to fix libftdi; it is a replacement for FTD2XX.
I will say it again: libusb and libftdi can be improved to do anything
that the proprietary alternative does.  Addressing any remaining issues
with those libraries (e.g. driver certification) will cost pennies on
the dollar when compared to what should be expected from trying to
circumvent the binary distribution restrictions of the GPL.

Sincerely,

Zachary T Welch
Corvallis, OR

P.S.  At least one technical solution does exist that would allow FTD2XX
to be used with OpenOCD, without loading libftd2xx inside OpenOCD.
However, I think developing this feature will cost much more than simply
fixing any bugs and deficiencies with libusb and libftdi, and fixing
those libraries has more value for the broader open source community.
For this reason, my technical solution deserves to be rejected as well.
