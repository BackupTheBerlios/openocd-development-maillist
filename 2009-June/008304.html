All in all, I think you are right to say that it is not so easy to expect
average Windows users to build OpenOCD under Windows and there
will be a lot of support issues.

But here are some comments to your above assertions.
Using MinGW/Msys may be complicated. But it is not that difficult to use
Cygwin. Installaing Cygwin it can be an issue for average Windows users
though.

libusb-win32 device driver has the binary distribution. It is also very easy
to build the svn version under Cygwin or MinGW/Msys.

I believe you do not need the hacked libusb0.sys file. I think you just
need to create the INF file for the whole device in stead of individual
device. But  I need to get an FT2232x based JTAG tools to prove that.
Or Gene Smith can test that.

Michael has a nice tutorial here on building OpenOCD with different
configurations here.
<A HREF="http://forum.sparkfun.com/viewtopic.php?t=11221">http://forum.sparkfun.com/viewtopic.php?t=11221</A>

It needs some updates.

1) The FTD2XX build configuration is now changed with the latest
OpenOCD SVN.

$ ./configure --enable-ft2232_ftd2xx --with-ftd2xx-win32-zipdir=/home/mcuee/mcu
/openocd/CDM-2.04.16 CC=&quot;gcc -mno-cygwin&quot;

You need to replace /home/mcuee/mcu/openocd/CDM-2.04.16 with
the unzip directory of the FTDI Windows Driver ZIP file.

2) libftdi can be build under Cygwin pretty easily. Michael's SparkFun
post mentioned that there would be errors. But with the latest
libftdi 0.16 version, there are no errors any more.
