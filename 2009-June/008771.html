<PRE>Hi all,

Here is my summary of what I think needs to be done to prepare for a
&quot;source-only&quot; 0.2.0 release, which will help promote OpenOCD and maybe
attract new developers that can help fix the binary distribution issue.
Solutions for that problem can manifest themselves and be used with this
release, or another in the near future; in fact, they will be better if
they work with such a release archive, rather than a SVN snapshot.  

With that, we can turn to the means of ensuring OpenOCD is adopted by
the most common Linux distribution mechanisms: package managers.  For
each of the various Linux distributions, we need one or more &quot;Packagers&quot;
to maintain the required scripts or meta-data to produce compatible
binary packages.  Several are already known on this list, and they
should chime into this thread too.

The community needs a fair-sized herd of such individuals to support all
common distributions and release variants, but several of the big ones
have been covered by individuals here.  For derivative distributions,
most of the work can be shared and re-used, and the devil will be in the
details.  As the recent Ubuntu build threads have demonstrated, not even
successive releases of the same distribution may build the same way.

Thus, users on Linux must be treated just as on windows: they cannot be
expected to compile the code themselves.  However, Linux distributions
usually make packaging and distributing GPL-compliant binaries easier,
and most distributions provide source-only packages for situations such
as the ftd2xx driver (and some even have build kit tools).

If your distribution lacks a native package (and you cannot create one
yourself), please contact their mailing lists to try to recruit someone
to help you create one.  I think we could produce the 0.2.0 release
within a week -- and the 0.2.1 the week after, if something turns out to
have gone horribly wrong.  Anyone that wants to help us prepare packages
for the 0.2.0 release should get involved as soon as possible.

I would like to see broader adoption by distributions, but I know that
also means we need to be producing releases regularly.   By doing so,
those packagers stay interested in participating with the process and
ensuring the releases deliver value for their users (without patches).
This should help to create healthy positive feedback cycles with those
communities, as we should help make them and their users happy by fixing
bugs that affect their platforms.

The point is that only _developers_ that want to contribute (or users
running a fringe distribution) should need to compile the code for
themselves.  If you have building problems that the community cannot
resolve for you, then you may need to take the time (outside of this
community) to improve your development skills to fix it on your own, pay
someone to fix it, or perhaps try alternate commerce (e.g. barter).

Volunteer maintainers should not be expected to teach users how to fix
every bug they encounter, much less do the work themselves to resolve
the problems.  They have their own issues.  Users should not even
_expect_ answers to any support question here, though you will usually
find someone will answer, teach, of fix most of them for free.  Nothing
is 100% though.  Such is the life of users that can get this program for
free and use it with substantial freedom.** 

To be fair, there is the other side to this story.  Without regular
releases, users will probably never see &quot;stable&quot; packages distributed
for their OS in the manner that I have described.  Today, such users are
virtually forced into building from SVN (which is not attractive to
packagers or to distributions), so the maintainers are ultimately
responsible for resolving the same build problems over and over again.

When we improve the release process, these problems should disappear.
At that point, more build questions may be ignored for the reasons given
above.  However, these questions should begin to be directed away from
this community and toward the bug tracking software of the distribution
on which the user installed the package.  After all, building is highly
distribution-dependent; you should be asking their experts, not ours,
when trying to resolve these sorts of problems.

So again, we need to forget about the binary distribution problems in
the OpenOCD development community for the time being.  These issues will
all be resolved externally or in future releases.  This reason alone
justifies lowering their priority to allow the release to go forward,
because it does not change the impact for users.  In fact, it will only
aid in the process of finding resources to fix our outstanding problems.

Cheers,

** - If you received OpenOCD with hardware and you do not get support
here, then e-mail your hardware vendors!  They cannot say we are
required to support you here, and they should not be allowed to claim
that we should be your only OpenOCD support resource if you bought their
products.  However, they are not responsible for teaching anyone how to
build or package the code either; they have limited resources as well.
