</I>
Wrong.  A single copyright holder can prevent changes to the license.

Hi.  That's me.

&gt;<i> &gt; Why do you feel it necessary to disrespect
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; our copyright claims?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see how he is.  Now, the two interpretations of the license  
</I>&gt;<i> allow slightly different uses, but that isn't disrespect, it's a  
</I>&gt;<i> difference of opinion.  One that can't be settled by restating each  
</I>&gt;<i> other's side.  There needs to be discussion or an actual legal  
</I>&gt;<i> analysis that shows which interpretation is correct.
</I>
Do you dispute my claims to some fraction of the copyrights to OpenOCD?
Do you believe that fraction to be sufficient to give me legal standing?
I believe that I can make such claims.

&gt;<i> &gt; If we interpret it thusly, why do you think that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; your interpretation should be considered more valid than ours view?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What if I told you that my interpretation is based in part on having
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; paid an attorney to counsel me in such nuances?  Would that matter?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Probably, but so far, we've seen nothing but conjecture from both sides.
</I>
True.  It would take a court battle to find out anything certain here.

&gt;<i> &gt; You are being disrespectful to contributors that have made this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decision; it is theirs to make and theirs alone.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, the decision was to distribute under the GPL, not a specific  
</I>&gt;<i> interpretation of the GPL.  If it turns out that Freddie's  
</I>&gt;<i> interpretation has more legal ground, then you are stuck with  
</I>&gt;<i> complying.  That also isn't being disrespectful.  It's being true to  
</I>&gt;<i> the letter of the license.
</I>
I feel fairly confident that I understand these terms of the GPL.

&gt;<i> &gt; In that way, there is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no doubt that you _are_ creating problems by beating this dead horse.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is only no doubt to you and a few others.  This isn't a dead  
</I>&gt;<i> horse to the community.  It's a discussion where a few people want  
</I>&gt;<i> their way and refuse to hold discussion about alternatives.
</I>
&gt;<i>From the perspective of my contributions, it is dead.
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; What will it take to get you and others to drop this issue?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> An actual resolution by the community and not a triumvirate  
</I>&gt;<i> declaration based on their interpretation of the license.
</I>
I think you have a misunderstanding about copyright law.

&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cheers,
