Good!  We've been wanting to have source to that library.

What's the ftdichip.com URL for downloading *SOURCE* code
to that driver library?  I didn't see one when I browsed
their website last week...

Oddly enough, yes I do.  Unless it's part of the operating
system, which D2XX is not.  And I prefer to have the OS
source in hand, too.  Even if I can't freely redistribute
modified versions of it, as was the case with original
(academic) UNIX licences.


You might recall that one original impetus for the whole
Free Software movement was ... a vendor closing down a
printer driver, removing functionality that a community
had come to rely on.  (The &quot;Open Source&quot; thing came along
much later, from folk who thought such things were fine.)

That parallel printer driver wasn't quite what one would
call a parport driver today, but it was as close as one
generally got at that time.
