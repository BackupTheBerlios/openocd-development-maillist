</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ========
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Argument.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ========
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It is well know that  Dominic Rath, is the original author of OpenOCD. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> By reviewing his original releases that I find in the SVN repository, I

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As I understand (and Laurent or Dominic can confirm) Domenic worked with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Laurent to help develop the ftd2xx driver (and library) based jtag key.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Perhaps - I do not now - but I assume. Dominic and other developers of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the package at the time actively participated and encouraged the package 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to be *USED*WITH* and in fact *SOLD*WITH* this 'incompatible library'
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> While not *explicitly* *written* I view this as an original exception 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that was unwritten, but granted, as demonstrated by the original author, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and original copyright holder of the package as an acceptable exception.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We as a group, perhaps may not like this fact, but it is what it is. I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can not change that original exception, nor can anyone else. It was part 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the deal when each of us started to contribute to OpenOCD.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For example - see the Amontec &quot;Application note - copyright 2000 to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2006&quot; which explicitly references the FT22xx drivers.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     <A HREF="http://www.amontec.com/pub/amt_ann006.pdf">http://www.amontec.com/pub/amt_ann006.pdf</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I also point out the history of openocd on the Amontec web site
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     <A HREF="http://www.amontec.com/openocd.shtml">http://www.amontec.com/openocd.shtml</A>  (bottom of the page)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The person who can clarify any misunderstanding is Domenic, and Dominic 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alone.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem with your argument is that the license in the tree is GPL;
</I>&gt;<i> the license in all of the source code headers is GPL.  There are no
</I>&gt;<i> exceptions stated anywhere in the tree.  Consequently, this demonstrates
</I>&gt;<i> that my contributions were made under the GPL without any exceptions,
</I>&gt;<i> and I imagine that I am not the only contributor to have come to this
</I>&gt;<i> particular conclusion based on these same facts.  I am afraid that your
</I>&gt;<i> intent will not matter even one iota, in a court of law.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to make exceptions, then they do not apply to the new code.
</I>&gt;<i> You cannot retroactively change the license; however, you are free to
</I>&gt;<i> fork the code at a point prior to my having a claim on the copyrights,
</I>&gt;<i> and make an exception there.  Since said license will not be compatible
</I>&gt;<i> with the GPL anymore, you may not use the changes that I contributed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, this further presumes that I am the only one that will object
</I>&gt;<i> to such a change.  That may not be the case, and I hope that others
</I>&gt;<i> authors that share my views will step forward to confirm this point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,

</I>Yes the licence is  GPL, and there are no exceptions stated, unfortunatley.

It is definitly possible to add an exception to allow linking to non GPL 
libraries and still remain GPL, but it is not possible to force derived 
GPL works to do the same:
<A HREF="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLIncompatibleLibs">http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLIncompatibleLibs</A>
We only need the consent of the copyright holders.

All long time developers of OpenOCD has been aware of the status of the 
libftd2xxx as proprietary code,  have not been complaining and as such 
have been promoting this use. Or they have been living under a rock for 
the last couple of years.

So perhaps it is time to formalize this exception to GPL that we have 
been accepting for years and add the exception to the licence in our code.
I can tell you all that I have no objections to adding this exception to 
linking against a non GPL library as far as my contributions to OpnenOCD 
are concerned.

If anybody decides  otherwise then that  is  his  right but as far as I 
can understand it is possible to add this exception and still keep 
OpenOCD as  GPL code.

Best regards
Magnus
