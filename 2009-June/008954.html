<PRE>Zach,

*Finally a couple  pretty important questions*:

Fact of the matter is I have available an IAR jlink JTAG as well as the
olimex ARM-USB-TINY. I bought this with the  IAR eval kit ($300) but , so
far
I and my company seem to not want to spend the $3000 for the full version,
thus all the interest in GCC open source / eclipse  / openOCD.
The ARM-USB-TINY on the other hand ,
I purchased with my &quot;personal use, limited&quot; money (50 bucks).

Should I perhaps see if openOCD has better drivers for ulink / jlink
segger / IAR rebrand.   ?

Might these drivers work better and give me working breakpoints even with my
older supposedly 0.1.0 version of open OCD. ?

Or does the jlink require the FTDI dll or driver or whatever it is that
breaks your
GPL license ??

Sincerely,

Joe

P.S. - This is a follow up to my last send, please check out the questions
there too,
          but what I learn here may affect what I do.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; has on my request.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We cannot &quot;build a binary with FTD2XX support for you&quot; because

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; My vender is Olimex, for my jtag, I am not sure about their level
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; of support they would provide.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> They have some responsibility for providing support for their product;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> however, the OpenOCD community does not.  Still, you will probably find
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> us more responsive and pro-active, though I could be wrong on this. :)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Is there a tutorial on building openOCD myself ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I believe one has been posted on the SparkFun forum, though I have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> requested patches to add such instructions to the repository itself.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Please let me know if you find instructions that work for you, or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consider producing your own to help improve our in-tree documentation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Finally is it a known fact that Luminary parts do not work for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; breakpoints and some new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; version that you have will fix my problem ?? I do not  want to build
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; unless
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; it will provide a fix for my problems. Or ??
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I cannot say.  You probably need to try it and report your findings.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Furthermore, the initial hurdle of compiling it will position you to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> keep up with any changes that do fix that problem (or others).
