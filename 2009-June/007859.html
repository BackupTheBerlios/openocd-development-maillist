</I>Yes.

I had the segger jlink commander installed so its driver ran when I 
plugged in the jlink and didn't work with openocd. I had to replace it 
with the driver from libusb-win32-device-bin on sourceforge. (A &quot;no 
driver found dialog&quot; would have popped up if I didn't have segger 
installed already, I think.) Uninstalling segger jlink tools did not 
remove the segger driver. Had to go into Control Panel/System/Device 
Manager and update the jlink driver to point at the new jlink.inf file I 
had made with the libusb-win32/bin inf-wizard. Then I browsed to the 
actual unsigned driver pointed to by the inf, libusb0.dll from the 
libusb-win32-device-bin distribution to complete the installation. I did 
not try to use the &quot;filter&quot; driver which I think can coexist with the 
segger driver (according to a post by Xiaofan which seems to be the only 
mention of whether this 3rd party driver is really needed by openocd).

Note: the segger driver appeared under &quot;Universal Serial Bus 
Controllers&quot; in Device Manager (winXP) while the libusb-win32 driver 
appears as new top level Dev Mgr category &quot;LibUSB-Win32 Devices&quot;.
