The JTAG layer is clean of target dependencies without these patches
(except for the ZY1000 and dummy minidrivers), so I think we should try
to implement fixes that preserve this.

*twitch*  Slippery slope.  Since it's scope is limited, the required
abstraction to preserve layering should not be too difficult, right? :)
I prefer to avoid adding more layering violations, since I have been
working to eliminate these from the system.

At the very lest, there should be @todo notes indicating a layer
violation is necessary, but that presumes such is strictly necessary.

&gt;<i> The flag used in [patch 1/3] might better be modeled as a
</I>&gt;<i> global mutex gating ownership to the JTAG stack ... but
</I>&gt;<i> that concept isn't there in the code.  The target stack

</I>
A mutex seems required for SMP, but it also seems premature.  Proper
threading support should be a 0.3.0 or later change, but a wrapper to a
global seems like a viable transitional solution.

&gt;<i> Maybe the stuff in [patch 2/3] would better be modeled
</I>&gt;<i> as JTAG events delivered to that TAP.  Target code would
</I>&gt;<i> just listen for TAP enable events.
</I>
I was thinking the same thing.

Cheers,

Zach
