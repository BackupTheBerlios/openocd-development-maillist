<PRE>Attached is a proposed bulk write optimization for mips_m4k file transfers. The
motivation was to speed-up image loading on the mips_m4k target to reach similar
transfer times as the xscale target.

M            2399   src/target/mips_m4k.c

Summary:

Bulk transfers are currently done with word accesses using the PrAcc data
register.  This optimization uses a working-area, if available, to load a
download routine into ram.  The download routine uses EJTAG FASTDATA transfers
to transfer the data.  This greatly decreases load times because:
 - code fetches are no longer through the PrAcc register, the code is executing
in ram.
 - stack is also in the working-area
 - Use of only the FASTDATA register minimizes JTAG access.
 - the call to jtag_execute_queue() is made only after building the entire
buffer transfer queue.

The idea is taken from the xscale debug_handler loaded into a mini instruction
cache. The mips_m4k does not have a convenient place to load a download routine
like the xscale's mini IC.  Instead this patch has been tested with a
working-area in system ram. This requires that the external memory controller be
initialized, most commonly in a board script. The alternative is to lock enough
ways in the instruction cache to make an internal code area.  But the system ram
approach is simpler and allows full use of the cache for the program under
debugging.

If a working area is not defined, the code will work as before; bulk writes will
issue a series of word writes that uses the PrAcc data register.

This only affects bulk memory writes; byte, short and word accesses still use
the PrAcc data register.

There is support for FASTDATA bulk reads. However, there is currently no
bulk_read_memory equivalent for bulk_write_memory.

I have probably missed some problems with this approach or it's methods.  Still
this code builds and runs and the result is file transfers times decrease
dramatically.
