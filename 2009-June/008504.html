During this discussion several suggestions were made how a binary
distribution that interacts with ftd2xx could look like. Some of them
most likely did not comply with the GPL, other probably do comply with
the GPL, even in your certainly very critical view.

In these cases your choice of words indicated that these GPL
compatible solutions were known to you but you chose not to disclose
them to the community.

Are there any other solutions that you are aware of but haven't shared
in this discussion?
