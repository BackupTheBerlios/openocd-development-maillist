&gt;<i> You cannot have both libftdi and FTD2XX support in
</I>&gt;<i> the same FT2232 driver binary, so this patch not even allowing testing
</I>&gt;<i> them both using the same openocd binary (presumably by adding/removing
</I>&gt;<i> the OS drivers between tests).  
</I>
Why is that so impossible? init() will try to load one of the libraries, 
and in case of failure will try using libftdi. The order is just because 
ftd2xx.dll is available as library, whereas libftdi is not. Yesterday 
I've thought about that issue a bit and come to conclusion, that I'd 
have to modify libftdi code so that it would load libusb0.dll dynamically.

&gt;<i> Personally, I think that I have failed to see the value of this patch,
</I>&gt;<i> but maybe I have missed something.  In contrast to the strategic
</I>&gt;<i> solution, what problems does this current patch solve for OpenOCD users,
</I>&gt;<i> today?  Without a clear answer to this, I am not sure why we want it.
</I>
To compile openocd you need to specify dozens of options for configure, 
because some of them are exclusive (like support for libftdi and 
ftd2xx). I think that it would be possible to modify the code in a way 
that ALL possible interfaces would be enabled. It's easier to compile 
with &quot;bootstrap, configure, make&quot; than browsing through docs to find all 
required configure options... Of course I cannot do that alone, as I'm 
not a skilled and experienced developer.

When there would be a binary release it could have just the executable, 
without any libraries attached. Now when you do a binary release with 
maximum number of interfaces enabled you need to attach some libraries 
to it. For example compiling support for rlink makes libusb0.dll 
required, even if the end-user uses Wiggler. He doesn't need the library 
for use, but OpenOCD won't start without it.

Moreover - I haven't noticed any thread where anyone would plan on 
adding &quot;driver modules&quot; in some form to OpenOCD. Actually I remember you 
and few other maintainers opposing the &quot;driver modules&quot; solution, as a 
door for closed-source drivers.

4\/3!!
