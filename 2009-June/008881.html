Zach already posted a list of known acceptable alternatives, so if you
have something that is *not* on that list, then it would be a good
idea to check with the list.

Perhaps that list should contain a list of known *unacceptable* alternatives.
:<i>-) (Or did it? I don't recall). Transparent attempts at circumventing GPL
</I>was one of the unacceptable alternatives.

It goes without saying(doesn't it?) that if you make changes to OpenOCD
and that patch is rejected because it's use would be a breach of GPL,
then the use of such a patch, even if it is not committed to the official
tree is *still* breach of GPL.

(If anyone reads this and wonder why I'm such a GPL nutty, here's
a reminder: I would never have gotten involved in OpenOCD if
there was a loophole that could be exploited to implement closed
source target support. GPL is the best line of defence against
closed source target drivers, even if it's a royal PITA sometimes.)
