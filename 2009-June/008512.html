</I>
A fair question.  The key solutions (build kit and sockets) have been
covered, and I also suggested getting the vendor to switch to the LGPL. 

Why did I choose to withhold these solutions?  Because I want to see
libusb and libfdti fixed, as I have made clear from the beginning.
Professionally, I work on open source software, so I have zero incentive
to enable users of proprietary software to avoid the GPL restrictions.

These loopholes stand to allow proprietary software to continue to work
better than the free alternatives.  For a supposedly free and open
software project, that seems like shameful behavior to me.  I would have
betrayed my own values -- and the values of the free software community
-- if I had suggested them.  However, it would have been a bigger
betrayal of this community to withhold confirmation of their validity.

In each case, I was fast to provide assurance that these solutions would
be acceptable.  I could have simply ignored those suggestions and
allowed others to posit my opinion, channeling discussions back to the
open source solutions.  I did not do anything like that; I have been
working to ensure that the community considers all of the options fully.

It is a tough road to walk, but I would do it the same way if I had to
do it over again.

Cheers,

Zach
