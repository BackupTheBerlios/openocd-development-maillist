<PRE>The strong vs weak typing issue is very vague and either side could be  
defended for nearly every programming language as you can see from  
this very discussion.  See <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly-typed_programming_language">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly-typed_programming_language</A> 
  for more examples.  In the grand scheme of things, weak vs strong  
has very little to do with the suitability of a language for a design  
pattern or algorithm.

I'm proposing that we use encapsulation and possibly ADTs to define  
clear boundaries for functionality in the code base.  Rather than have  
one massive code base, I'd like to see subsystems that can be worked  
on internally with minimal effect to the users of that subsystem.   
OpenOCD has some of that and Zach has been doing a lot of work to  
refine that.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've commonly heard C and C++ referred to as strongly-typed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Never *once* have I heard that usage before yours.  Usually C gets
</I>&gt;<i> described as a weakly/loosely typed language.  (This is in the
</I>&gt;<i> context of multiple classes and seminars that did comparative
</I>&gt;<i> studies of dozens of programming languages and type systems.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The fact
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that you can't declare a variable without a type is an indication of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No; it just means they have types, and require declarations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But in fact, C doesn't require, and never has required, types
</I>&gt;<i> for everything.  I just compiled the following; no errors, and
</I>&gt;<i> not even any warnings unless I specify &quot;-std=c99&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    main(argc, argv)
</I>&gt;<i>    {
</I>&gt;<i> 	argc = argv;
</I>&gt;<i> 	return 0;
</I>&gt;<i>    }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Over time, C has integrated mechanisms that lets one's code
</I>&gt;<i> trigger warnings from some flavors of type abuse.  But at
</I>&gt;<i> its core, it's still weakly typed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Plus, having a declaration says nothing about whether that
</I>&gt;<i> will be &quot;strongly&quot; enforced, or can instead be suborned.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> void * let's you work around some undesirable effects of strong-
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> typing, but it is a type itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That &quot;work around&quot; means &quot;violate any type rules you want&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> which is prima facie evidence that the type system is not
</I>&gt;<i> what's called &quot;strong&quot; ... either at compile time, or at
</I>&gt;<i> run time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Contrast that to something like LISP or Lua ... or even TCL.
</I>&gt;<i> In key ways, those have stronger typing than C:  they have
</I>&gt;<i> only a handful of data types and you can't escape them.
</I>&gt;<i> (That property is also a flavor of what's called &quot;safety&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> and one which lends itself to crash-free software.  C is
</I>&gt;<i> not known for being crash-free; neither is C++.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But on the flip side their type systems are not extensible,
</I>&gt;<i> so when you build abstraction layers you've got to define
</I>&gt;<i> your own typing conventions.   Which can't be enforced at
</I>&gt;<i> compile time (another aspect of &quot;safety&quot;, which would help
</I>&gt;<i> some other robustness characteristics), so they're weak in
</I>&gt;<i> those respects.  Yet C provides some extension mechanisms...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> However, I'm all in favor of evolving code to respect clearly  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> defined
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> data types, which encapsulate roles and responsibilities to support
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> better system structures.  If there's a better way to do it, I've  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> yet come across that answer.  :)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's really all I'm recommending.  I've seen a dynamic- and  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> strongly-
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> typed language do very well for doing encapsulation and using ADTs to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make a very clean system architecture that allows for lots of future
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extensions.
