Sorry, I thought you were recommending naming things such as  
&quot;omap3530&quot; for both the target and TAP.  As long as we stick to  
descriptive names such as &quot;omap3530.cpu&quot; for both, I'm OK with it.   
The confusion can partially be resolved by changing the layout of the  
commands.  Right now, the TAP-related commands are spread out (some  
are under JTAG, some are top-level (irscan, drscan), etc).  The target  
commands are less so, but still are to an extent (targets are created  
with 'target create', but every other operation is done on the target  
name rather than 'target &lt;target_name&gt;').  If we straightened out the  
commands such that it is obvious which namespace we are working in,  
then the confusion of overlapping namespaces would be reduced  
considerably.  I'd still prefer to keep the -chain-pos portion of the  
target command since I'd not a fan of automagic operations.  We could  
make it optional and have the default be the target name, but I'd like  
to keep the option of being explicit and to allow for non-standard  
naming.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 					If you make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the names the same, people get confused when the $(target name)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> command isn't available but the TAP has been created.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People are always free to be foolish.  If &quot;targets&quot; doesn't list
</I>&gt;<i> the name, there is no target.  TAP != target except on very simple
</I>&gt;<i> systems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
As long as the command structure and documentation make this obvious,  
it's fine.  As it stands today, it's not obvious that the reason  
'halt' failed it because it is trying to use the current target name  
as a command, but that target doesn't exist.  This gets worse if you  
have more than one target.

&gt;<i> Although ... this reminds me how the &quot;scan_chain&quot; command is
</I>&gt;<i> buried so deeply in the user's guide.  I'll send a patch to
</I>&gt;<i> present it when scan chains are presented ... which will help
</I>&gt;<i> better distinguish the &quot;list of TAPs&quot; and &quot;list of targets&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> concepts, by properly presenting both of them.  (Though it'd
</I>&gt;<i> be nice to have tap-list primitives like we have target-list
</I>&gt;<i> primitives...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
There is a definite learning curve when dealing with OpenOCD.  We  
don't do a good job of hiding the details of JTAG from the user.   
Fixing that is a long-term project, but we can at least make it better  
in the short term by describing the JTAG layer early on and  
partitioning commands into logical layers.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 							Which just
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> points out another conceptual problem ... either (a) &quot;target create&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> should force target and TAP names to be the same (so &quot;-chain- 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> position&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> becomes redundant), *or* (b) we need a &quot;list enabled taps&quot;  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> primitive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Minor nit:  I should have written &quot;mechanism&quot; not primitive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And part of why I think that (a) is preferable is that it would let
</I>&gt;<i> us avoid creating parallel &quot;$target_name tapisenabled&quot; predicates
</I>&gt;<i> to match the already-working &quot;jtag tapisenabled $tap_name&quot; one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Such a redundancy wouldn't be great, but relying on target_name ==  
tap_name isn't good for long-term extensibility.  Chip designers like  
to lots of strange things.  Imagine a single TAP that has the debug  
registers for two separate target types.  You can't have 2 targets  
with the same name even though they use the same TAP.  Of course, the  
'target $target_name isenabled' isn't always a direct translation to  
checking if the TAP is enabled.  There could easily be some other set  
of items within the target's registers that determine if it is  
enabled.  In the simple case, it can be implemented as just looking up  
the tap name and asking the JTAG layer if the tap is enabled.  A more  
complex case would likely always check if the TAP is enabled and then  
perform other checks.  I can see value in a general &quot;target is  
enabled&quot; command.

&gt;<i> Another is to avoid the nastiness inherent in the current capability
</I>&gt;<i> of running &quot;target configure -chain-position foo.bar&quot; *after* the
</I>&gt;<i> target has been set up.  I can't ever see goodness coming from that...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yup.  We definitely should partition things into init-time settings  
and run-time settings.  There are a number of things that really  
should only be set on target (or tap) creation.  Imagine someone  
trying to change the width of the TAP IR at runtime.

&gt;<i> That is, it would help keep the layer distinction:  there's a TAP
</I>&gt;<i> layer, and a target layer.  TAP operations don't work on targets,
</I>&gt;<i> and vice versa.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Some TAPs are isomorphic to targets too, and in the simplest systems
</I>&gt;<i> there may be only one tap == a target.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Right.  I don't think our command structure today does a very good job  
of keeping them separate or distinguishing which layer a command is  
part of.  If we group the TAP commands under the 'jtag' command and  
target commands under the 'target' command, it is _much_ clearer.
