You are wrong, because I just still don't get it how a 
GPL-with-exception can exist. If the GPL-chain has to end on the system 
libs, what is the purpose of having GPL-with-exception? Such code 
clearly cannot be used in ANY GPL project, because such project would 
also have to have an exception for that GPL-with-exception. So what - 
now we would have an endless chain of exceptions? Either I'm too stupid 
to understand that, or the license is too stupid for normal person to 
understand this nonsense.

Moreover - you are quoting the INTERPRETATION of the license found on 
the site, that has huge interest in the most extreme interpretation of 
all... Where does that say that in the license? The text alone, not &quot;The 
most extreme FAQ about GPL on this planet&quot;.

 &gt; See ... how your first &quot;no explanation&quot; whine was in fact
 &gt; fully addressed at the very beginning of the flamewar you
 &gt; have been feeding.

Let's not forget who ignited that whole &quot;war&quot;. You.

&gt;<i> Are you a distributor?  If so, why aren't you having this
</I>&gt;<i> conversation with your own legal team?
</I>
Again - I do not own a company, nor do I work for one that would make 
any money on OpenOCD. I'm just a Windows USER who wishes OpenOCD to be 
popular. That's it - nothing more, nothing less. While you see no 
problems with lack of installer with ftd2xx.dll, I see quite a lot. So 
our lack of understanding is mutual - I just don't get GPL, you just 
don't get libftdi+Windows problems.

4\/3!!
