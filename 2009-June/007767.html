</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Minor nit:  I should have written &quot;mechanism&quot; not primitive.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And part of why I think that (a) is preferable is that it would let
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> us avoid creating parallel &quot;$target_name tapisenabled&quot; predicates
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to match the already-working &quot;jtag tapisenabled $tap_name&quot; one.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Such a redundancy wouldn't be great, but relying on target_name ==
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tap_name isn't good for long-term extensibility.  Chip designers like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to lots of strange things.  Imagine a single TAP that has the debug
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> registers for two separate target types.  You can't have 2 targets
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the same name even though they use the same TAP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had imagined that, but realized that since we don't have any such
</I>&gt;<i> monstrosity today, we could defer that issue until later if we wanted
</I>&gt;<i> to go the simpler &quot;require $TAPNAME == $TARGETNAME&quot; route.  :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It doesn't make the code any simpler and doesn't change the typical  
case for the end user either.  It just limits the flexibility and  
forces a code change if we ever run into such a device.  $TAPNAME ==  
$TARGETNAME can definitely be the typical case, but we should support  
$TAPNAME != $TARGETNAME since the cost to do so is minimal.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 		 Of course, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 'target $target_name isenabled' isn't always a direct translation to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> checking if the TAP is enabled.  There could easily be some other set
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of items within the target's registers that determine if it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enabled.  In the simple case, it can be implemented as just looking  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the tap name and asking the JTAG layer if the tap is enabled.  A more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> complex case would likely always check if the TAP is enabled and then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> perform other checks.  I can see value in a general &quot;target is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enabled&quot; command.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, we don't have such cases today.  We can speculate all kinds
</I>&gt;<i> of things, but in the absence of real hardware I don't think the
</I>&gt;<i> results of speculation are compelling.  Plus, &quot;$target_name curstate&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> has a very limited range of state outputs, and it would need to grow
</I>&gt;<i> to accomodate such states.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Actually, many Cortex-A8 designs include power/clock gating for the  
processor core.  Such devices may have the TAP enabled, but the target  
isn't enabled because the power/clock is turned off to it.  I'm not  
sure that a &quot;$target_name curstate&quot; is the right idea either since as  
you pointed out, it would need to grow to handle these cases and we  
won't necessarily know what all of them are.

&gt;<i> The IEEE 1149.7 stuff seems to incorporate a &quot;tap state&quot; model of
</I>&gt;<i> sorts ... parts relevant to OpenOCD would be the power states, and
</I>&gt;<i> whether it's routed into the scan chain or not.  I'd say those use
</I>&gt;<i> cases are relatively &quot;near future&quot;.  Not so with &quot;target state&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Another is to avoid the nastiness inherent in the current capability
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of running &quot;target configure -chain-position foo.bar&quot; *after* the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> target has been set up.  I can't ever see goodness coming from  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yup.  We definitely should partition things into init-time settings
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and run-time settings.  There are a number of things that really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should only be set on target (or tap) creation.  Imagine someone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trying to change the width of the TAP IR at runtime.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Part of why that's not allowed.  :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's the target stuff that's goofy that way, not TAP stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm aware.  I was pointing out the parallel.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> That is, it would help keep the layer distinction:  there's a TAP
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> layer, and a target layer.  TAP operations don't work on targets,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and vice versa.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (Some TAPs are isomorphic to targets too, and in the simplest  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> systems
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> there may be only one tap == a target.)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Right.  I don't think our command structure today does a very good  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> job
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of keeping them separate or distinguishing which layer a command is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> part of.  If we group the TAP commands under the 'jtag' command and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> target commands under the 'target' command, it is _much_ clearer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So to get back to the real &quot;it's *BROKEN* and 0.2.0 needs a fix&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> issue ... sounds like you would be happier with
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	$target_name tapname
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> command to return the TAP, so the startup.tcl loops would look
</I>&gt;<i> something like
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	if { [jtag tapisenabled [$t tapname]] == 0 } {
</I>&gt;<i> 		continue
</I>&gt;<i> 	}
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> or something similar, instead of assuming the target is enabled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes?
</I>
Either that or add '$target_name isenabled' that has an implementation  
that does '[jtag tapisenabled [$target_name tapname]]'.  The latter  
means we won't need to revisit this when we do the full '$target_name  
isenabled' handling.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And fixing &quot;$target_name configure ...&quot; so it disallows changing the
</I>&gt;<i> target position or endianness after target setup.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Dave
</I>
Yup.  Definitely necessary for 0.2.0.
