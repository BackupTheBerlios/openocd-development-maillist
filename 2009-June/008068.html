The extra parentheses and braces do not hurt anything, however.  They  
_do_ make it easier for those who are newer to programming or to  
clarify the sets of tests being done.  I'm personally not fond of  
incorporating multiple logical (as in separate tests, not specifically  
those using logic operators) tests into a single statement.  If they  
are going to be, then I prefer the unnecessarily parentheses be used  
to separate the logical tests to make the statement more understandable.

While certainly true, it doesn't mean that we _need_ to remove all  
extra braces.  Sometimes they are for clarity rather than functionality.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I personally find the excerpted line confusing and clunky.  I _do_  
know what it does, but only because I've written the exact same code  
to handle the error cases returned by stroul.  Without seeing the rest  
of the code, here's what I don't like about it:
  - okay is a poor choice of variable name.  Its name declares that it  
is &quot;okay&quot;, but it really is telling you _if_ something is okay.   
is_okay is much clearer.
- There are really two separate tests being done sequentially.  The  
first is to see if the whole string was used to generate the number.   
The second is to see if the parsed number was larger than an unsigned  
log.  That isn't immediately clear even though operator precedence and  
associativity means it evaluates that way.
- The use of 'okay' seems potentially unnecessary.  Even if the test  
is being used to determine multiple control flow paths, the code can  
usually be changed to only need a single if.  The variable declaration  
doesn't really add anything to the clarity.
- If you are testing that a variable is non-NULL, write that.   
Similarly for a test for NULL.  Taking the short-cut just makes it  
less clear what you are doing and why.  Besides, it isn't necessarily  
guaranteed that NULL will always be 0. ;)
