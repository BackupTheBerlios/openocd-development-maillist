Well, there's the &quot;immediate NAK&quot; from folk currently on this
mailing list; yes, that'd rule it out quickly!

But lacking one of those it's not a &quot;go&quot; either.  That rough list
had over fifty names and getting the corporate approvals is rarely
fast even if it does happen.  I suspect FSF would not be keen on
relicensing this particular exception, to pick just one name.


&gt;<i> Personally I'd try to fix the libftdi issue first... if I was using 
</I>&gt;<i> Windows that is.
</I>
Yes.  That's an insurmountable &quot;if&quot; though!


&gt;<i> Yet, it must be noted that libftd2xx is dynamically linked on Linux.  
</I>&gt;<i> If the Windows version is also a DLL then it is arguable whether or not 
</I>&gt;<i> they are already linked when the OpenOCD binary is distributed.
</I>
One might argue that, yes.  Safer IMO not to though ... especially
if a D2XX.dll (or whatever) is distributed with the OpenOCD binary.


&gt;<i> Currently the library must be available for openocd to execute at all, 
</I>&gt;<i> but if dlopen() was used instead then the libftd2xx usage would be 
</I>&gt;<i> merely equivalent to a plugin.  And aren't loadable modules for OpenOCD 
</I>&gt;<i> on the roadmap?
</I>
Actually it would not be equivalent to a plugin ... and plugins
have their own licensing issues.  It's been a few years since I
participated in such discussions, but perhaps a few folk here
have noticed the GCC 4.4 licensing discussions. GCC is set up to
support plugins in the near future, and finalizing the license
terms for that caused some release delays.  I'm sure that some of
the technical issues there would be relevant, and recent.
