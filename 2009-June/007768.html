<PRE>duane&gt;  $TARGETNAME mdw

david&gt;  You'll notice most of the reset-init event handlers can't use that.

CAN'T - or &quot;just happen to not use that&quot; - Big difference.

By design, they should be able to do exactly that, see:

     src/target/target.c - lines 3559 ... 3731

By design, it should work, that is why for example how [$TARGETNAME cget 
-chain-position] works.

======================

duane&gt;  (B)  Hidden in C code... effectively enforced, like above, see 
 target.c
duane&gt;  - line 3444..3456

david&gt;  That is, the &quot;-chain-position&quot; logic should change?

Yes, exactly. What is happening here is the &quot;tap_by_jim_obj()&quot; is passed 
the argument to the -chain-position parameter.

I suggest instead, doing a simple &quot;sprintf()&quot; and add &quot;.tap&quot; as a suffix 
here
That can be done *IN*CODE* - or in the CFG file...

One could argue (2)(A) or (2)(B) - either way... it's a toss up.

=====

david&gt;  If one were to take your (1) forcing the &quot;.tap&quot; suffix, then IMO
david&gt; the correct route is to take your (2A) and change all scripts,
david&gt; plus (1a) update the TAP naming convention to tell folk not to
david&gt; use &quot;tap&quot; themselves, and (1b) when creating targets, reject
david&gt; any target name with a &quot;.tap&quot; suffix.

I do like your approach  - it *enforces* a specific naming scheme that 
is unambiguously clear that &quot;foo.tap&quot; is the *TAP* and not the thing the 
tap is controlling, be that &quot;boundary scan&quot; or &quot;a cpu&quot;, or a &quot;embedded 
flash&quot;.

david&gt;  This seems to me like it'd be much thrash for not much benefit.

In consumer electronics, the most important thing is: &quot;Can the customer 
understand/install the product without using the manual&quot;.   In our case, 
that will be impossible, but reducing manual lookups is a good thing.

There's a subtle thing here that I did when I created these new 
commands, I quietly enforced inline documentation of parameters in the 
script files.

How?  I *COULD* have made the parameters positional, ie: 'the 5th 
parameter is the tap name' - but i did not on purpose. By *REQUIRING* a 
prefix it serves as *EXPLICIT* documentation of the parameters purpose, 
one does not need a comment line above the script command explaining the 
positional parameters :-) 

Look at the &quot;flash bank&quot; command as a *nasty* example.
(tcl/target/sam7x256.cfg - line 48)

Sure, it is extra typing - but - it is *far*less* end user and developer 
confusion, after a few parameters I can't keep track of the order of things.

It's not thrash if it becomes *in*line* documentation, think +2 years 
from now, with +10 more targets, and +10 more boards, they will be 
better documented, that is the bigger win.

-Duane.
