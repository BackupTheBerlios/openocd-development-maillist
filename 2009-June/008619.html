</I>
No matter how you want to call the legality of the situation, I hope
that you will admit there is something clearly unethically about what
you are proposing.  I hope the libftdi author(s) would never allow
re-licensing for such dubious efforts.

Since it remains a legal gray area, it seems silly to go down this road
when solutions exist that are compliant, without any kind of effective
subterfuge.  

&gt;<i> &gt; Furthermore, I think individuals can be held liable for &quot;inducing&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; infringement, which is where IANAL becomes useful in some respects.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have been repeatedly warning _against_ infringement and to consult
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with an attorney on any possible solutions that you intend to distribute
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in binary form.  You should be too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is no infringement here, so there is nothing to debate. The
</I>&gt;<i> issue gets a bit murky when the replacement dll is bundled with
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD, but that is not really necessary, the user can load it from
</I>&gt;<i> elsewhere.
</I>
The intention to design this library for the purpose of circumventing
the GPL is being documented on this list.  Sure, it's murky, but the
discussion only helps to build my case to defend against this option.

The problem you will face: can anyone in this community show they were
working on that option for us, before all of these issues came to light?
Lacking a paper trail, how can you explain your motive for doing this?
If there _is_ shown to be infringement, it will be plainly intentional,
and that may mean some cash will be left over after paying the lawyers.

By all means, show me this evidence and I will permit this option.  If
you cannot, then please drop it from further consideration, for the
ethical considerations alone.  Or are &quot;ethics&quot; an unrealistic position
from which to make such a plea?  Certainly, you _are_ free to ignore my
ethical stance; likewise, do not expect me to help you in those efforts.
I see them as sabotaging the free software community.

Legal gray areas do not have GPL-compliant solutions.  They take risks
of being compliant or not.  Risks are unacceptable for OpenOCD vendors,
when there may exist potential threats.  These risks can be avoided,
because they disappear by embracing full and unarguable GPL-compliance.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; -  FTDI ?   no their libray and driver is called in accordance with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; their documentation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - OpenOCD ?  nobody has touched a single line of OpenOCD code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - Copyright holders of libftdi, Intra2Net AG ?  no,  libftdi is LGPL and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the new library would only use the header file in accordance with LGPL
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; section 3.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Would  it work? with a bit of tweaking I would think so.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Is this a blatant attempt just to work around the problems with OpenOCD,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; GPL and libftd2xx ?  What do I know ? Maybe yes, but that does not make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; it illegal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It might.  This is a very gray area.  For the love of all that is sane,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; why do you want to keep pressing these fronts, when other options have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; been presented that will solve the problems without any objections?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> TCP/IP will impose a speed penalty. It may be a nice extension for
</I>&gt;<i> other purposes, but for daily work it is most likely not the best
</I>&gt;<i> solution.
</I>
In addition to that solution, I have pointed out that libusb and libftdi
features and performance can be improved.  The community can try to get
FTDI to go LGPL with their code.  There is also a &quot;build kit&quot;, which
creates user-built binaries; this should produce the same binaries they
were getting before this &quot;problem&quot;, so there would be zero performance
impact to users (other than a longer install process).

Altogether, this puts four options on the table, all of which still seem
realistic to me.  Can you show me concrete evidence to the contrary?
The build kit solves the problem completely, and that kind of tool does
not seem like a difficult challenge for an experienced developer.

I have come up with another new idea, but I need to vet it with the FSF
before I suggest it here.  I _may_ have found a new loophole (related to
the build kit), but I am very uncertain about its legality.  Heck, I may
ask the FSF to pay me to bury it forever, if it is truly novel!  ;)  
While it would improve things a little, I do not want to get hopes up.

Also, developers that build OpenOCD can use it like it is today, right?
Rick pointed out that we are catering to binary distributions with these
considerations, which is not strictly our mission.  We produce source,
and the project already appears to be GPL-compliant in that respect.

Cheers,

Zach
