It's not about distribution. The patched binary obviously doesn't  
satisfy the terms of the GPL, so by my interpretation you no longer  
have the license to use it. This renders the patch pointless.

My opinion is that if some software uses a certain license then you  
have to follow it. This is partly out of respect for the authors,  
partly because of the categorical imperative and partly out of a sense  
of self-preservation. If you can't obey the terms of the license then  
you don't use it. Sometimes that means you can't take the easy way out  
and that you don't get everything for free, but that's just the way it  
is.

&gt;&gt;<i> Everyone who uses OpenOCD is a developer in some capacity.
</I>&gt;<i> Perfectly true, but you agree that using USB on Windows in C++ is not

</I>
If you're a firmware engineer, the odds are sooner or later you'll be  
tasked with working with a device that communicates over USB. At that  
point it is extremely useful to be able to write even some bare-bones  
communications software without having to wait for some driver  
developer to do their bit.

&gt;&gt;<i> Look at it as an opportunity to learn some new

</I>&gt;<i> I'd love to, but I'm affraid that before I'd do anything Windows 7

</I>&gt;<i> solution!) is required now, not in months or years.
</I>
Ah, but just think about all those hordes of Windows OpenOCD users who  
will be waiting to shower you with gratitude..

Regards,
Anders
