Hello list!

Wookey napsal(a):
&gt;<i> +++ Freddie Chopin [2009-06-24 16:56 +0200]:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Important Qestion - Is OpenOCD meant for users to use, or just to be 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;100%-GPL-at-any-cost&quot;?
</I>
Good question!
GPL is to bring free software to users, to support evolution of
software, this is what was meant when the license was created.
There may be many examples found when literal interpretation of legal
documents does not end up with the aim of its author, some examples may
be found in law. That is why there are courts and juries -
otherwise a case could be decided by some robot or artificial intelligence.

What I state here is not lack of respect to the license but what I ask
for is to interpret GPL as it was meant, not in some kind of tendentious
way. We have to understand the real sense and meaning of the license,
its PURPOSE, not just read it as sequence of words - legal document is
NOT a computer program so just don't read it like a compiler.

&gt;<i> We need to just fix the problem for users (by getting a
</I>&gt;<i> licence-compatible USB driver for windows people who currently don't
</I>&gt;<i> have one).
</I>
Here we go... ftd2xx is part of the driver, thus we may think about it
as part of the hardware. OpenOCD, compared to other projects, is a bit
specific in that it requires hw connectivity solution and there has to
be a way to communicate with hw.
If OpenOCD communicates with some driver backend over TCP, it would be
100% OK with literal interpretation of GPL. The question is: Would it
make the code better in any sense? Would it make the code more free?
(Remember GPL is about liberty.) I say no, this would not make any
difference.
This problem touches virtually any software using closed hw connectivity 
solution.

An example: if I program an extension or connector (wrapper) for some
closed library, which enables it to be conveniently used and I would
like release the source to the public am I forbidden to use GPL license
for my work just because it (by definition - as it is aim of the
project) links to a closed library? Yes or no?
Application for tweaking graphics card chip of certain manufacturer 
might be another example.
No doubt that using LGPL would be a better choice, but again, am I
forbidden to use GPL?

In the light if the examples above:
the project was started by Dominic Rath, and he included support
ftd2xx. This is very important, because this was his choice - the choice
of the only one author that day. Isn't it similar? OpenOCD links with
ftd2xx &quot;by definition&quot; from the days the project was started.
So ftd2xx was originally meant to be linked to OpenOCD, it was not added 
later. Dominic, please correct me, if I am wrong.

Nevertheless it would be fine if this issue is finally fixed so that no
more nitpickers could bother the community by reopening it.

Please do not take the above as call for ignoring licensing issues, it
is not meant like that, the point is: overinterpretting legal documents
may lead to really absurd situations, this is what we have to bear in mind.

Best regards,
   Pavel
