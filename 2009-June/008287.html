I assert OpenOCD is a portable code base and such assumptions about  
data types are invalid.

In this limited case where a mask is used as part of the argument to  
printf is fine since the data range is clearly expressed as part of  
the printf.  Of course, the choice of uint32_t might have been poor to  
begin with.  If the original data required between 17 and 32 bits then  
uint32_t is appropriate. If the data was guaranteed to have a more  
limited range (perhaps by the same mask), then using an int or  
unsigned int to begin with would be more appropriate.  Remember, if  
you use the correct data type for the range of values required, the  
compiler has less work to do.  In this contrived case, the compiler  
would need to do a 64-bit promotion on the argument if compiled on 64- 
bit windows even though the data is guaranteed to be within the 8bit  
range.  Either a cast to unsigned char and %hhu or a cast to uint8_t  
and PRIu8 is more appropriate.

</I>&gt;<i> duane&gt; Here, under OpenOCD we generally:
</I>&gt;<i> duane&gt; (1) assume that all embedded openocd targets are *32bit* at  
</I>&gt;<i> most...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> rick&gt;  This is a bad assumption since it limits us from supporting  
</I>&gt;<i> various DSPs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To fix this, requires that we introduce a &quot;CORE_ADDR&quot; type - much  
</I>&gt;<i> like GDB has internally, but in a far more complex way. Remember:  
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD is 'target agnostic' - ie: Pic32 - is built in - same as ARM  
</I>&gt;<i> - same as Future64Bit - thus CORE_ADDR will be a complex dynamic  
</I>&gt;<i> type with specialized addition and subtraction routines, that are  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;current target aware&quot; for example:
</I>

If doesn't _need_ to be that complex.  You can simply choose a large  
enough data type to encapsulate the largest target address size.  That  
should be hidden behind a typedef, however, so it can be changed  
later.  Then each target is responsible for validating the target  
address range when committing it to the hardware.  In practice this  
works reasonably well. (Yes, I've done exactly this for tools that  
analyze data from various bitwidth architectures)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   CORE_ADDR   target_address;
</I>&gt;<i>   target_addr +=  1;  //  illegal
</I>&gt;<i>   CORE_ADDR_add( &amp;target_addr, 1 ); // allowed
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It becomes more complex when/where the target has a *true* Harvard  
</I>&gt;<i> architecture, and/or non-linear escoterica memory
</I>&gt;<i> (while *ARM* is generally Harvard, the majority of implementations  
</I>&gt;<i> make that go away)
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> duane&gt; (2) assume all host platforms are at least 32bit host platforms

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This line of reasoning is a red-herring.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
No, it's assuming portability rather than a specific set of  
architectures.  If someone wants to run OpenOCD on a 16-bit processor,  
it should still work unless we happened to have introduced bugs in our  
use of the type system.  By using the C99 types and printf macros, it  
doesn't matter what the underlying size of 'int' is, uint32_t will  
always be 32-bits.

</I>&gt;<i> rick&gt; And that is horribly wrong for &quot;u32&quot;.  %x will change size  
</I>&gt;<i> between 32-bit and 64-bit windows versions since &quot;int&quot; changes size.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree it is *WRONG* when the value represents a &quot;TARGET_CORE_ADDR&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> type. But this has *NOTHING* to do with the

</I>&gt;<i> But otherwise it does not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example: A target 32bit value (perhaps the contents of memory)  
</I>&gt;<i> the resulting value will never take on any value larger then 32bits  
</I>&gt;<i> on the host. Thus, any host side calculation must be performed with  
</I>&gt;<i> host type of least 32bits *UNTIL* the sufficiently interesting  
</I>&gt;<i> component of that value has been extracted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At that point, the author of the code may choose to use any other  
</I>&gt;<i> sufficiently wide enough variable type to hold &quot;the interesting  
</I>&gt;<i> component&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I again assert all openocd hosts are at least 32bit (or larger)  
</I>&gt;<i> basic machines. Thus, I assert that a host side cast to &quot;int&quot; or  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;unsigned int&quot; is at least a 32bit value and in many cases is  
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient for the majority of printf() like values,  
</I>&gt;<i> TARGET_CORE_ADDR - the exception.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
As I've pointed out time and time again, 'int' is not guaranteed to be  
of any particular size.  Assuming otherwise limits portability for no  
reason.  If you need a 32-bit value, use the data type guaranteed to  
give you 32-bits regardless of platform.  'int' is generally something  
to avoid unless you really don't care what type it is.  That is  
limited to cases such as loops over small integer values (e.g. 0 to  
10) which will fit in the smallest C data type.  The author of a piece  
of code can always choose to use a larger type than strictly  
necessary, but that doesn't mean they should choose a type that can be  
any size.
