<PRE>All - I believe - I am not sure - that the primary benefit of 
&quot;libft2xxx&quot; is as follows:

(a)   It is measurably faster.

    That just requires &quot;work&quot; to make it faster.

(b)   It works on more platforms, ie: Win7, WinVista, because drivers 
exist for those platforms.

    This is tough/hard, nobody on this list is a &quot;windows driver developer&quot;.
    Grrr. Such is life.

(c)   Nobody was offering a universal &quot;libusb&quot; - type &quot;INF&quot; files for 
windows.

    Looks like Freddie Chopin is working on that :-)  Perhaps - we could 
have a &quot;contrib&quot; folder with a *binary* libusb0.sys file
    and associated &quot;INF&quot; files that references *ALL* ftdi based dongles 
- (The VID/PID list is in the source file...)
    That *INF* file and matching SYS file should be deliverable with 
OpenOCD.

(d) There is another choice -  &quot;WinUSB&quot;

    <A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa476426.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa476426.aspx</A>

As I understand, it is a a multi-(windoze)-platform solution that 
exposes the USB device, functionally in the same manor and style as 
&quot;libusb&quot; does, ie: the ablity (1) to rd/wr endpoints, (2) send control 
commands.

I believe there is the only open question that needs to be asked and 
answered.

The MS-WinUSB driver - did not  *ship* with WinXP, but is available as a 
&quot;co-install&quot; for WinXP.

As I understand (I have not confirmed, and I do not know all the details 
of it), the driver and associated OS-libraries/headers are *PRESENT* on 
Vista, and I presume Win7 (with appropriate dev tools installed), 
therefore it functionally *SHIPS* with the operating system, and as such 
it sould fall under the standard operating system component exception to 
the GPL.

This solution is - by design - something that can be added to WinXP (the 
co-install solution).  I think of it sort of like this: &quot;The old system 
only supplied a CDROM (read-only) driver&quot; - later - new systems come 
with CD-WRITER (and today, we have CD-RW) - the *new* os does not 
require an upgrade, the *old* os has an upgrade path to make the 
CD-WRITER (and now CD-RW) work.

I should - as a user of that old system - install the OS update - and be 
able to make use of that GPL software.

All is not rosy and perfect, &quot;WinUSB&quot; would require an INF file that 
*points* to the driver - much like the work that Freddy is working 
towards with a universal libusb inf file

Agree?

-Duane.
