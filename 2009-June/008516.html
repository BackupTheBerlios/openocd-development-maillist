</I>&gt;&gt;<i> published,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the source code is also not published - it cannot be GPL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Correct.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Am I correct in thinking that the 'driver' forms part of the operating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nope.  If it did, this would not be a problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And that the library is the non-GPL part that is the problem?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Correct.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If that is the case, the simple solution is to develop a GPL version of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> library, but continue to use the driver.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As Xiofan Chen pointed out, there is already an incomplete project at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ftd2xx">http://sourceforge.net/projects/ftd2xx</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Arguably, this could work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IMHO the libusb-libftdi is a massive overkill that causes other problems 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Windows users. Mainly because it is trying to replace the driver, not 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the problematic library.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My own problems with libusb-libftdi are:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. I have 6 devices that are regularly used with my PC that use one form 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> another FTDI device. Because these are of varying ages, the drivers 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> versions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are different, they must be installed in a correct order or some of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> devices fail. Why is this a problem?, because running FT_Clean in order 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> install libusb-libftdi will remove all of these drivers as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This sounds like a bug in FT_Clean.  Please report it to FTDI.
</I>
This is not a bug in FT_Clean, it is meant to clear your system of all FTDI 
drivers.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I does not sound fair to blame libusb-ftdi for this.
</I>
I'm not blaming libusb-ftdi, just pointing out a few problems with using 
that method.
If I had to use libusb-ftdi, I would have to use two FTDI devices, one 
installed with the FTDI driver, the other with libusb-ftdi.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. I have two other programs that make use of my JtagKey, replacing the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> driver with libusb-libftdi will break these programs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do these programs do?  Can we replace them with open source code
</I>&gt;<i> alternatives, perhaps in the context of OpenOCD?
</I>
One is a proprietary program, the other an automated test program that 
writes data to an I2C device.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I may be wrong with one or more of my assumptions, if I am then please
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> politely point this out, as I said at the start - I do not want propogate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this war of words.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The war is over, but battles still rage due to poor communications.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My intention of replacing FTD2XX.lib with a GPL version is NOT an attempt 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> circumvent the GPL, such as the wrapper methods that have been suggested. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> believe that if a GPL library was available, using the existing driver 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not be a GPL violation, and the whole solution would be a cleaner more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> palatable solution for all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does the GPL ftd2xx library use libusb or libftdi internally?  This
</I>&gt;<i> alternative has been suggested before this, but it just seems far more
</I>&gt;<i> trouble than it would be worth.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I kind of don't need to say this next bit ........ but what are your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thoughts ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have posted several alternatives on the list, but you do not make it
</I>&gt;<i> clear whether or not you need to distribute binaries.  If you do not,
</I>&gt;<i> then these matters should be of no serious concern for you.  Continue to
</I>&gt;<i> build the package for yourself as you have in the past; nothing has
</I>&gt;<i> changed.
</I>
No I do not need to distribute binaries, I will continue to make private 
builds.
I was simply pointing out some of the problems that Windows users will 
experience (who maybe cannot build their own).
And also suggesting a solution that would avoid these problems.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,

BR,
Ian.
