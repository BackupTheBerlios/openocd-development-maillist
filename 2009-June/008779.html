<PRE>Hello Maciej,

Maciej Grela napsal(a):
&gt;<i> A friend of mine pointed me to the threads concerning
</I>&gt;<i> GPL/windows/building/libftdi/libusb/libd2xx. After reading all this an
</I>&gt;<i> idea came to my head - what if we implement our own GPL/LGPL version
</I>&gt;<i> of libd2xx.dll ?
</I>
This is also an option, but there are problems mainly in maintainance of 
compatibility - these days there is more than just a single version of 
the chip while FTDI keeps compatible API - I am not sure whether the 
compatibility is maintained in the driver or the DLL but I experienced
a situation after driver update that different versions of driver and 
DLL are not necessarily compatible.


&gt;<i> From my investigation it seems, that the driver does all the hard
</I>&gt;<i> work, the DLL itself just calls some ioctls.
</I>
However, this is completely undocumented.


&gt;<i> Also, the driver is the
</I>&gt;<i> only thing, that needs to be signed if I understand correctly.
</I>
Yes, you are right.


&gt;<i> Obviously, GPL code can communicate with drivers using system calls so
</I>&gt;<i> I don't suspect any traps.
</I>
Correct, despite (as stated in my previous post) I really do not like 
the qualification of communication to &quot;GPL allowed&quot; and &quot;GPL 
prohibited&quot;, GPL speaks so.


&gt;<i> Also, Freddie, can I ask for more details about your performance
</I>&gt;<i> comparisons ? You've said, that libd2xx performs better than libftdi
</I>&gt;<i> but is this only under windows ? What is the speed difference between
</I>&gt;<i> libftdi + libusb under linux, libftdi + libusb under windows and
</I>&gt;<i> libd2xx + native windows driver ? I'm trying to figure out if the
</I>&gt;<i> windows driver does some magic to speed up the transfers or does
</I>&gt;<i> libusb suckiness on win32 cause it's inferior performance.
</I>
The problem with libftdi used to be that it was not able to do async I/O
operations, which meant that data was not read from the chip during 
writing larger block to it - this might cause buffer overflow. Because 
of that there had to be quick write/read turnarounds with small block 
sizes - what fits into the on-chip buffer. However when I looked into 
recent libftdi sources I assume this is no longer true, so the 
performance difference shall not be that significant these days - in theory.


Best regards,
   Pavel
