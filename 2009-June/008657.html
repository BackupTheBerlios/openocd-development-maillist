The OpenOCD was and always will be my project. I'm constantly following the 
list, although I'm not able to read each and every post, especially when the 
number of messages explodes like it did recently.

I'm voicing my concerns when I see changes that interfere with some key design 
ideas that were part of the original code I released. The last issue was the 
removal of the asynchronous in handlers, which were then reinstalled in a 
different way but achieving essentially the same goal which was fine with me. 
I do think it is important to point out how I wanted some things to be used 
when this isn't clear from the code.

I saw speculations about what I might have intended which is when I first 
responded to the current issue. Being the one who followed the project from 
its very beginning I believe I do know some things that others may have missed 
or never heard about.

Regards,

Dominic
