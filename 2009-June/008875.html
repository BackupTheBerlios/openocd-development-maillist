It isn't possible with the current ft2232.c code because it uses conditional 
compilation to compile either with libftdi or FTD2XX. While offering basically 
the same functionality there are not only syntactical but also semantical 
differences. If ft2232.c was to support both libraries in one binary there 
would be some rework required. I'm not sure if that effort is worth it since 
ftd2xx might eventually go away in the not too distant future.

&gt;<i> &gt; Personally, I think that I have failed to see the value of this patch,

</I>&gt;<i> To compile openocd you need to specify dozens of options for configure,

</I>&gt;<i> ftd2xx). I think that it would be possible to modify the code in a way

</I>&gt;<i> required configure options... Of course I cannot do that alone, as I'm
</I>&gt;<i> not a skilled and experienced developer.
</I>
A user who compiles the OpenOCD for his personal use is normally going to use 
only one or maybe two different JTAG interfaces. The available options can be 
looked up with ./configure --help.

Packagers building OpenOCD for a Linux distribution, Windows, or some other 
software platform (as opposed to packagers building for a particular JTAG 
interface) are a different story. I suppose they're interested in being able 
to build for the widest variety of interfaces.

Building is always going to require the library headers to be present. If all 
interface drivers were to be built unconditionally you'd have to have all 
headers present on the build system, which isn't good imho. Hence the off-by-
default convention.

&gt;<i> When there would be a binary release it could have just the executable,
</I>&gt;<i> without any libraries attached. Now when you do a binary release with
</I>&gt;<i> maximum number of interfaces enabled you need to attach some libraries

</I>&gt;<i> required, even if the end-user uses Wiggler. He doesn't need the library
</I>&gt;<i> for use, but OpenOCD won't start without it.
</I>
Exactly - but that's not related to the configure options. Being able to 
produce a OpenOCD binary that _could_ use all possible JTAG interfaces, but 
doesn't require installation of all prerequisite libraries would be nice.

Regards,

Dominic
