<PRE>Splitting my response here in two parts ... this first one
seems more in the &quot;after 0.2.0 ships&quot; territory.

&gt;<i> Sorry, I thought you were recommending naming things such as

</I>
But Duane suggests e.g. omap3530.cpu (target) vs omap3530.cpu.tap ..


&gt;<i> The confusion can partially be resolved by changing the layout of the

</I>&gt;<i> are under JTAG, some are top-level (irscan, drscan), etc).  The target  
</I>&gt;<i> commands are less so, but still are to an extent (targets are created  
</I>&gt;<i> with 'target create', but every other operation is done on the target  
</I>&gt;<i> name rather than 'target &lt;target_name&gt;').  If we straightened out the  
</I>&gt;<i> commands such that it is obvious which namespace we are working in,  
</I>&gt;<i> then the confusion of overlapping namespaces would be reduced  
</I>&gt;<i> considerably.
</I>
I could see &quot;jtag irscan&quot; etc (better:  &quot;jtag execute $arrayname&quot;).

But remember that &quot;irscan&quot; and &quot;drscan&quot; apply to the entire
scan chain, not individual TAPs; there aren't many commands to
address individual TAPs.  That'd seem post-0.2.0 no matter how
it all shakes out.


&gt;<i> I'd still prefer to keep the -chain-pos portion of the   
</I>&gt;<i> target command since I'd not a fan of automagic operations.  We could  
</I>&gt;<i> make it optional and have the default be the target name, but I'd like  
</I>&gt;<i> to keep the option of being explicit and to allow for non-standard  
</I>&gt;<i> naming.
</I>
That's where I started.  Easier to explain that way too: it
works &lt;this simple/obvious way&gt;, unless &lt;advanced wierdstuff&gt;.

Then I noticed that there *is* no such wierdstuff today, and
so I entertained the slightly subversive thought that we should
try to do without the wierdstuff for as long as possible, and
at least until we have real use cases for it.



&gt;<i> As long as the command structure and documentation make this obvious,  
</I>&gt;<i> it's fine.  As it stands today, it's not obvious that the reason  
</I>&gt;<i> 'halt' failed it because it is trying to use the current target name  
</I>&gt;<i> as a command, but that target doesn't exist.  This gets worse if you  
</I>&gt;<i> have more than one target.
</I>
However, nothing you've said offers a *fix* for that bug...
