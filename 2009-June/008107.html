This is potentially poorly worded, but correct, behavior.  You asked  
OpenOCD to start using a device that isn't attached to the machine.   
While USB does support hot-plugging, not all of our supported  
interfaces do.

&gt;<i> 2. With openocd correctly running and connected, if the jtag is
</I>&gt;<i> disconnected I see a continuous stream of &quot;usb bulk write failed&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> messages. Reconnecting the cable does not fix the situation and the
</I>&gt;<i> errors keep coming. The only way to recover is to kill openocd and
</I>&gt;<i> restart it.
</I>&gt;<i>

This is a known problem.  We don't support disconnect/reconnect on  
USB.  We could.  In fact, Dick had patches for FTDI-based devices to  
do so.  The danger here is failure cases where an instance of OpenOCD  
was running with a dongle attached.  That dongle was disconnected,  
attached to a different target board, and reconnected.  To OpenOCD,  
we'd assume it was a reconnect to the same target.  We'd need some way  
to force a reexamination of the JTAG chain on reconnect to determine  
if it's the same target or not.  This all gets very messy.  So, for  
now, we should probably terminate if the interface is disconnected.

&gt;<i> These aren't big problems for me now, but I would prefer to have  
</I>&gt;<i> openocd
</I>&gt;<i> running as a background daemon/service, out of sight/out of mind, that

&quot;He said he hadn't had a byte in three days. I had a short, so I split  
it with him.&quot;
