&gt;<i> It isn't possible with the current ft2232.c code because it uses 
</I>&gt;<i> conditional compilation to compile either with libftdi or FTD2XX. While 
</I>&gt;<i> offering basically the same functionality there are not only syntactical 
</I>&gt;<i> but also semantical differences. If ft2232.c was to support both 
</I>&gt;<i> libraries in one binary there would be some rework required. I'm not 
</I>&gt;<i> sure if that effort is worth it since ftd2xx might eventually go away in 
</I>&gt;<i> the not too distant future.
</I>
I never said that supporting both &quot;drivers&quot; at once is just a matter of 
removing these:

#if (BUILD_FT2232_FTD2XX == 1 &amp;&amp; BUILD_FT2232_LIBFTDI == 1)
#error &quot;BUILD_FT2232_FTD2XX &amp;&amp; BUILD_FT2232_LIBFTDI are mutually exclusive&quot;
#elif (BUILD_FT2232_FTD2XX != 1 &amp;&amp; BUILD_FT2232_LIBFTDI != 1)
#error &quot;BUILD_FT2232_FTD2XX || BUILD_FT2232_LIBFTDI must be chosen&quot;
#endif

I know that the code would need reworking, but if the maintainers of the 
project don't want such changes that's fine for me. Maybe I didn't dig 
into the code enough, but I think that such reworking is not impossible, 
and not extremely hard.

&gt;<i> Building is always going to require the library headers to be present. 
</I>&gt;<i> If all interface drivers were to be built unconditionally you'd have to 
</I>&gt;<i> have all headers present on the build system, which isn't good imho. 
</I>&gt;<i> Hence the off-by-default convention.
</I>
But you'd only need headers for libusb, ftd2xx and libftdi - that's not 
hard to get...

&gt;<i> Exactly - but that's not related to the configure options. Being able to 
</I>&gt;<i> produce a OpenOCD binary that _could_ use all possible JTAG interfaces, 
</I>&gt;<i> but doesn't require installation of all prerequisite libraries would be 
</I>&gt;<i> nice.
</I>
As I said (three times [; ) - that's the main idea.

4\/3!!
