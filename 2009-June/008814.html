Yes.  This is completely insane: that you would continue to ask me for
advice that should be best answered by legal counsel.  I am not a lawyer
and cannot give you the advice that you need, but virtually everything
that you saw thrown at this argument from me was received from one long
ago (and I paid the bills).  

This community has received nothing but free advice on this topic from
me, in consideration of your feelings.  I am under no obligation to
educate you, and I am getting increasingly frustrated by the fact that
everyone seems to think they are right.   Each individual must now
measure my commitment to the GPL and judge how willing I am going to be
to try to defend my rights in OpenOCD, in light of the understanding
that I have have presented to date on this list.

Please.  The debate is over; legal counsel is unavoidable for you,
unless you wish to demonstrate _further_ negligence.  I do not care what
any individual here thinks any longer; unless _you_ are licensed to
practice law, you need a qualified lawyers to assess this situation and
give you real advice.  I have been relaying what I paid mine to tell me
years ago, you are getting that knowledge for free, but it is being
challenged and questioned.  Fine: go pay for your own legal advice.

Again, you will continue to be negligent should anyone making money from
OpenOCD do anything less than this.  I can assure you that they will
tell you -- very clearly -- that you should try to avoid any gray areas
in the GPL.  You are welcome to disregard our advice in this area, but
it would be taking a big risk to do so.  You could be putting you
long-term business interests in legal jeopardy, and I am actually
helping to protect your interests in this regard.  I should be thanked.

Cheers,

Zach
