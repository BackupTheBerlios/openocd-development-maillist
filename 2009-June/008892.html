Well, not loud...but yes. ;-) After finding myself in the proprietary
library trap with OpenOCD once, I'll take extra care not to get caught
again.

Since now the patch hadn't been committed because of technical/strategic
problems, for example the inability to create a single binary, which
supports all external libraries. This is not new, but Freddie's patch
showed, that it should be possible in general.

...not even Richard Stallman. AFAIK, all people involved have agreed,
that this patch doesn't violate the GPL. Thus, it should be save to
apply it to the official release and distribute resulting binaries with
FTD2XX support.

For packagers, just to make things clear: The patch is GPL as well, even
it it's not part of the official repository. You must make sure, that
the source including all applied patches are distributed on the same
medium as the binaries. And, as stated here several times, you are not
allowed to distribute OpenOCD with FTDI's proprietary libraries in a
single package.

It's the user's decision to combine them. I'm *again* voting for adding
a warning, that this will limit the user's freedom. After this list
needed several hundred posts to find a solution, how can you expect the
same from the casual user?

Harald
