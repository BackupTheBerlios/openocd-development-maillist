Bullshit.  What is effectively killing OpenOCD for Windows is the fact
that you and others would rather bitch about the situation than do
anything about it. 

If you cannot write code, then you need to convince (or pay) other
developers to fix it.  If all of OpenOCD's users chipped in, I bet each
of you would pay less than any commercial alternative.

I just posted two confirmations of legal alternatives, of which I have
been aware since before these threads started.

You are spreading FUD.   Please.  Stop.  Now.

Cheers,

Zach
