So here is the summary.

1) Shorter solution:
a) Release a working libusb-win32+libftdi
version with some known shortcomings (not working for 64bit Windows,
lack of COM ports, lower performance, etc). Get the inf files
and the binary package ready for Windows users. This
is GPL compliant.

b) Prepare good private build instruction for FTD2XX. Release a
build kit (Cygwin zip file with the necessary tools, build scripts to fetch
the FTDI D2XX driver and build OpenOCD with FTD2xx). This does
not pose problems with GPL. The resultant OpenOCD binary can not be
distributed without violating the current GPL license.

2) Mid-term solution if it is feasible
Release a non-GPLed FTDI Server for the FTDI based Jtag debuggers
using FTD2xx communicating via sockets (or via some other messaging
mechanism).

3) Long term solution: just several possibilities. Some of them may
be more difficult than the others.

a) Improve the libusb+libftdi based solution within OpenOCD. This is
anyway needed. Non-blocking I/O is one key factor to boost
performance.

b) Try to ask the vendor FTDI to release the FTD2xx library as GPL
compatible. This is not likely to happen any time soon. But no
harm trying.

c) Contact all the OpenOCD developers to see if relicencing is
possible or not (to grant exception to FTD2XX). It seems to me
that some developers are avid about GPL. So I think this is also
difficult. But the efforts may still make sense. For example, if
there is only one or two who do not want to grant the exceptions
and his contributions can be re-written, then that may still make
sense to do it.

d) Improve libusb-win32, get the driver digital signed to solve the
64bit Windows issues. Some HW vendors may be able to help.
They can even get their HW driver WHQLed with libusb-win32
as well. This may be outside the scope of OpenOCD community
but the community can play a part.

e) Improve libftdi.
This may be outside the scope of OpenOCD community but the
community can play a part.

What do you think about this summary?
