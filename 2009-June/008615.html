If a third party develops a libftdi.dll replacement then there is no
reason a user can not use that replacement. The GPL license that
applies to the user does not restrict at all what he does with the
code or binary as long as he does not distribute binaries of it.

Obviously to put the dll wrapper wrapper under a GPL+exceptions
license it would have to be written from scratch rather than just
copy&amp;pasting GPLed libftdi header files (although one could ask the
libfti author to re-license his/her files).

&gt;<i> Furthermore, I think individuals can be held liable for &quot;inducing&quot;

</I>&gt;<i> I have been repeatedly warning _against_ infringement and to consult

</I>
There is no infringement here, so there is nothing to debate. The
issue gets a bit murky when the replacement dll is bundled with
OpenOCD, but that is not really necessary, the user can load it from
elsewhere.

&gt;&gt;<i> - &#160;FTDI ? &#160; no their libray and driver is called in accordance with

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - OpenOCD ? &#160;nobody has touched a single line of OpenOCD code

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the new library would only use the header file in accordance with LGPL
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> section 3.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Would &#160;it work? with a bit of tweaking I would think so.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is this a blatant attempt just to work around the problems with OpenOCD,

TCP/IP will impose a speed penalty. It may be a nice extension for
other purposes, but for daily work it is most likely not the best
solution.
