<PRE>This patch enables dynamic loading of ftd2xx.dll in ft2232.c on Win32 
platform.

It's made to work only on Win32 and for ftd2xx.dll in ft2232.c - it 
doesn't affect linux, libftdi or any other modules that could use that.

That's the first from a series that I am planing (win32 only):

1. (this one) enable dynamic loading of ftd2xx.dll in ft2232.c
2. enable dynamic loading of libusb0.dll in ft2232.c
3. make it possible to have support for both libftdi and ftd2xx at the 
same time in ft2232.c

n. enable dynamic loading for some other modules - jlink, rlink, presto

n+1. make it possible to have support for both libftdi and ftd2xx at the 
same time in presto.c

I can do the same for linux, but as I have no means for testing I'd 
rather pass that to someone else. With help in testing I can try to do 
that myself.

What would be the opinion of maintainers? Should I continue?

Anyone with FT2232 based dongle and Windows - please test. When 
compiling enable ft2232 with ftd2xx.dll only, as there are other 
interfaces that use dynamic libraries not yet &quot;converted&quot; to dynamic 
loading. I can also provide you with a compiled executable, as current 
trunk doesn't build on Windows - in such case contact me and I'll post 
such executable somewhere.

The main difference is that patched copy would run WITHOUT ftd2xx.dll, 
so you may test in the following way:

1. locate all ftd2xx.dll occurencies that can be reached through system 
PATH (usually in /bin/ with openocd, Windows/system32, but sometimes may 
be more) and rename them to anything else - for example ftd2xx.dl_

2. trying to run some earlier version would result in failure, as 
windows would not be able to load library. even &quot;openocd -v&quot; will fail

3. Modified version shoud run and in case of using ft2232 based config 
files should report an Error (on command line!) that the library cannot 
be loaded. &quot;openocd -v&quot; shoud work without problems.

4. Rename at least one ftd2xx.dll to original name and try again - 
modified version should work as expected.

4\/3!!
