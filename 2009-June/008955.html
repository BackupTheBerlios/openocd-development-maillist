Yes, you may _use_ OpenOCD source code however you like, including by
creating binaries that use the proprietary FTDI library.  As long as you
do not distribute the binaries, you are GPL-compliant.  Use is free with
closed source components, but such uses can't be distributed.  

Incidentally, &quot;internal use&quot; in a company is not &quot;distribution&quot; (AFAIK),
so you can share a binary with your work group without fear too.  This
somewhat derives from the nature of companies being a &quot;single entity&quot;,
but any type of distribution outside of the company employees (even to
contractors) may become a violation of the GPL distribution language.
At a certain point, it becomes safer to provide a build environment and
make everyone compile it themselves -- that's always compliant. :)

Cheers,

Zach
