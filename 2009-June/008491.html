There is no problems in using GPL code together with GPL+exception  
code. Combining all of that with with code under some third license  
depends on a number of things. Again, see the GPL FAQ.

&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;4.  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> otherwise to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will

</I>&gt;<i> I wouldn't be distributing any Program, not it's modified version
</I>&gt;<i> (Modification). Just a patch that would enable user to change his
</I>&gt;<i> executable to some other executable.
</I>
Right, but section four says &quot;You may not copy, modify, sublicense,  
*or* distribute the Program&quot; (emphasis added). If it just concerned  
distribution then there would be no room for interpretation.

&gt;&gt;<i> Since section 4 mentions modification separately, my interpretation  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that you may not even modify a private copy unless it is done  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> according to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the terms of the GPL. Other people may interpret it differently.
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed which brings the next question? Why do you &quot;the most extreme
</I>&gt;<i> interpretation&quot; take as the one that is true, and &quot;the softer
</I>&gt;<i> interpretation&quot; as false?
</I>
Why do you consider it OK to ignore a license just because it  
inconveniences you? Do you hold the same view regarding things you  
create?

&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, with the amount of people who have expressed their concerns  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the Windows version it shouldn't take that long to develop a proper,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> legally unambiguous solution to this problem rather than trying to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hack
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> around it rather than just complaining.
</I>&gt;<i> Again - not everyone here is a developer, there are many users here,  
</I>&gt;<i> who
</I>&gt;<i> just wish OpenOCD to be what is was, not another Uber-GPL code for  
</I>&gt;<i> l33t
</I>&gt;<i> users.
</I>
Everyone who uses OpenOCD is a developer in some capacity. Like all  
community software, development happens on a voluntary basis. If you  
want something done you must be prepared to either do it yourself or  
hire someone to do it. Look at it as an opportunity to learn some new  
skills.

Regards,
Anders
