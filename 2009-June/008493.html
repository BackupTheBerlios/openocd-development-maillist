&gt;<i> There is no problems in using GPL code together with GPL+exception code. 
</I>&gt;<i> Combining all of that with with code under some third license depends on 
</I>&gt;<i> a number of things. Again, see the GPL FAQ.
</I>
When GPL needs an exception that means that some &quot;code under some third 
license&quot; is used. I just can't see many opportunities to use an 
exception other than using some closed-source libraries... That's the 
case we're discussing here.

&gt;<i> Right, but section four says &quot;You may not copy, modify, sublicense, *or* 
</I>&gt;<i> distribute the Program&quot; (emphasis added). If it just concerned 
</I>&gt;<i> distribution then there would be no room for interpretation.
</I>
Still I don't see that as a distribution. The patch by itself is 
WORTHLESS it needs an executable, moreover - a RIGHT executable. If I'd 
wrote an article which would say sth like &quot;open the .exe in hex-editor, 
find 0x1234 and replace with 0x5678&quot; would that be distribution too? 
That article is a &quot;longer form&quot; of a patch. If that's distribution, than 
OpenOCD's manual says how to build OpenOCD with the incriminated library 
- is it violating the GPL too? This is geting way too extreme.

&gt;<i> Why do you consider it OK to ignore a license just because it 
</I>&gt;<i> inconveniences you? Do you hold the same view regarding things you create?
</I>
Why do you consider it OK to overinterpret the license just because it 
inconveniences you? In things I create I take the pragmatic view - when 
something is given for free (like the ftd2xx.dll library) than it is 
meant to be used, for free - I'm not creating artificial problems that 
would prevent me to use that &quot;something&quot;.

&gt;<i> Everyone who uses OpenOCD is a developer in some capacity.
</I>
Perfectly true, but you agree that using USB on Windows in C++ is not 
very much like writing code for bare-metal ARM7 in ANSI-C? Yes - both of 
those are &quot;programming&quot;...

&gt;<i> Look at it as an opportunity to learn some new
</I>&gt;<i> skills.
</I>
I'd love to, but I'm affraid that before I'd do anything Windows 7 will 
be very much out-dated. The problem is that a solution (a good 
solution!) is required now, not in months or years.

4\/3!!
