Dang, Rick.  This is very disappointing, and I apologize for
contributing to the arguments that caused your dismay.  The dismay has
been mutual, on occasions, but no hard feelings ever survived them on my
part.  Indeed, I would still enjoy discussing these issues over beer in
the future.

&gt;<i> I relinquish all my claims of copyright on the OpenOCD code base and

If it is your decision to leave the project, then I wish you well too,
but I wish you would reconsider and stick through it.  Your voice has
been valued, and your contributions would be missed. 

If you do decide that you must leave, then the community should be
assured that I will work to ensure the 0.2.0 release will be delivered.

Cheers,

Zach
