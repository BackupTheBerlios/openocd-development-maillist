While this is fine (it's not different with me, else I would help more 
;) ), I think we could try to improve dealing with this situation:

Sorry, but it's my personal impression from one or two discussions 
that the way we deal at the moment with this is &quot;OMAP3 is broken, I 
don't understand it, add even stronger error messages that everybody 
knows it&quot;.

Well, we already know ;)

I would vote to do instead:

- Tell exactly what is broken (from a technical point of view, maybe 
on a level a not so experienced OpenOCD engineer could understand, too 
;) ). Example from this script: &quot;endstate command probably didn't do 
what the script writers expected anyway&quot;. Why not better use two 
sentences explaining the potential technical problem seen?

- Instead of spending time implementing even stronger error messages, 
better spend the time in discussion or detailed description how to fix 
the broken stuff.

&gt;<i> so
</I>&gt;<i> I'll await specific feedback. 
</I>
This is fine. But in the starting point of this thread there wasn't a 
question for feedback. It was &quot;because I have no idea what the script 
expected that command to do I disable it&quot;.

And, if others like to help with missing information (see above &quot;what 
do you like to know?&quot;) the answer is &quot;I have no time&quot;. Again, that's 
fine, but if the answer for people trying to help is &quot;I have no time&quot;, 
this doesn't seem to really work.

&gt;<i> I just know that the endstate command
</I>&gt;<i> was broken in seven different ways.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There was a discussion on the many shortcomings of ir/drscan
</I>&gt;<i> commands. Also there isn't(I don't think) a pathmove/statemove
</I>&gt;<i> command, which I can easily imagine is necessary too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I believe is required to get OMAP up and running is:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - a good OpenOCD engineer dedicating enough time at the problem. 
</I>
 From my point of view Magus is a good candidate for this. So seems we 
already have one :)

&gt;<i>There
</I>&gt;<i> are plenty of those around, but nobody who currently has the
</I>&gt;<i> motivation to
</I>&gt;<i> address all the problems and install OMAP into his brain.
</I>&gt;<i> - clean up &amp; support the ir/drscan commands + add pathmove/statemove
</I>&gt;<i> commands
</I>&gt;<i> - create a way to robustely execute sequences that do not get bowled over
</I>&gt;<i> by background polling
</I>&gt;<i> - use all of the above to write robust configuration scripts
</I>
Anyway, let's go on with Magnus' answer to this (see other mail).

Best regards

Dirk
