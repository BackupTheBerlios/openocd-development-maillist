I believe this would be illegal circumvention of the GPL. 

For these kinds of machinations to be acceptable, the &quot;dummy&quot; library
needs to actually function in a comparable manner; that would mean
implementing a full wrapper for libftdi using the FTD2XX APIs.

Otherwise, you would be distributing a binary version of OpenOCD for the
express purpose of it being linked to the proprietary FTD2XX drivers.
You really would not be doing anything different, and I would object
strenuously to this approach.  I seriously doubt it would be legal.

As far as I am concerned, you are looking for a way to maintain your
status quo, and I understand your desire to do so.  Honestly, any form
of working dummy library pisses me off, but there may be nothing that I
can do about it (assuming it was done properly).  Well, I suppose that I
can state that I would never commit it to the repository myself.

Regardless, your unwillingness to contribute to a good solution -- one
that would be acceptable to its major contributors -- undermines my
perception of your open source integrity and that of your business.

Be advised: I am starting to visualize torches and pitchforks.  I am
actually surprised that no one has posted links to these threads on a
popular aggregation site; this kind of situation is chum in the water
for real GPL sharks.  You will quickly find that I am very reasonable
when compared to such extremists.

Cheers,

Zach
