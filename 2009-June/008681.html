This is _very_ apt observation, and one I almost forgot myself.

&gt;<i> To stay on topic, following this (FSF approved) interpretation of GPL

</I>
As (I think) you say here, the Linux kernel module scenario does not
affect the legality of a loadable module in the same user-space process
as OpenOCD.  The module still violates the GPL when distributed, since
it would be derived in part from the type and API definitions provided
by the driver interface header files.  Thus, binaries of the driver
module could not be distributed.

However, I have mentioned that modular drivers could allow a build-kit
to only produce that single driver from source, though the &quot;build&quot;
requirements still get out of control.  The latest &quot;link-kit&quot; idea would
be perfect for this though!  Modular drivers are still a Good Thing.

Cheers,

Zach
