Just like me [;

&gt;<i> 1) Why do you initialize the FT_Close_ptr and FT_Purge_ptr in a 
</I>&gt;<i> different place then all the others? Isn't it cleaner to keep all the 
</I>&gt;<i> initializations together?
</I>
As a trV embedded engineer I've saved some memory [; Keeping all 
together would be clearer, but I decided to minimise the number of 
globals and:
1. read() and write() are global, as these are used all the time
2. in ft2232_init() I initialize above two globals and functions that 
are used only once in ft2232_init()
3. as close() and (probably?) purge() are not used very frequently, I 
initialize theirs function pointers there - locally.

This way there are only 3 globals (hangle + 2 fn pointers)

Anyone can tell me whether my assumption about ft2232_purge_ftd2xx() is 
correct? If that is called often, than I'll make a global pointer for 
FT_Purge...

&gt;<i> 2) Isn't it possible to define a macro function for the FT_xxx functions 
</I>&gt;<i> in case of FTD2XX_DYNAMIC? Something like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> #if FTD2XX_DYNAMIC == 1
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> #define FT_Close( handler ) (*FT_Close_ptr)( handler )
</I>&gt;<i> /* same for all other functions */
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> #endif
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This way you don't have to add ifdef's around all function calls and 
</I>&gt;<i> it'll make the patch smaller and less possibilities for mistakes in the 
</I>&gt;<i> future.
</I>
That would be very cool, but you'd get milions of errors like 
&quot;FT_Whatever redefined, previous definition was Somewhere&quot;, because the 
definitions of FT_Whatever() is in the header which has to be included, 
as there are many required constants (like FT_OK) and typedefs (like 
FT_STATUS) there.

After the whole series of patches (everything loaded dynamically on all 
platforms), there won't be so many #ifs &lt;: I tried to make my changes an 
addition rather than modification - this way I'm pretty sure that this 
patch won't break anything else.

4\/3!!
