You are doing it to circumvent the GPL.  I think that is illegal.

You would be contravening this copyright holder's intention, which would
make you liable for any possible infringement that I could show. 

Furthermore, I think individuals can be held liable for &quot;inducing&quot;
infringement, which is where IANAL becomes useful in some respects.

I have been repeatedly warning _against_ infringement and to consult
with an attorney on any possible solutions that you intend to distribute
in binary form.  You should be too.

&gt;<i> -  FTDI ?   no their libray and driver is called in accordance with 
</I>&gt;<i> their documentation.
</I>&gt;<i> - OpenOCD ?  nobody has touched a single line of OpenOCD code
</I>&gt;<i> - Copyright holders of libftdi, Intra2Net AG ?  no,  libftdi is LGPL and

</I>&gt;<i> section 3.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would  it work? with a bit of tweaking I would think so.

</I>&gt;<i> Is this a blatant attempt just to work around the problems with OpenOCD, 
</I>&gt;<i> GPL and libftd2xx ?  What do I know ? Maybe yes, but that does not make

</I>
It might.  This is a very gray area.  For the love of all that is sane,
why do you want to keep pressing these fronts, when other options have
been presented that will solve the problems without any objections?

Cheers,

Zach
