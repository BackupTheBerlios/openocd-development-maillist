<PRE>PART DUEX
==========

To understand this - please - read my earlier thread:  &quot;Target AJAX like 
support - User Interface Thread&quot;.

This thread discusses the &quot;command ideas&quot;.
The user interface part is in the earlier thread.

What ever we do - we need to come up with a Nifty Protocol name for this 
part, some name that is utterly silly or socially offensive.

-Duane.

===============

I will repeat my self, this point is UTTERLY important that we get this 
API correct - otherwise we will screw this feature up big time.
I cannot recommend this GOOGLE TECH TALK - enough

SENDING COMMANDS
===============

The tiny server supports
    HTTP post, and HTTP GET, those are probably enough for our purposes.
    Lets assume those 2 methods are plenty.

=================
RECEIVING REPLIES
=================

Today, we have a TCL command server.  That can continue easily enough.

But I want to verify that this is *STILL* a good solution.
    I cannot judge from the stand point of AJAX,  FLASH, and JAVA, which 
is better.

To what degree can they open a socket and talk to it? is this utterly easy?
Or is the answer something else:   &quot;They can, but it is painful, it is 
easier if we do some type of &quot;XHTML&quot; requests instead?

My understanding of AJAX comes from this:
    <A HREF="http://www.brainjar.com/dhtml/ajax/default.asp">http://www.brainjar.com/dhtml/ajax/default.asp</A>

Let us assume the server *CANNOT* easily respond with XML..
Can we choose another format that is simple and easy to parse?

Most if not all commands need to return data in some &quot;name/value&quot; type 
format that is extendable and easy to parse.
I am ignoring the transport scheme, pending resolution of the above).

Using the &quot;version number request&quot; - (below) as an example, the element 
names (or tag-names) might be:

    protocol-version:   123
    svn-version: 456
    sign-on-string: &quot;The fancy new openocd version 1.2.3 built by 
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">duane at borgcube</A> on 2009.06.03&quot;

XML is another idea. JSON is another.  Simple ASCII text, as shown above 
is also very simple, in effect, the reply data component looks like 
http-headers (on purpose).

I cannot judge how easy it is for any of these common web-script 
languages do the majic they do. I would like input from others about this.

=====================
Minimal Commands:
=====================

(a)   What version are you

    Reply is multi-part
          (1) the protocol version number
          (2) the SVN version number
          (3) the sign on string OpenOCD gives @ startup.

=====================
(b)  What are the list of targets.
=====================

    Reply is the list of names supplied to 'target create'

=====================
(c)  What are the list of taps?
=====================

    Reply is the list of names supplied to 'jtag newtap'

=====================
(d)  There should be *NO* concept of &quot;active tap&quot;, nor &quot;active target&quot;
=====================

   In all cases, all command should *require* a specific target or tap 
name be specified

=====================
(d)  For any target, or tap, or board
=====================

   A means to get *details* about the target or tap, or board
   Using the TAPNAME, the TARGETNAME, or ?something? as a key.

   In general, this &quot;details&quot; request should be redirected to a *static* 
pre configured
   file, perhaps a *JSON* file, for example, the request URL might be:

                
<A HREF="http://localhost:6666/openocd/static/chipatmel/at91sam9260/memory.json">http://localhost:6666/openocd/static/chipatmel/at91sam9260/memory.json</A>

   (See the 'static meta-data files' in my earlier thread).

==============================
(e) The ability to read the value of some TCL variables.
==============================

    For example, assume I have a TARGET name in my Javascript.
    That target name might be:   &quot;at91sam9260.cpu&quot;

    Return the &quot;details&quot; file for this target. [see above]

===============================
(f) The ability to read/write memory
===============================

     In effect, where one can specify the *width* of the access.

           target_read_memory()
     And target_write_memory().

================================
(g) CPU Registers  (specifically GDB registers)
================================

    The ability to get the *NAMES* of the CPU registers.
        This might come from a &quot;cpu-reg-names.json&quot; file.

    The ability to *read* and *write* those registers.

    I'd hope this would use a common viewer sheme.

================================
(h) The ability to read &quot;special cpu registers&quot;
================================

    For example ARM &quot;cp15&quot; - is not a GDB register.

    These might be a *special-register-viewer* file.
 
====
It is late, that is the idea I've had in mind for +1 year
And is probably good &quot;food for thought&quot; for now.
