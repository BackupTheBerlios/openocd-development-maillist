</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Such a redundancy wouldn't be great, but relying on target_name ==

</I>&gt;<i> to lots of strange things.  Imagine a single TAP that has the debug  
</I>&gt;<i> registers for two separate target types.  You can't have 2 targets   
</I>&gt;<i> with the same name even though they use the same TAP.  
</I>
I had imagined that, but realized that since we don't have any such
monstrosity today, we could defer that issue until later if we wanted
to go the simpler &quot;require $TAPNAME == $TARGETNAME&quot; route.  :)


&gt;<i> 		 Of course, the  
</I>&gt;<i> 'target $target_name isenabled' isn't always a direct translation to  
</I>&gt;<i> checking if the TAP is enabled.  There could easily be some other set  
</I>&gt;<i> of items within the target's registers that determine if it is  
</I>&gt;<i> enabled.  In the simple case, it can be implemented as just looking up  
</I>&gt;<i> the tap name and asking the JTAG layer if the tap is enabled.  A more  
</I>&gt;<i> complex case would likely always check if the TAP is enabled and then  
</I>&gt;<i> perform other checks.  I can see value in a general &quot;target is  
</I>&gt;<i> enabled&quot; command.
</I>
Again, we don't have such cases today.  We can speculate all kinds
of things, but in the absence of real hardware I don't think the
results of speculation are compelling.  Plus, &quot;$target_name curstate&quot;
has a very limited range of state outputs, and it would need to grow
to accomodate such states.

The IEEE 1149.7 stuff seems to incorporate a &quot;tap state&quot; model of
sorts ... parts relevant to OpenOCD would be the power states, and
whether it's routed into the scan chain or not.  I'd say those use
cases are relatively &quot;near future&quot;.  Not so with &quot;target state&quot;.


&gt;<i> &gt; Another is to avoid the nastiness inherent in the current capability
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of running &quot;target configure -chain-position foo.bar&quot; *after* the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; target has been set up.  I can't ever see goodness coming from that...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yup.  We definitely should partition things into init-time settings  
</I>&gt;<i> and run-time settings.  There are a number of things that really  
</I>&gt;<i> should only be set on target (or tap) creation.  Imagine someone  
</I>&gt;<i> trying to change the width of the TAP IR at runtime.
</I>
Part of why that's not allowed.  :)

It's the target stuff that's goofy that way, not TAP stuff.

 
&gt;<i> &gt; That is, it would help keep the layer distinction:  there's a TAP
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; layer, and a target layer.  TAP operations don't work on targets,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and vice versa.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (Some TAPs are isomorphic to targets too, and in the simplest systems
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there may be only one tap == a target.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right.  I don't think our command structure today does a very good job  
</I>&gt;<i> of keeping them separate or distinguishing which layer a command is  
</I>&gt;<i> part of.  If we group the TAP commands under the 'jtag' command and  
</I>&gt;<i> target commands under the 'target' command, it is _much_ clearer.
</I>
So to get back to the real &quot;it's *BROKEN* and 0.2.0 needs a fix&quot;
issue ... sounds like you would be happier with

	$target_name tapname

command to return the TAP, so the startup.tcl loops would look
something like

	if { [jtag tapisenabled [$t tapname]] == 0 } {
		continue
	}

or something similar, instead of assuming the target is enabled.

Yes?

And fixing &quot;$target_name configure ...&quot; so it disallows changing the
target position or endianness after target setup.
