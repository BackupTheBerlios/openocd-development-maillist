</I>
No. That may be your other device. I think the FTDI device will
show as a single USB composite device (parent) and two separate
device (child) in device manager. You need to replace them with
a single libusb-win32 device driver.

If your system has other USB composite device, leave them
as it is. You do not want to disturb them.

&gt;<i> That will allow the serial port to work on the olimex (and
</I>&gt;<i> the jtag functionality to continue).
</I>
No. By using libusb-win32 device driver as the driver for
the Olimex device instead of FTDI driver, you will lost the
serial port.

&gt;<i> However, if I plug in, say, a usb
</I>&gt;<i> memory stick or my usb camera (mass storage) or a printer it will not be
</I>&gt;<i> seen since the driver is replaced by libusb.
</I>
As I said above, you should not do that. You only need to
replace the FTDI driver for your Olimex device (or other Jtag
device based on FT2232x).

&gt;<i> Am I anywhere close to understanding what this means?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Losing the ability to have USB mass storage (or a printer) is kind of
</I>&gt;<i> bad, if I understand what you are saying.
</I>
No you do not need to do that. I am just giving an example.
You will not lose USB mass storage or printer function.

&gt;<i> I assume, also, that you don't have these limitations with the
</I>&gt;<i> proprietary ftd2xx driver?
</I>
Right. That is the &quot;native&quot; driver for the FTDI device. We normally
would like to use the native driver and native API if that is possible.
For example, for pk2cmd, we use native HID API under Windows
and Mac OS X to access HID device. Under Linux, we use
libusb as the Linux hid device driver is not so efficient to deal
with the PICkit 2 (not a real Human Interface device). It is
possible to use libusb-win32 for Windows and libusb for
Mac OS X for PICkit 2. But we think it is not a very good way
since the user needs to do some extra things. It is not a very
pleasant user experiences for those users. And it will come
back to bite the developers.

That is why I think to go for FTDI device driver and FTD2XX library
is the nature choice. But now there is this GPL complication.
