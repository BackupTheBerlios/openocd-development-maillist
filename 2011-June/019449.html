<PRE>Hi all!

The recent activity surrounding the ft2232 driver makes it obvious that
there are lots of bugfixes and structural improvements that need to be done.
Unfortunately, trying to understand the code or even just browsing around in
it is complicated by the fact that its cluttered with functions related to
the different layouts.

I plan to break out all the layout specific code to a separate file, making
the remaining core ft2232 code easier to work with. The question is, what's
a suitable interface between the layout functions and the core ft2232
functions?

As a matter of fact I made the separation one and a half years ago, but
never got around to completing the patchset. At the time, everything the
layout functions required from the core ft2232 code boiled down to appending
to the ft2232 command buffer. Pretty clean and probably a suitable
interface, assuming things haven't changed too much.

The black sheep, now and then, is the signalyzer layout. Its layout
functions uses the ftd2xx API directly, requiring access to the ftdi handle
and probably a bunch of other data. Many functions are unimplemented for
libftdi. It is also an exercise in code duplication with lots of repetitive
snippets of code. Trivial refactoring could reduce the number of lines by
half or so.

Questions to this list:

1) Since this means moving a lot of code around, it's prudent to ask if
anyone have ongoing work that could interfere with a change like this.

2) Any thoughts on the interface between the layout functions and the core
ft2232 code?

3) What to do with the signalyzer code? I have no idea what this interface
is. Is it used at all? Should we adapt 2) to its requirements or let it
remain in ft2232.c? Maybe split it out to a completely separate driver, if
it's so different?

/Andreas
