2 release is quite good. 4 release will be wonderful if there are
enough changes or bug fixes. I think it is not necessary
if there are not enough changes to justify 4 release. 6-release
may be too aggressive for a project like OpenOCD due to
limit resources (unless more maintainers and volunteers
jump in).

I am looking forward to seeing the OpenOCD 0.5 release.
At least Peter Stuge will have one less reason to argue
for his idea that not-release-forever project is still active. :-)

Peter Stuge's idea about release and what is an active project.
&quot;If none works on code then a project is inactive.
Activity = anything happens.
Activity != releases happen.

You and Xiaofan seem to agree with me that OpenOCD is an active
project. As you know, OpenOCD has gone longer than libusb without
a release.&quot;

Of course he has a point but I hope most of the project admins
not to follow his ideas about release. Release is not that
expensive -- so it should be done once in a while. Release is
not too cheap (if project is complex enough or with limited resources)
-- so it should be done not that often.
