If this is really how things look that is bad.

I like to rebase my libusb repo, which makes it difficult to see if
the last change was a small commit message fix or ten hours of
analysis and code rework. Suggestions to make work more visible are
most welcome.

I've always communicated that my libusb repo is the proposed merge
queue for libusb.git. Keeping it there was probably a mistake, it
will become a testing branch in libusb.git instead, so it's more
visible.

I still offer to add libusb repos for anyone and everyone who wants
one, since even before I was maintainer, sadly without many takers. :\


&gt;<i> action needs to be taken by the maintainer...
</I>
I've found that our views often differ fundamentally. I think this
may be one more instance of that. The perception of maintainer is
curious.

I haven't contributed in great numbers to OpenOCD, yet I was still
asked to be a maintainer.

I explained that I don't have much time and that I will not likely
be able to increase my level of contribution to OpenOCD, but &#216;yvind
and Spencer were still interested.

This reinforces my belief that the *what* is more important than the
*how much*, ie. level of involvement.

I am of course honored by &#216;yvind and Spencer having considered me,
and I will continue to do what I have done so far; try to help when
I can.


&gt;<i> condemning the libusb project to a slow death...
</I>
&gt;<i> Peter being able to afford the level of involvement that is
</I>&gt;<i> expected from a project maintainer has really been at the crux
</I>
Maybe the expectations are also a factor.

If noone works on code then a project is inactive. At least you, I,
Sean and Hans have worked on the libusb code over the last month, so
I think libusb is still active, actually maybe more widely active
than ever.


To finally come back on topic :) I also don't think that OpenOCD is
anywheree near dying. There's a lot of active development going on,
and I'm excited to continue to be a part of it!


Many thanks, and kind regards

//Peter
