I agree with this one. I think OpenOCD is better in this aspect
since there are more maintainers. So there is nothing lost if a
maintainer disappears (kind of glad that Zach Welsh is now gone),
the project can still progress quite well.

To be honest, Peter has done a lot and contributed a lot to
the libusb project. The community certainly recognized the
contribution. So we were actually quite happy when Daniel Drake
made him a maintainer. Unfortunately the community now largely
agree that he is not up to the expectation of the community
as a maintainer.

Reference:

Peter wants to keep very tight control of everything and he is very cautious
about changes.  But he doesn't have the time for that. He also puts
too much emphasis on things like git/trac which are important but
should not trumpet the proper going of a project. He has also a strange
idea that no release is actually okay for open source projects. Basically
he wants a perfect release and would like to release if something is
not perfect according to his ideas. However, we all know that nothing
is perfect...

In the end, I think he can be a good fit for OpenOCD where there
are more active maintainers.
