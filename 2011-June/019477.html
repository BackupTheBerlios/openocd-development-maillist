Yes.

I'm happy for Peter here, and while I apologize for the intrusion as 
well as the opinion I am about to provide on matters that are clearly 
unrelated to OpenOCD, for those who want some clarification as to what 
Xiaofan means above, let me provide some insight with regards to what 
has been happening with another project, that Peter is also a maintainer 
of.

For those who don't know, Peter has now been the _sole_ maintainer of 
the libusb project [1] for about 9 months, a project that is perhaps as 
widely used as OpenOCD (if not more), is both experiencing and requiring 
new developments, and has been in _critical_ need of a release for about 
a year. With very old, well known and non risky fixes still not having 
been officialized, the libusb project has been getting complaints from 
our users left and right, yet, still no release appears to be on the 
horizon and Peter's involvement as a maintainer has mostly been limited 
to rebuilding his personal (i.e. non official) git branch every 3 months 
or so. Lately the project has even been qualified as &quot;one of the most 
disheveled projects (someone) had ever seen&quot;. Hardly something a project 
maintainer would want to put on their resume, and clearly an indication, 
if there was need for one, that action needs to be taken by the 
maintainer...

Yet, perusing various mailing lists shows that, whilst Peter seems to 
have plenty of time to get actively involved and take on demanding 
challenges in other multi-maintainers projects such as coreboot or this 
one, where his absence to tend to other matters could be very much 
excused, he still somehow manages to neglect the one project where there 
actually doesn't exist any other maintainer to take over, and in effect, 
and I am carefully weighing my words here, has been condemning the 
libusb project to a slow death...

Therefore, it comes as unsurprising that both Xiaofan and I, and most 
likely other libusb contributors and users, are a bit flabbergasted by 
this latest announcement, since Peter being able to afford the level of 
involvement that is expected from a project maintainer has really been 
at the crux of the libusb controversy over the past few months...

All I can hope then, while yet again congratulating Peter on his new 
maintainer position, is that, unlike what is happening with libusb right 
now, he will _genuinely_ be interested in performing his maintainer 
activities for OpenOCD, and that his actions, or lack thereof, will not 
cause a repeat of the disarray that has befell on the libusb project.

Regards,

/Pete
