<PRE>Hi,

It's been a long time since I built openocd (0.3.0), I used to build with 
mingw64 and it worked fine, I've tried today to get the latest and build it 
under the same environment I used before and I get some errors. So I have a 
couple of questions...

The fist problem I get is in the &quot;Jim&quot; stuff. It can't link on my system 
with wsock32 so I replaced this with the mingw64 version that I thought 
would replacement it. All the obvious external references are resolved 
except for &quot;__WSAFDIsSet&quot;. I can't appear to find this anywhere in the 
libraries I have.

1) Anyone else attempting to build using mingw64 and have any gems of 
wisdom?
2) Is it possible to build without Jim so I can come back to this problem 
another day?

Perhaps I need to do a lot of reconfiguring of my build environment for the 
latest version but I though I would ask anyhow in case anyone is building on 
Windows x64 and has any advice.

Thanks,

Liam Redmond.
