Just my 2 cents:

This sounds like a bad idea to me if I understand right. It means the
release versions will always be in branches that either do, or don't,
get merged back into master.

If they don't get merged back in, then future releases are not direct
descendants of older releases. That is not good for history review or
trying to understand where a bug comes in, you can't bisect between
version n and n+1.

If they do get merged in then you end up with messy history and again
difficult to bisect and isolate problems if something breaks when
merging in the release version.

I would suggest better would be to do all releases from master in a
linear fashion, going into feature freeze as needed. At the close of
a merge window new development would continue on another branch,
&quot;next&quot; or &quot;staging&quot; or whatever. After tagging and releasing, the
development branch would be rebased onto the master, giving a linear
history.

I think this is more or less how other projects including Linux do it.
It takes a bit more thought and familiarity with git but results in
a much cleaner more usable history.
