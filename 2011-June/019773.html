</I>&gt;<i> The best is to standardize at a lower level ... and to forget the idea to have the possibility to bitbang from the TCL of the openocd.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;/
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/That's as for the SWD, we have to standardize some function call in the ft2232, and avoiding bitbang access from higher-level.
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/That's not simple to dev, but safe for end-user.
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/
</I>&gt;<i> /It is necessary to expose the feature though TCL.  Otherwise it is not possible to use it as the telnet TCL interface is the primary (only?) way for you to control OpenOCD.  Furthermore, this is the interface to use if you want to use OpenOCD from another program.

</I>Hi,

Please do not confuse. I am not talking about to remove the TCL itself, 
but I talking to avoid the possibility to bitbang the ft2232 port from 
TCL in a non safe way ! It is really not the same.
Please read all my comments.

The bitbang of the ft2232 via TCL MUST pass via a filter in the ft2232.c 
associated to the layout. The filter must mask the ft2232 inputs related 
to the layout. The filter must apply the mask when the bitbang try to 
write these ft2232 input.

If this mechanism is integrated in ft2232.c by Tomek, then yes, and only 
in this case we can bitbang the ft2232 via TCL user interface.

If Tomek want to provide the bitbang from TCL, he must first provide the 
filter mechanism . Actually the filter bitbang filter mechanism is not 
implemented in  ft2232.c .

That's all.

Again, what happen if the RTCK input is driven low or high from TCL 
bitbang, by the end-user. You have lot of chance to break he ft2232 or 
the buffer (between the ft2232 and the target) or the target, since you 
have chance to generate a short-circuit of the RTCK wire ;-( . That's 
the same for all the ft2232 Input . That's why I have write a big 
DANGEROUS !
&gt;<i> I do not understand the opposition to making OpenOCD more flexible by reducing the need to modify the source and re-building to achieve some functionality.  You can already do plenty of &quot;unsafe&quot; things with OpenOCD like erasing the entire flash of your target.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I am not opposed to make the OpenOCD more flexible. But I do not want to 
see OpenOCD as dangerous for the hardware signal/wire for the target 
and/or the adapter. Yes, we can do &quot;unsafe&quot; things with OpenOCD. But the 
actual unsafe thing are not related to the JTAG / SWD hardware / signal 
/ wire, but related to the how we use upper debug protocol and that's 
really not the same.
