</I>&gt;<i> I am struggling a bit following the above, but I think we agree:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - development goes on in master like it always has done
</I>&gt;<i> - you create a fork at the openocd mirror and create a release branch there.
</I>&gt;<i> You pick whatever you want from the master branch or whatever patches
</I>&gt;<i> posted that you think should go in and generally run the release cycle.
</I>in my point of view each need at least the Acked-by of SOB of one Maintainer
at least
as we need to trace who ack and apply what

As done in the kernel people that write the patch need to put there sob
Maintainer that apply to patch the sob too
Maintainer or people that ack a need the Acked-By in the commit
If someone test Tested-By
if someone review Reviewed-By

the key point is to trace the patch work flow
&gt;<i> - once you're done with the release, I pull it from you and push it to
</I>&gt;<i> the official openocd repository.
</I>I think it will be good that the development tree will not be the official
release tree.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The advantage of this approach is that we can work independently
</I>&gt;<i> and that you can get started today, we both have everything we need.
</I>&gt;<i> For intrusive and dangerous changes, we should synchronize, but most
</I>&gt;<i> changes to OpenOCD are small these days. Tomek's work excepted...
</I>So we officialized this
before Sunday you send me the official pull request for the 0.5.1-rc1

and then until the next merge window only fix pull request can be send to me
or pull request for the next branch for the next merge window

I'll send an e-mail every rc and release

but it will be good to have a list of maintainer that can send such kind of
request with the area they are responsible of

if possible a MAINTAINER file as done in the linux kernel

Best Regards,
J.
