</I>&gt;<i> /If our ft2232.c patches are not merged quickly, Amontec Team will certainly
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ come with a new specific jtagkey.c API driver  instead of the ft2232.c JTAG
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ driver.
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ The advantage with a specific Amontec JTAGkey API driver in openocd, will be
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ to see our patches merged in the minute, instead to wait 1 to 2 months ...
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ also the ft2232.c will still be usable for the JTAGkey.
</I>&gt;<i> /
</I>&gt;<i> This is the solution, you will have your own driver to manage then :-)
</I>&gt;<i> But you will then create another DRIVER not API as the interface API
</I>&gt;<i> is already set :-)
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Yes, a specific jtagkey driver with a wrapper for the existing openocd 
API ! Yes, that's the idea.
The user will be able to use the classic ft2232.c or the specific 
jtagkey.c as a jlink.c!
Maybe that's the road to follow if our patches take so long time to be 
merged on ft2232.c.
&gt;<i> I think project needs more support in cleanup and maintenance at the
</I>&gt;<i> moment, as there are some doubts on even more changing or complicating
</I>&gt;<i> existing code, creating your separate playground for testing new
</I>&gt;<i> features seems sensible. 
</I>You're right.
&gt;<i> Also if you want to make a release, make it
</I>&gt;<i> happen, do not expect other to do the job for you. Please note that
</I>&gt;<i> this is not against your ideas, the project simply needs to be cleaned
</I>&gt;<i> up and restructurized because it gets more and more complex with new
</I>&gt;<i> functionality that is still growing and can get out of control soon.
</I>
&gt;<i> This is all kept koherent by only one (?) person that does not take
</I>&gt;<i> money for all this time and effort to keep things organized.
</I>OpenOCD should accept more maintener, with different maintener right 
levels (layers).
But you are right, before doing this, the different layers should be 
reorganized in the way to accept new debug concepts.
&gt;<i>  This is
</I>&gt;<i> my personal opinion, maybe other people think different, but there
</I>&gt;<i> might be a point where new people won't be able to add new features at
</I>&gt;<i> all in sensible time soon. I can tell this as a new person here, it
</I>&gt;<i> took me few months to get familiar with the code. I expected things to
</I>&gt;<i> be more clear, readable and organized. Adding more complex code that
</I>&gt;<i> does no more than old simpler code is not a good developlment
</I>&gt;<i> practice. If you still only want to push things forward, create your
</I>&gt;<i> separate piece of code and experiment right there without affecting
</I>&gt;<i> general organization - I can understand this approach - if others dont
</I>&gt;<i> maybe creating working-copy fork for testing stuff is also a good
</I>&gt;<i> solution, git helps managing things like this and you have full source
</I>&gt;<i> code access. But then you would have to manage it yourself to see it
</I>&gt;<i> is not that trivial task as it might look/seems.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> To be on topic - on my FreeBSD box using libftdi it seems not to be
</I>&gt;<i> possible to use one configuration for all interfaces, it does not
</I>&gt;<i> work, there is a slight difference in ft2232_device_desc, but the
</I>&gt;<i> vid/pid is the same. Creating separate driver that can handle that on
</I>&gt;<i> multiple OS should do the job :-)
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>If you try an older openocd 06xx you will be able to open any jtagkey 
dongle via only the specific VID PID
The difference is what function from libftdi you use to open the device.
1. only by PID VID
2. by PID VID Description
3. by PID VID Serial Number
...
With older openocd version and with libusb libftdi, we open with 1. , 
and now we open with 2. . The 3. is used when serial number is present 
in the .cfg.

;-)
