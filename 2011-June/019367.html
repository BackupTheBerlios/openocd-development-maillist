<PRE>Hello Laurent,

Sorry if my comment seems not meritoric, I am not mentioning about
coding style because this leaves a lot to tell in case of all program
source tree. I am not advanced OpenOCD developer, I am learning code
internals for some time and I have some grasp on it already (enough to
recognize the function we are talking about without looking at the
code because I have already worked on it). Please take a look at my
explanation why I think this patch is not that good ant try to
convince me (maybe others?) that I am wrong :-)

1. The reason to propose this patch was improper error handling.
OpenOCD works in a manner where functions return ERROR_OK or
ERROR_FAIL, all additional/verbose information are provided by LOG_*
messages. This is also the case in ft2232_init(), so no need to
change. If you change this all other interfaces will behave different,
so the code gets dirty and unpredictable. This is a standard behavior
for all of the code.

2. The malloc() problem can be solved in a simple way as demonstrated
by my patch. No need to complicate things, no need to add other
functions that makes code less readable.

3. All interfaces have init() and quit() functions. If you change this
for one type of driver the code will get dirty as one drivers will
behave other than another interfaces. This should be avoided.

4. What is the real benefit of implementing/splitting open() and
init() for interface? Interface is a platform for further program
operation. Without interface program cannot work properly, so what
would you like to do with interface that is opened but
unusable/uninitialized? The current behavior is simple - interface
initialization failed, so will other things, retry or quit, don't go
futher. Interface init() checks if interface is connected and sets up
its state, this is enough for one function, why you want to split it?

5. There is a transport layer above interface, transport has select()
and init() - maybe this is the place you should place your code?
Transport select() function sets up interface and memory/registers for
transport internals, while transport init() can interrogate connected
targets (as the interface and transport are ready). Transport is
initialized automatically just after interface is initialized.

Long story short - there is already presented open/init mechanism at
transport layer, interface is only a platform for this to happen.
There is not much use of interface that is opened but unusable - this
is common for all interfaces, not only ft2232 - it is simply ready for
use or not.

There are more things to be fixed and changes in the OpenOCD internal
organization (i.e. program flow, global variables rewrite into common
context passed as function parameter, etc), but this should be done in
non-invasive, clean and rational manner. If we want to change
interface behavior, this change should apply to all interfaces. We
cannot allow one interface behave in other way than the others because
this will only bring confusion. The program flow is unclear enough to
complicate it even more right now. This is why I would freeze the
changes for a moment where general interface architecture will change
to become non-jtag-specific. Again please specify the benefits of
open() and init() for interface, and why it cannot happen in transport
layer as it is done right now.

About the (c) in the header fields I think that those should be
reserved for people that bring more than patching/rewrite but this is
a minor issue :-)

Best regards,
Tomek
