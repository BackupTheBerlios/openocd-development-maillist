exactly. producing smaller patches only complicates things...

no fear! i have commented my changes and code inside even doxygen
style so there is nothing hard to understand - changes are clean, does
not complicate existing code and the code is self explanatory and
commeted where necessary, as they should be :-) the problem itself
with understanding program flow or function operation may be the whole
program issue, not only my changes, as it took me few months to get
familiar with the code.. and i think it should be reorganized.. but as
you said - one thing at time - after we make swd working, maybe there
is time for code cleanup and refactorization (ie. fix program flow,
move globals into common context passed as function parameter, etc)
:<i>-)
</I>
if you prefer so, okay we can work on my fork for the moment swd if
operational, then i produce best patches possible, now i know how to
do this :-)

Best regards! :-)
