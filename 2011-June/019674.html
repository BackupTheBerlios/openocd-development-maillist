<PRE>Dear all

I'm submitting a change to the Cortex-M3 target which improves behavior 
of single stepping with interrupts.

Here's the description of the patch, hope you like it:



This patch extends the cortex_m3 maskisr command by a new option 'auto'.
The 'auto' option handles interrupts during stepping in a way they are
processed but don't disturb the program flow during debugging.

Before one had to choose to either enable or disable interrupts. The 
former steps into interrupt handlers when they trigger. This disturbs 
the flow during debugging, making it hard to follow some piece of code 
when interrupts occur often.

When interrupts are disabled, the flow isn't disturbed but code relying 
on interrupt handlers to be processed will stop working. For example a 
delay function counting the number of timer interrupts will never 
complete, RTOS task switching will not occur and output I/O queues of 
interrupt driven I/O will stall or overflow.

Using the 'maskisr' command also typically requires gdb hooks to be 
supplied by the user to switch interrupts off during the step and to 
enable them again afterward.

The new 'auto' option of the 'maskisr' command solves the above
problems. When set, the step command allows pending interrupt handlers 
to be executed before the step, then the step is taken with interrupts 
disabled and finally interrupts are enabled again. This way interrupt 
processing stays in the background without disturbing the flow of 
debugging. No gdb hooks are required.

The 'auto' option is the default, since it's believed that handling 
interrupts in this way is suitable for most users.

The principle used for interrupt handling could probably be used for 
other targets too.





Best Regards

Peter Horn
