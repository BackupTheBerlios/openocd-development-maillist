<PRE>Hi all,

	I'd like to propose the following release cycle

	For the people familiar with Linux kernel its basically the same

	2 development window:
	merge window
	fix window

	We will get 2 weeks of merge window where any code can be merge in the
	master branch. After will start the fix window of 6 weeks to stabilized
	the code. During the first week of the fix window reviewed patches that are
	not too much intrusive could be merged if they miss the merge window.
	Otherwise ONLY fix will be merge in the master branch.

	We will get 1 RC per week so 6 RC for each release. If the release is
	enough stable or need more time to be stabilized the fix window could
	reduced or extended based on the need.

	At the same time of the opening of the fix-window a next branch will be
	created where the new development will be done and will be merged at the
	beginning of the next merge window.

	At the same time of the opening of the merge window a stable branch
	will be created to accept ONLY bug fix a specific release.

	Specific work flow:
	If highly intrusive patch need to be merged they must go first during the
	merge window and must be present in the next branch for at least 2
	weeks.

	Release number scheme
	0.x.0 for the release
	0.x.0-rcx for the rc
	0.x.y for the stable branch

	as example the 0.5.0 release
	it will be 0.5.0-rc1 for the first RC
	0.5.0 for the release
	0.5.1 for the stable first release

	Next release plan:

	Merge window close this sunday 17th june
	relase 0.5.0 plan for the 29th July

Best Regards,
J.

</PRE>
