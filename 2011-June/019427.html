That requires adding a lot of brackets.

I'm all for gotos in error handling. In this simple case it wouldn't have
made things cleaner and the patch would have grown. Also I didn't want to
join the goto-vs-subfunction-flamewar-to-be, so a third option was
convenient. :) Main objection is that people are not very used to the comma
operator. I don't mind rewriting it using goto if the list feels that would
be preferred.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The patch uses code duplication and if statements inside the
</I>&gt;<i> cleanup fn(if (buffer) free(buffer)), which can be avoided using
</I>&gt;<i> exception handling and resource tracking. In the case of this patch,
</I>&gt;<i> it looks like the if (ft2232_buffer) free(ft2232_buffer) is a case
</I>&gt;<i> of &quot;conservative programming&quot;. I'd much rather have an assert
</I>&gt;<i> in this case than to have broken code &quot;auto-repair&quot; and be harder
</I>&gt;<i> to get right.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Duplication? Rather code reuse. Ok, the repeated calls to the cleanup
function (or the equivalent gotos, if you want to go that route) would have
disappeared using exception handling. But C doesn't have it, so...

The if statement was added to make ft2232_quit() a bit more generic so it
could be used for all cleanup cases, including the error case where malloc
fails. The alternative would have been to add a separate error handling path
for that case. And given how often error paths are exercised, it's safer to
keep them to a minimum.


&gt;<i> Note that I'm not holding off committing the patch for the above, as
</I>&gt;<i> maintainer I'm interested in progress as well as more philosophical coding
</I>&gt;<i> style discussions. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If someone does come forth with an even more cleaner patch, then
</I>&gt;<i> I'm OK with that. This is now growing into a case-study of how to formulate
</I>&gt;<i> a patch more than a fix. The openocd community has much to learn
</I>&gt;<i> about how to formulate patches.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As long as there is progress, I don't mind holding off the patch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I'm not in a hurry. There's a lot to do in the ft2232 driver. I have the
intention to perform some general cleanup in the near future, will post some
thoughts this evening maybe.
