<PRE>Hi Tomek,

for others to be able to review your work, it is essential
that it is a sequence of small logical changes. This will
also create a much greater degree of continuity in the
official master branch, which is very important to the
maintainers.

We also want to reorder your commits, so that we can
get all changes that are non-swd related pushed to
the master repository before we push any swd specific
changes.

For instance, we could probably move things into the
transport folder first and then you can rebase your
branch on top of the master branch.

Are you familiar with &quot;git remote add/rm&quot;? You can
have both the official and your git repository commits
in your local repository.

You probably want to delete all branches in your git
repository, except for the swd branch and then
continue to rebase your swd branch and forcing a
push of the updated swd branch as we move manage
to take out small parts of your work in commits that
we push to the master branch.

Can you summarise what kind of changes in your
branch that has nothing to do with swd as such and
could probably be out as separate
commits and committed to the master branch already?

Moving files into the transport folder seems like a good
candidate.
