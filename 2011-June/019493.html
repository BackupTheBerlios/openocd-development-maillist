It is. Heck, I only have to quote you on being &quot;confident that a release 
before 2011 (was) achievable&quot;, or Segher dismissing people like myself 
or Xiaofan as &quot;naysayer&quot; when we shared our pessimistic outlook about 
that statement, to make you realize that, by all accounts, even the 
libusb maintainer and &quot;acting maintainer&quot; should agree that the 
situation is bad, since they have arguably overextended their expected 
maximum release deadline by at least 6 months now...

It won't make our users, some how whom have probably been waiting for 
years now for patches to be integrated in official, any good to find out 
how great your personal git repo is. As you have stated many times in 
the past, our focus should be with providing our users with libusb 
packages that are attractive to them for their development. Fetching 
source from an ever rebased personal git repo, to be able to apply 
months (if not years) old _small_ fixes isn't.

&gt;<i> I like to rebase my libusb repo, which makes it difficult to see if
</I>&gt;<i> the last change was a small commit message fix or ten hours of
</I>&gt;<i> analysis and code rework. Suggestions to make work more visible are
</I>&gt;<i> most welcome.
</I>
Then, as many people have stated, please do this work in mainline, in 
bitesize operations, and please accept that applying corrective commits 
in mainline is not the end of the world. In the schoolyard of OSS 
projects, nobody is going to point the finger at us from not getting 
everything right at once, especially when we know that we are way behind 
schedule on a release.

It has also been suggested to you to try to break down the long awaited 
next release into small critical patches first (some of which, may I 
remind you, have been integrated into the mainline git for more than a 
year), and then move to more consequent items, but you have been adamant 
about trying to do everything at once.

When exactly are you going to realize that the approach you have been 
trying to follow is excessively detrimental to libusb users? If you have 
doubts about that statement, I suggest you re-read the numerous 
complaints on the libusb mailing-list. Myself and others have been 
trying to point that out to you for the best part of one year now, but 
you still seem to be acting like everything is OK.
Sorry to break it down to you, but it definitely isn't, so please come 
back to earth already, and do something that will actually benefit 
libusb users.

&gt;<i> I've always communicated that my libusb repo is the proposed merge
</I>&gt;<i> queue for libusb.git.
</I>
Yes, and that is not the problem. Having a merge queue with loads of 
commits, that never gets merged, or a mainline git tree with enough 
patches to warrant a release, that doesn't see one for months, is.

&gt;<i> I still offer to add libusb repos for anyone and everyone who wants
</I>&gt;<i> one, since even before I was maintainer, sadly without many takers. :\
</I>
Yes, let's add more individual repos. Exactly what we need here... I've 
had one, maybe 2 users for my 9 months old hotplug repo, despite the 
fact that this is a feature everybody wants, so I can tell you: adding 
more libusb repos does not help. What we need are timely releases of 
libusb, with the patches that have been submitted and validated for months.

&gt;&gt;<i> action needs to be taken by the maintainer...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've found that our views often differ fundamentally.
</I>
Unfortunately for you, I am only one of _many_ voicing concerns about 
your approach to libusb maintenance. I'm afraid it has long ceased to be 
a matter of conflicting views between two individuals... Have you asked 
Segher, Michael, Orin, Graeme or others what they thought about your 
release schedule lately?

&gt;<i> The perception of maintainer is curious.
</I>
Even more curious is the _lack_ of perception of a single maintainer, 
when _many_ project users have been complaining about the lack of 
releases...

&gt;<i> This reinforces my belief that the *what* is more important than the
</I>&gt;<i> *how much*, ie. level of involvement.
</I>
I'll take a maintainer that has to be shown the ropes, but that is 
effectively able to contribute time to a project, over a maintainer that 
supposedly knows the ropes but can't, any time.

If Linus came over and said he'd agree to be a libusb maintainer 
provided he can limit his contributions to 10 hours every 6 months, 
while somebody else came and said that, while he isn't that experienced, 
he is motivated enough and can devote the required amount of time to the 
project, then knowing full well that we have enough good people in our 
project to look over any maintainer's shoulders, I'd vote for the latter.

&gt;&gt;<i> condemning the libusb project to a slow death...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Peter being able to afford the level of involvement that is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expected from a project maintainer has really been at the crux
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe the expectations are also a factor.
</I>
Then PLEASE step down. If you can't be involved, then leave the position 
to people who will. If you want to exert control, but can't be bothered 
to spend the time required to exert the kind of control you want whilst 
still satisfying users, your only option is to peacefully step down.

&gt;<i> If noone works on code then a project is inactive. At least you, I,
</I>&gt;<i> Sean and Hans have worked on the libusb code over the last month, so
</I>&gt;<i> I think libusb is still active, actually maybe more widely active
</I>&gt;<i> than ever.
</I>
Someday you'll have to explain to us how a project that NEVER releases 
is active. Contributors are coding for users at large, not for a select 
group of people.

Regards,

/Pete

PS: Moving this thread to libusb-devel and CC'ing openocd-development, 
since this discussion is not directly related to OpenOCD.
