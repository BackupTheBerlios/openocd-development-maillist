<PRE>I wanted to see if anyone has any experience trying to upload the
AT91Bootstrap code into NAND flash for any of the AT91SAM9XXX parts (i.e.
AT91SAM9260, AT91SAM9G20, etc.) using OpenOCD?

I have tried erasing and programming the first block of the NAND flash in
every command combination possible with the image I have.  The programming
cycle is successful, the verify command is successful, but the internal
first stage boot ROM concludes that it isn't a valid image and goes limp (or
brain dead depending on how you want to look at it).  The Atmel startup
diagnostics from the internal boot code is naturally zero, so it is left to
wild imagination what the problem is.

Admittedly, this is the first project I have worked on that used NAND flash
and it is possible that my problem may be further compounded by a lack of
experience with these types of devices.  At this point, I would be happy if
someone has marched down this path before and can chime in with some advice.
I have spent several days trying to attack this problem without much
success.  At least on the surface it does not seem like this should be that
difficult.

Thanks,


Gary
