<PRE>Le 21/04/2010 21:07, Xiaofan Chen a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> 2010/4/22 Michel Catudal &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">michelcatudal at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Too many unknowns. OpenOCD can work under Windows. And I am
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sure VirtualBox's USB implementation is not the best (the same
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> for VMware, all of the USB implementation seems to be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> problematic by nature of emulation).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So just try out OpenOCD under Windows with libftdi and see if
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that helps. If yes, you can blame the VM.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am not sure that the problem lies in Virtual Box or VM. I have never
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> had any problem with USB support in either one.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I do use those only under Linux though. I would assume that the problem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> must be on the windows side.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe that is the case. Take note I am not a fan of using
</I>&gt;<i> VM. I am a OS neutral guy and I use Windows/Linux with
</I>&gt;<i> dual boot.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In any case, the point is that OpenOCD can work under
</I>&gt;<i> Windows and Linux with libftdi. So it is better for the OP to
</I>&gt;<i> try out OpenOCD without using the VM to debug the issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I know this to be a fact because I have been using the intrepid neovi
green and neovi blue with no apparent difference in both VirtualBox
under Mandriva Linux and under native Windows XP (at work).
I have also used J-Link with IAR ARM as well as the USB license dongle
for IAR and have had no issue with them. Even the Actia IME CAN tools
work well with both VM and VirtualBox

<A HREF="http://www.ime-actia.de/">http://www.ime-actia.de/</A> Raisonnance also works with VirtualBox.

As for VirtualBox under windows XP. It worked once for me, the day I
installed it. It would not boot anything after the next reboot so I took
it out. VMware does work but when I tried to get the embedded Linux
board from Actia City to connect to it, that didn't work. I use Ubuntu
9.04 in that VMware. At home I don't have any windows installation so
VMware or VirtualBox is the only way. For what I do I like it better.
The reason is that I only use windows when I have to. When I get home I
do not like to bring my work with me. When I do have to do work at home
I try to make it as painless as possible, meaning when I can do some on
Linux I do. It is beautiful with my new projects using the AVR32 since
there is good support on Linux. I haven't had to run windows at home for
at least 4 months. When I do some test with my CAN tools
I will have to but that is a few weeks away.
