Well, not obviously. To be clearer: I only ever saw the needing-replug sitution happen ONCE, on virtualbox linux, but I was banging pretty hard on it for a couple of days. I have however seen these random errors consistently on both platforms.

Since then I have also tested the latest GIT version under (virtual) linux, and also the latest git version build with FTDI's drivers instead of libftdi. All combinations show the same random errors. Also tried at a range of different JTAG clock speeds, makes no difference.

I am looking through documentation for other tuneables I can try fiddling with, and I have a logic analyer/scope arriving next week which might be of use. Should also get the DM355EVM before too long for comparison.

I am wondering things like:

- might it be some kind of earth problem? I am in Japan, the computer and DUT are all running off 2-pin power, no earths.

- some noise / inadequate power limitation of the JTAGKey-Tiny? Maybe I need a more manly JTAG adapter? That one's a bit of a stretch.. Just a shame I don't have an alternative here for comparison.

Pressin' and guessin',
