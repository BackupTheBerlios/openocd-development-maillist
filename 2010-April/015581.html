Not on this platform, but I have done things with NAND on another platform.

Maybe suggesting the obvious, but do you have any other way to program the NAND flash on this board, or a reference board (EVM?) with a known good flash image?
If you do, get that booting then read the flash back with OpenOCD and compare with what you managed to do, get so you can recreate it.

Also double-check boot config pin settings and all that other good hardware stuff.

Other than that, you can try debugging the bootloader that's trying to access the NAND flash (using OpenOCD + gdb). Good luck with that.
