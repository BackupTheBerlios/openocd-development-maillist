If anyone was curious, this seems (touch wood) to be OK now after building a new 14-20pin JTAG adapter ribbon with GND lines properly earthed at both ends, and reducing jtag_khz to 1000. 1500 gets intermittent faults.

I notice on the scope the TCK is really slow to rise, very slopey at 1MHZ, where RTCK is fairly nice and square. Not why, I'm not a hardware guy. Maybe the JTAGKey-Tiny is struggling to drive this board with an extra chip on the chain compared with the DM355EVM.
