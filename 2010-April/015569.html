<PRE>Hello,

at the moment I'm trying to get my Olimex LPC-E2294-8MB Board running 
with OpenOCD and GDB. Unfortunalty I had only very little success. I've 
compiled the current OpenOCD version from GIT with FTDI drivers. 
Everything worked well for the first time I start debugging with GDB 
(Version 6.8 and Version 7.0). But in a non-deterministic manner I get 
problems with stopping at breakpoints when starting the debug session 
and after pressing halt or stop I see that the debugger is halting in 
the data-abort handler. The strange behavior is, that the same code runs 
very well the first time and without any recompiling or code 
modification the debugger doenst work right and stops in data-abort 
handler. sometimes, after 5-8 trys it works again. But restarting the 
hardware and restarting openocd doenst change it. If I connect with 
telnet to openOCD it seems that every thing is working well. Checking PC 
and Stepping works and my code does not hang is the data-abort handler.

I would assume, the the code works well an no illegal memory reagion is 
accessed. After googling around the web I found this mailinglist thread 
form Michael Fischer 
<A HREF="../2008-May/002068.html">http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2008-May/002068.html</A> 
talking about a similar problem with LPC and GDB. But I'm not sure 
whether this could be the same or similar problem because the thread is 
from 2008 an OpenOCD has been developed further.

If some can give me some hints about this I would be very happy....I 
don't know what do to anymore.

Thanks

Beste regards
Andy
