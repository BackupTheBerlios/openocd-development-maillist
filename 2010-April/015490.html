I do not want to noise the mailing list at all. For sure.

What is the solution when a dongle is capable to up to 30Mhz or more, 
but the target do not support so much JTAG TCK frequency.
(I am talking after initialization of the chip, the PLL ...)
(In the particular case, PXA2xx are just not able to run at 30MHz)

Note : we have checked Amontec JTAGkey-2 and Amontec JTAGkey-2P at 30Mhz 
to program a Xilinx Spartan-6, so the JTAG frequency is depending first 
on the target TAP, then on the chain itslef, then on the capability of 
the dongle.

Also, please let me know why in a BSDL file ( Boundary Scan Description 
File ) the first attribute coming is  the max frequency of the TARGET TAP?
That's exactly what is missing in the jtag newtap of openocd ! The jtag 
newtap is really close to the definition of the BSDL files itself (I 
mean max frequency , ir length, idcode ...).
When creating a new jtag tap we should give the max frequency of the TAP 
(target specific). At the end of the jtag chain construction (or after 
each jtag newtap) we could check and found the smaller freq max of all 
tap. This will give us the theoretical max freq of the chain itself 
(JTAG daisy chain).  Then if the dongle (ex. the Amontec JTAGkey-2) is 
able to run over the max freq of the chain itslef we will limit the 
frequency automatically regarding the result of the freq max of the 
chain itself.
Without this mecanism, we will return to many custom .cfg -&gt; as at the 
begin of OpenOCD 2004 when we were running with only ONE .cfg !

One other solution could be to auto-detect the max frequency after 
adding a new tap, by checking the  IDCode of the TAP varying the 
frequency ! This could be a very nice solution (certainly the best 
solution), but not really easy to implement !
