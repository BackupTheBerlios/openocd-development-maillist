Well, many targets DO need to be halted to be able to probe the flash
and I agree that it would be nice with a solution to the GDB connect
problem in the general case. However, I don't see how it helps to
impose artificial restrictions to targets/flash drivers that are free
from such limitations. I believe such restrictions should be removed,
regardless of any general solution.

Besides, if we for some reason would want the target to always be
halted before a flash probe, shouldn't that be enforced in the generic
flash layer instead of in each individual driver?

&gt;<i> I would like a robust and simple solution. This is not a common problem,

I don't know, I somehow recall previous reports of this kind of
problem, earlier than Freddie's. And I suspect there's a vast number
of problems like this that never get reported, since people are
historically used to having random glitches and occasional
malfunction. Restarting GDB/OpenOCD is easier than reporting the bug.
For sure it's been a long-standing major annoyance at work with those
once-in-a-while failed loads. I just haven't found a cause until now
(there may be other as well).

&gt;<i> Did you consider adding target config script code to a pre connect
</I>&gt;<i> GDB event?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Such an event could reset init the target if the flash is not probe-able.
</I>
I did consider, but refrained for three reasons:
1. I couldn't find a reference to the available hooks in the
documentation, and I don't know them by heart. I'm sure I just didn't
look hard enough.
2. That would be somewhat of a workaround and I'd much rather see a
fix for the underlying problem.
3. It would probably make it impossible to connect to a running target
without stopping it, for the cases where it is desired.

This may be a good solution for targets which are impossible to probe
in the running state. Other targets shouldn't need it.
