Yes, unfortunately the Atmel Windows-based ISP works fine, but they don't
provide source code for that!  :)

I am reasonably sure that is correct.  As I stated earlier I can erase,
write, and verify the image with OpenOCD, but unfortunately the first stage
boostrapper &quot;RomBOOT&quot; doesn't like it.  I am starting to wonder if it is
balking because of what is stored in the OOB areas, but I can't get OpenOCD
to read back images burned by their ISP (yet).  I also tried writing the
same image with U-Boot to see if that made any difference and the first
stage bootstrapper doesn't like it either.
 
&gt;<i> Other than that, you can try debugging the bootloader that's trying to access
</I>&gt;<i> the NAND flash (using OpenOCD + gdb). Good luck with that.
</I>
And there lies one of the problems I am suffering.  The Atmel RomBOOT is
masked programmed by the factory and Atmel doesn't appear to provide source
code for that either.  That is an issue for sure.
