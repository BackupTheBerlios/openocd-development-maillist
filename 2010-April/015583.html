<PRE>I have a SEGV when trying to use nand check_bad_blocks on a DaVinci DM355 , OpenOCD version cc5f3c85de7632a32f41b435c54b83487a3aa622 and 4-bit infix ECC layout.

This is because nand_build_bbt() calls nand_read_page() with NULL, 0 for data pointer and size, the davinci nand code doesn't like that; gdb:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x0000000000451a1a in davinci_read_block_data (
    nand=&lt;value optimized out&gt;, data=0x0, data_size=512)
    at davinci.c:199
199                     data[0] = tmp;
(gdb) bt 4
#0  0x0000000000451a1a in davinci_read_block_data (
    nand=&lt;value optimized out&gt;, data=0x0, data_size=512)
    at davinci.c:199
#1  0x0000000000451e90 in davinci_read_page_ecc4infix (nand=0x75a2e0,
    page=&lt;value optimized out&gt;, data=0x0, data_size=0,
    oob=0x7fffffffd090 &quot;&quot;, oob_size=&lt;value optimized out&gt;)
    at davinci.c:615
#2  0x000000000041a68f in nand_build_bbt (nand=0x75a2e0,
    first=&lt;value optimized out&gt;, last=8191) at core.c:237
#3  0x000000000041003a in handle_nand_check_bad_blocks_command (
    cmd=0x7fffffffd140) at tcl.c:257

Looking at nand_read_page_raw() for inspiration though, I see that it does this:

        if (data)
                nand_read_data_page(nand, data, data_size);

        if (oob)
                nand_read_data_page(nand, oob, oob_size);

Maybe I'm missing something, but doesn't that mean when called from nand_build_bbt(), the data read will be skipped completely and oob will actually contain the first data from the page? Shouldn't it do a dummy read instead?

Seems like at the moment it will be mis-identifying bad blocks based on in-band rather than OOB data.

Mailed to list earlier for comments, but meanwhile I am going to continue code spelunking and maybe come up with patches. I need to understand davinci NAND stuff thoroughly and make sure it's all working with OpenOCD.
