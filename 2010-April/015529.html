<PRE>Hi Laurent, thanks for the reply.

EMU0 and EMU1 are routed to the JTAG header but no other pulls or jumpers on this board, so just the internal DM355 pullup - they will both be &quot;1&quot;.
The OpenOCD script seems to be enabling the other TAPs via the ICE though.. Not sure what you mean by ICE Pick Mode having issues booting from reset?

&gt;<i> note : you could still route the SRST (ARM RESET signal) from the
</I>&gt;<i> Amontec JTAGkey-Tiny to the ARM_RSTn signal on your DM355 board. (eg.
</I>&gt;<i> on pin 15 of the TI SAMTEC 20-pin header).
</I>
I might have to try that later. This is a custom board without the 20-pin header, I can get at RESET on a test point or something if I have to.

At the moment I am looking into triggering a watchdog reset with a reset-assert handler.. Be good if I can avoid soldering.

&gt;<i> If you want to use the RTCK (adaptive return clock ) signal, you could
</I>&gt;<i> update your ICE to an Amontec JTAGkey-2 dongle. This will help
</I>&gt;<i> accelerate your debug and help to have a stable debug.
</I>
If I can get this stuff working we may order a few :)
