Hi Dominik,

</I>&gt;<i> Hello Carsten,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I only know about Pierre (from this list) and someone from 
</I>&gt;<i> the openezx project. The people from openezx are working on 
</I>&gt;<i> their own linux on motorola XScale based phones, but the 
</I>&gt;<i> problem there is that they have no documentation for the 
</I>&gt;<i> board, i.e. they don't know for sure which reset lines go where etc.
</I>
That is basically my problem as well. I only have parts of the
schematic.

&gt;<i> One thing that came to my mind: What type of reset supervisor 
</I>&gt;<i> are you using on your board? If reset line is push-pull with 
</I>&gt;<i> no (large enough) resistor before the connection to JTAG 
</I>&gt;<i> nSRST, the JTAG pod wont be able to drive the signal low. 
</I>&gt;<i> Same goes for nTRST.
</I>
That issue seems to be ok. But I found that asserting SRST causes
nVCC_FAULT to drop to 0.1 V (low). According to the Intel Manuals the
JTAG TAP will reset whenever either of BATT_FAULT or VCC_FAULT is
asserted. 

I modified the xscale_(de)assert_reset() routines to proof things in
software. As soon as SRST is asserted, the JTAG is dead - only '0'
outputs on TDO. Meanwhile I got a good understanding of your code, so I
explicitly moved the expected TAP state after SRST deassertion to
TAP_TLR, and - surprise - the xscale_read_dcsr() routine reselects the
DCSR again after deassertion of SRST and read an all zero DCSR register.
Before SRST assertion I was able to set, clear and readback DCSR as many
times I wished.

Your code seems to expect the TAP being in TAP_RTI state at this point,
and therefore the code didn't reselect DCSR and immediatly reads from
the TAP. The only thing I get in this case, is the lower nibble of the
ID code (0x79265013) instead of 0x2 for the first bits.

So I'm pretty much sure, that the TAP is reseting while SRST is
asserted.

Pierre might try to measure the both *_FAULT signals on his board. If
either of them is dropping to low (asserted), the problem might be the
same as for me.

Regards
Carsten
