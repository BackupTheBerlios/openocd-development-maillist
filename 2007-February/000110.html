<PRE>Hello Carsten,

&gt;<i> &gt; One thing that came to my mind: What type of reset supervisor
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are you using on your board? If reset line is push-pull with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no (large enough) resistor before the connection to JTAG
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nSRST, the JTAG pod wont be able to drive the signal low.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Same goes for nTRST.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That issue seems to be ok. But I found that asserting SRST causes
</I>&gt;<i> nVCC_FAULT to drop to 0.1 V (low). According to the Intel Manuals the
</I>&gt;<i> JTAG TAP will reset whenever either of BATT_FAULT or VCC_FAULT is
</I>&gt;<i> asserted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I had a look at the PXA27x design guide, and it says that:
For JTAG TAP operation, the nBATT_FAULT and nVCC_FAULT pins must always be 
driven high (de-asserted). An active low signal on either pin puts the device 
into sleep mode, which powers down all JTAG circuitry.

That explains the problems you're seeing.

&gt;<i> I modified the xscale_(de)assert_reset() routines to proof things in
</I>&gt;<i> software. As soon as SRST is asserted, the JTAG is dead - only '0'
</I>&gt;<i> outputs on TDO. Meanwhile I got a good understanding of your code, so I
</I>&gt;<i> explicitly moved the expected TAP state after SRST deassertion to
</I>&gt;<i> TAP_TLR, and - surprise - the xscale_read_dcsr() routine reselects the
</I>&gt;<i> DCSR again after deassertion of SRST and read an all zero DCSR register.
</I>&gt;<i> Before SRST assertion I was able to set, clear and readback DCSR as many
</I>&gt;<i> times I wished.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your code seems to expect the TAP being in TAP_RTI state at this point,
</I>&gt;<i> and therefore the code didn't reselect DCSR and immediatly reads from
</I>&gt;<i> the TAP. The only thing I get in this case, is the lower nibble of the
</I>&gt;<i> ID code (0x79265013) instead of 0x2 for the first bits.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>When you explicitly told the JTAG subsystem that the TAP is in T-L-R you 
basically did the same as setting the reset_config to &quot;srst_pulls_trst&quot;. This 
option was added to work around the reset implementation found on LPC2000 
(ARM7TDMI). Unfortunately the problem is that the DCSR has to be programmed 
while nSRST is being held low, otherwise the core starts executing, and 
there's no use in catching it later.

&gt;<i> So I'm pretty much sure, that the TAP is reseting while SRST is
</I>&gt;<i> asserted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yeah. Your board seems to pull nVCC_FAULT low (it's an input to the PXA), 
causing the device to enter deep-sleep, which disables JTAG.

&gt;<i> Pierre might try to measure the both *_FAULT signals on his board. If
</I>&gt;<i> either of them is dropping to low (asserted), the problem might be the
</I>&gt;<i> same as for me.
</I>&gt;<i>

Dominic
