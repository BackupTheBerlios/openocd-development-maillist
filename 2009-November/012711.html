</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [Openocd-development] Openocd vrs Commercial jtag dongles
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Recently, I've been using quite a few commercial jtag tools from chip
</I>&gt;<i> vendors.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One thing I've noticed is that they all have implement the design with
</I>&gt;<i> an small usb-controller + FPGA of some type (typically a xilinx
</I>&gt;<i> spartan). I can see the real benefit, they download and flash the
</I>target
&gt;<i> at an unbelievable speed, ie: couple seconds for 256K of data. In
</I>&gt;<i> contrast, non-fpga solutions, (bitbang &amp; ftdi, etc) are much slower
</I>overall.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My guess is they are creating a hugely fast chip specific download
</I>&gt;<i> engine they just feed data bytes to - and it operates at some hugely
</I>&gt;<i> fast speed (that probably helps) In theory, the dongle has 2 modes,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;simple slow bitbang&quot; - once the target is determined, download an
</I>&gt;<i> acceleration engine the fpga.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The debugger step-in/over/line/etc rate with these tools is so fast...
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps they have have implemented some common tasks like step and
</I>&gt;<i> register dump type sequences in the dongle's fpga.  Watch windows are
</I>&gt;<i> for example very snappy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sadly, that also requires a lot of engineering expertise to write that
</I>&gt;<i> fpga code. in the cases I've seen [ie: vendor supplied tools] the chip
</I>&gt;<i> companies also have a large pool of people who know or understand
</I>&gt;<i> verilog/vhdl and can write such fpga code.
</I>
The FPGA isn't that difficult. I've created a similar setup using
OpenOCD. The biggest problem I had was that OpenOCD is spending most of
its time creating JTAG bit streams. Its not the bit-banging that takes
most of the time! On a 333MHz platform it took about 15 minutes to
program 180kB into flash (with an FPGA for the JTAG interface!).

To get more speed I created pre-defined JTAG commands for memory write
and memory read and fill in the blanks (address and data) when necessary
(very target specific ofcourse!). This reduced the programming time to a
few seconds. I guess the effect will be less on a PC, but I think it
might be worth to do some profiling. This could be made into a generic
solution if OpenOCD would support a caching mechanism that allows
patching existing JTAG bit streams.
