In that case I'll commit the rest of this set, now that it
passes my basic testing.  The flash erase check behaves, so
do register modifications and &quot;arm reg&quot;, single step behaves.

Overall it's now looking and acting a lot more like any other
ARM core.  (And there's soon to be a place to hang that 
context-sensitive breakpoint stuff too...)

Plus this shrinks the size of &quot;arm11.c&quot; by 20%, measured by
line count ... that type of update I like a WHOLE lot!  :)

I haven't touched that level of code, though I think that the
ARM11 code is doing some stuff it doesn't need to do.  This is
just putting the existing lowlevel JTAG ops into the same kind
of framework other ARMs use.

However, I *have* been testing with those new &quot;even shorter&quot;
JTAG paths I sent by a while ago ... which include the more
visible initialization, building the bit vectors from lists
of states instead of just being cryptic.

I heard about an FT2232 issue we may want to pay attention to:

  <A HREF="http://developer.intra2net.com/mailarchive/html/libftdi/2009/msg00292.html">http://developer.intra2net.com/mailarchive/html/libftdi/2009/msg00292.html</A>

That would affect such low-level things.  But for now I'm
content to not worry about such issues.  :)
