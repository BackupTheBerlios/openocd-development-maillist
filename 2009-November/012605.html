<PRE>&gt;<i> Just to clarify the whole issue once more, my proposal was actually
</I>&gt;<i> three different things:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Making the use of scan_field safer by providing standard handlers
</I>&gt;<i> for the most common cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This not only helps with the readability and reduces trivial
</I>&gt;<i> copy&amp;paste errors. It also makes it much simpler to rewire the
</I>&gt;<i> underlying scan_field in a later step.
</I>
We can relatively easily do away with the scanfields entirely
rather than putting lipstick on it... See the branch I was working on
or jtag_add_dr_out() API for which I'm looking into adding a in_value
as well as the existing &quot;out_value&quot; that it takes today.

&gt;<i> 2. Eliminating the global variable jtag_command_queue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The existing jtag_add_... commands would remain similar but would
</I>&gt;<i> operate on a local copy of the queue. jtag_execute_queue then receives
</I>&gt;<i> the pointer to that local copy as parameter instead of using
</I>&gt;<i> jtag_command_queue. The last user then disposes of the command queue.
</I>
This assumes that there is a queue at all. It should be up to the interface
to implement a queue if that is what is needed.

The current JTAG calls should be invoked on the interface rather
than assuming a single global instance. This is covered by todo.txt
section today as an architectural improvement.

&gt;<i> 3. Break up jtag_add_dr_scan etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This works best in tandem with (2). The general idea is not to pass
</I>&gt;<i> one array of scan fields but to pass them in separate function calls
</I>&gt;<i> (which would mimic, but replace the ones in (1)). To output a 7 bit
</I>&gt;<i> field the caller just hands the value to the function and doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> bother about allocating space. To turn jtag_add_?r_scan inside out
</I>&gt;<i> like this requires its states to be kept somewhere so that
</I>&gt;<i> plausibility checks and bypassing can be done. The local copy of the
</I>&gt;<i> jtag_command_queue would be ideal for that (although it would also
</I>&gt;<i> work by adding even more global variables). The caller then does
</I>&gt;<i> something like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> jtag_queue_t * q = jq_alloc_queue();
</I>
I'm very much against *forcing* interfaces to implement a queue
in memory. It should be possible to execute the commands
synchronously. The existance of a queue would make the code
*much* less efficient on embedded devices.


Did you look at jtag_add_dr_out() which exists today?
