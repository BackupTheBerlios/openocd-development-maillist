For the record, I think it becomes important to distinguish between
&quot;light&quot; and &quot;heavy&quot; embedded.  Right now, we can support the later by
way of embedded ARM (uC)Linux or eCos.  The former requires addressing
the points you list below.  Each requires its own type of documentation.
For now, $SUBJECT relates to the heavier platforms.

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  - Allowing different ways to provide image data,
</I>&gt;<i>    like through USB endpoints or TCP sockets
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's for starters.  I suppose another thing to address

</I>
Yup.  There is a lot of work to do to provide these things in the
general case, and these are worthy goals to consider.  Today, we have
the ZY1000's eCos-related support, but we should be considering other
use cases with even less resources.  Personally, I think strategic
documentation will be pivotal to executing such a project, as the issues
merit full enumeration and prioritizing... outside of the style guide or
this thread.

For now, feel free to add a section to the TODO list with your points,
as I do not recall the above existing there with such specificity.

Cheers,

Zach
