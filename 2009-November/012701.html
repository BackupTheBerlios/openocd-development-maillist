Yes, I know that code. I've got a committed patch of mine in there.

&gt;<i> Are you *sure* the error message isn't in fact telling you that this is a quaint
</I>&gt;<i> requirement of stm32?
</I>
It most certainly an STM32 specific quirk. This is sort of what I was trying to say in the first place. Let met explain further:

* The &quot;flash write_image&quot; function is trying to be smart by only deleting, (un)protecting and flashing those sectors that have to be modified. This is a good thing.

* The STM32 specific flash code has certain alignment requirements, which currently only generate an error in case of a non-compliant situation. This is not very bad, but it can be done better.

* My suggestion is to add a global parameter which tells OpenOCD to handle alignment issues in a smart way (globally); by adjusting the sector counts automatically in such that these errors do not appear. I suggest that we do not make this the default setting, because the &quot;flash write_image&quot; and &quot;flash write_sectors&quot; use the same code to write to the flash. If the default settings are such that OpenOCD automatically adjusts sector counts, then the user might get unexpected results when using &quot;flash write_sectors&quot;. So to be safe, OpenOCD must not adjust sector counts, but only when told to do so.

* For now, the smart_sector_aligment setting will only be regarded by the STM32-specific code. Any other platforms that are eligible for alligment smartness? A quick grep through the code gives:

./src/flash/lpc288x.c:320:              return ERROR_FLASH_DST_BREAKS_ALIGNMENT;
./src/flash/lpc2000.c:568:              return ERROR_FLASH_DST_BREAKS_ALIGNMENT;
./src/flash/stellaris.c:946:            return ERROR_FLASH_DST_BREAKS_ALIGNMENT;
./src/flash/stm32x.c:572:               return ERROR_FLASH_DST_BREAKS_ALIGNMENT;
./src/flash/str9xpec.c:589:             return ERROR_FLASH_DST_BREAKS_ALIGNMENT;
./src/flash/pic32mx.c:482:              return ERROR_FLASH_DST_BREAKS_ALIGNMENT;
./src/flash/at91sam7.c:975:             return ERROR_FLASH_DST_BREAKS_ALIGNMENT;
./src/flash/avrf.c:229:                 return ERROR_FLASH_DST_BREAKS_ALIGNMENT;
./src/flash/str9x.c:481:                return ERROR_FLASH_DST_BREAKS_ALIGNMENT;
./src/flash/str7x.c:449:                return ERROR_FLASH_DST_BREAKS_ALIGNMENT;

So, I'll try and figure out where smart_aligment might be useful. As these are quite a diverse bunch of controllers, I'm not sure I dare touch all of the code. I'll have to see if it's worth the trouble, if at all do-able.

&gt;<i> There is a bug in stm32 code in that it gives you a warning and not
</I>&gt;<i> an error, but that's minor.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	if ((first &amp;&amp; (first % stm32x_info-&gt;ppage_size)) || ((last + 1) &amp;&amp;
</I>&gt;<i> (last + 1) % stm32x_info-&gt;ppage_size))
</I>&gt;<i> 	{
</I>&gt;<i> 		LOG_WARNING(&quot;Error: start and end sectors must be on a %d sector
</I>&gt;<i> boundary&quot;, stm32x_info-&gt;ppage_size);
</I>&gt;<i> 		return ERROR_FLASH_SECTOR_INVALID;
</I>&gt;<i> 	}
</I>
Correct. And I will remove this little &quot;beauty mark&quot; along with adding the alignment parameter then :-)
