And I'll repeat that *address space access* really ought to
get split out from *target*.

There are debug architectures -- Nexus, and ARM's ADIv5 come
quickly to mind -- which can expose address space access without
necessarily having a debuggable CPU/target involved.

So it's eminently practical to have access to flash without
having a target, in those cases.

</I>
Which is why we need to be using Tcl more intelligently.  I like
the idea of commands getting rid of the notion of &quot;current target&quot;
from all command implementations and documentation ... replacing it
instead with &quot;the target whose interpreter is in front of the rest
of the command engines&quot;.


&gt;<i> I view the flash write_image as high level utility command, not something that
</I>&gt;<i> the target offers.
</I>
It's coupled to an address space.  If that were a first level concept,
a lot of the other stuff would fall out cleanly.

(Yes, older cores do couple target and address space, since it's the
CPU/target which is doing the memory access instead of a debug port.)
