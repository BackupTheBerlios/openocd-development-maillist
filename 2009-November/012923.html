Today's interface is built around the concept of a queue.

The thing which permits synchronous execution is having
that queue be implicit, with a handful of explicit flush
points called jtag_execute_queue().

It might be worth exploring which way to go.  Nothing is
currently reusing the queues -- it's not possible since
they are hidden!! -- but as others have pointed out, it'd
be a win to be able to do that instead of constantly needing
to reallocat and reinitialize the same command queues.


&gt;<i> The current JTAG calls should be invoked on the interface rather

</I>&gt;<i> section today as an architectural improvement.
</I>
That's a separable issue.  I personally don't have an issue
with expecting one OpenOCD process to manage only a single
scan chain, through a single JTAG adapter/interface.  It's
certainly the common case ... and it seems to me like useful
simplification, rather than oversimplification.
