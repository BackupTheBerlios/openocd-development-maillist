Has the LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress solution really been discussed?!


This would mean that actually 0 bytes of proprietary code need to be 
shipped with OpenOCD, because the static import-.lib isn't needed at all 
to compile or run it.

So it's not a violation of Clause 3 of the GPLv2 anymore (that was the 
offending clause, IIRC?):

   &quot;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.&quot;


Where's the problem, when the propietary import.-lib isn't compiled-in 
and shipped with OpenOCD any more?


The FAQ even has an entry for this:

   <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.html#FSWithNFLibs">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.html#FSWithNFLibs</A>

which says, it's not nice, but ok. Even the &quot;If it depends on a non-free 
library to run at all, it cannot be part of a free operating system such 
as GNU&quot;  wouldn't count anymore with LoadLibrary, because OpenOCD could 
run fine without the import-lib doing it's automatic thing on startup.
