Depends what &quot;important&quot; means.  :)

There are decisions which need thought ... and a lot more
that just need to not happen during the RC phase of the
release cycle.

So you mean slow down for *all* changes then?  Instead
of just the &quot;important&quot; ones?

Rushing things into the tree is admittedly not good.

For one example, I just did a &quot;git bisect&quot; to track
down what broke &quot;load_image&quot; for me.  It turned out
to be commit b5ce7fe8125da3044a2b4f2d0ef57af4d9eef5e7
A.K.A. &quot;target: require working area for physical/virtual
addresses to be specified&quot;.  (The MMU enabled/disabled
branches are switched, so when the MMU is inactive it
tries writing to virtual addresses...)

That one forces a first-ever bugfix release; sigh.

On the other hand, a lot of the problem with that patch
came from arriving during the RC phase, when everything
is supposed to get extra scrutiny.  If that had been
checked in yesterday, fixing it wouldn't be any kind
of headache at all.  It would still have been a bad
patch that got rushed into the tree ... but it would
only have been routine merge window disruption, not
a brown-paper-bag type problem.

 
&gt;<i> In the last couple of days we've seen how successful branched
</I>&gt;<i> development have been with git already(Yes. I saw the light
</I>&gt;<i> eventually...) There is now much  less of a disadvantage of
</I>&gt;<i> maintaining new features off the master branch.
</I>
Worth pointing out that the branching isn't dependant on
using git ... my part was done with quilt, for example,
until the actual merge.

Key point is the commitment by developers to have private
patch queues, and to prioritize pushing stuff upstream.
(And then to cope with the inevitable conflict resolutions
that come from concurrent development.)

Example, I've got an xscale patch I've been holding off
for well over a month, while the 0.3.0 wrapped up... since
it has the potential to cause problems.


&gt;<i> I'm hopeful we 
</I>&gt;<i> can train the community to *test* these non-master branches
</I>&gt;<i> as well eventually...
</I>
If the topic branches have significant-enough updates,
that will happen over time.  Carrot, not stick.
