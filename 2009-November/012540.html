Atmel would compare it to NOR based on the reliability concerns.
AFAICT that's true of all SPI flashes.  Another NOR-ish factor is
that those chips are relatively small ... no GByte SPI flash.

The NAND-ishness is just that the page size isn't always binary,
and the sizes are more like small page (or VERY small page) NAND.
Newer ones let you (permanently) disable those extra bytes.

Something unique to DataFlash compared to other SPI flashes is
that most &quot;real&quot; dataflash includes two single-page SRAM buffers.
So you can write to one SRAM buffer while the other gets written
to flash, then ping-pong.

I think splitting NOR and NAND out better is appropriate.

As for SPI ... there'd be two ways to achieve that.  One
would be just using the JTAG adapter as a SPI adapter.
The other is more like I suspect you're doing for the SAM9:
use JTAG to talk with an on-chip SPI controller.  In either
case it'd make sense to have a bit of an abstraction layer
around SPI.
