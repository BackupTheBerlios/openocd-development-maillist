Not for me!  After &quot;reset halt&quot; it's in ARM mode; reliable.
Likewise &quot;halt&quot; after it's been running U-Boot a while.

Maybe you have firmware which really *is* running in Thumb
mode?  No reason the boot code shouldn't use it.  What JTAG
adapter did you usse, and are your results OK otherwise?
Does &quot;dap info 1&quot; show a sane ROM table, etc?

Why does this email say it is &quot;always&quot; in that state, but in
the URL below (two days ago) says only &quot;occasionally&quot;?


&gt;<i>     Actually, I sent a patch which could fix this.

Note that you're changing two things:

 - JTAG clocking, so that there will be cases where
   commands get delivered too fast for the chip to
   process (unless adaptive clocking kicks in).

 - The &quot;no SRST&quot; workaround moves very early, so in
   your case the core is running for a *LONG* time
   before the halt can take effect.  (Instead of a
   fairly short period.)

I'd suspect the latter is more related to your symptom.

Are you 100% certain that the core really *isn't* running
in Thumb mode early in your boot sequence?

And there's still some strangeness to be sorted out, with
respect to why the the TAP ID doesn't get reported when
OpenOCD first starts.


&gt;<i>     Any comments on this patch?
</I>
Overall, the reset logic still needs work.  And Cortex-A8
needs a *LOT* of work.  But this patch isn't forward motion,
at least for me.

For Cortex-A8 there's still a basic issue that it doesn't
know how to use the vector catch hardware,  so &quot;reset halt&quot;
never halts right after reset.  Until that's in place it'll
be hard to track down some of the reset issues.

That &quot;cortex_a8 dbginit&quot; thing is messy too.  The fact that
it's needed seems to me to signify a bug...

And for Beagle, there's also the issue that there's still
only a poor workaround for the &quot;no SRST&quot; case.  It's going
to involve some callout to TCL code ... but it'll have to
be smarter, so that it can kick in the vector catch.
