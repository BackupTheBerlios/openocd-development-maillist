The use of angle brackets intends to distinguish parameter names from
literal arguments.  Thus [&lt;foo&gt;]  means an optional thing which
semantically will be used as a &quot;foo&quot;, whereas [foo|bar] means you can
optionally provide the 'foo' or 'bar' options (literally).  If the
parameter is required, I used (foo|bar) or &lt;foo|bar&gt; depending on
whether the parameter should be literal or figurative, respectively.

By the end of my work, I intended for the usage follow these rules, but
it was a long process and I did not have them formulated this clearly.
The use of angle brackets may be non-standard for BNF, but it was based
on the practices for usage information in most command line utilities.

I had been considering parsing these strings and using them to automate
argument parsing.  Imagine a function (a la sscanf) that takes the usage
string as the format specifier, a command_invocation, and the parameter
variables to be filled as outputs.  This requires a standard syntax
throughout, and something that looks like BNF is a good choice for sure.
That would make the series far more challenging, to be sure. :)

For now, I think it would be helpful for us to add a section to the new
command API documentation to record the desired rules.  That should give
the standard for writing and registering command handlers in OpenOCD.

Would you mind taking a stab at this documentation task?  It might also
give you a chance to touch up that API information (or remark about
possible omissions).  As the author of both the code and the docs, it's
likely that I have missed something therein that you will spot when
making new changes.

Cheers,

Zach
