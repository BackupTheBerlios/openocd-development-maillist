That's not your problem.

On STM32 when the core is halted (whatever was the reason) some 
peripherals (including timers) continue to operate normally. This is a 
good thing - imagine writing a software for SMSP and no possibility to 
halt the chip - you'd have 50% chance of frying the coil and the switch 
when the PWM would stop working. That's why when you stop your program 
some peripherals keep working and keep sending interrupt signals, making 
single stepping virtually impossible.

To &quot;solve this&quot; you can really stop the timer and some other peripherals 
when the core is stopped (if your hardware allows to do that) - take a 
look at the DBGMCU-&gt;CR register.

4\/3!!
