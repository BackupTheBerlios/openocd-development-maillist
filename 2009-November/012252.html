Yes ... please discuss this with Simon, who's got some of this
going on his hardware (FT2232-based) and has posted a few patches
to this list.  (He calls it SWJ, but I believe we should refer to
it as SWD to match more common usage.)

UART ... why?  To get that single wire trace mode working?

Yes, I think we'll want that.  But I don't think we have any
of the necessary infrastructure in place yet...

&quot;git status&quot; will tell you some things.  It's not clear from that
message alone what your problem is.  (At least, not to me...)

As a rule, if your workspace is &quot;clean&quot; (everything committed) I
think you shouldn't see such messages.

 
&gt;<i> and it tells me it can't merge. I suspect that I will run into further
</I>&gt;<i> problems as my working copy continues to drift away from the master so I
</I>&gt;<i> would like to resolve this soon. I know the problem lies with me not
</I>&gt;<i> understanding git, so help is appreciated. The tutorial didn't help me
</I>&gt;<i> resolve the above.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The patch that I will eventually post will be quite big, is this going
</I>&gt;<i> to be a problem for the person who merges the patch into the master?
</I>
Yes.  You need to plan on a series of small *reviewable* patches.

As an example ... maybe

 - add SWD support to interface level
 - add interface subcommands so &quot;SWD-only&quot; boards can be described
 - similarly, &quot;no-SWD&quot; (probably a target-level default)
 - implement it for FT2232
 - implement it for R-Link
 - add commands for switching between SWD and JTAG
 - SWD for scanchain detection/validation/autoprobing
 - Cortex-M3 using SWD
 - ... surely more ...

Tools like &quot;quilt&quot; and &quot;stg&quot; may be useful for your particular
workflow.  Regardless, the result *MUST NOT BE* One Huge Patch.

Again, if you and Simon work on this together, the result will
be more viable.  Be sure to propose interface changes while they
can still be changed easily.
