My issue with that patch is that it should not be needed!

If there is no mmu() method ... that's sufficient to
know that has_mmu() == false.  Etc.


&gt;<i> Some generic MMU/cache methods: virtual to physical translation,
</I>&gt;<i> mmu enabled, flush cache line, flush data cache, generic
</I>&gt;<i> embedded trace buffer fn's, more specifically mrc/mcr, etc.
</I>
You're mixing in *ALL KINDS* of stuff that's not MMU-related.
Cache isn't.  ETB isn't.  Coprocessor access isn't.

 
&gt;<i> What does virt2phys translation mean when no MMU
</I>&gt;<i> is present or MMU is disabled?
</I>
Simplest answer:  it's an identity mapping.  If there
is *ever* a question, treat a no-MMU target as if it's
an MMU-enabled target with a permanently installed
memory mapping equating virtual and physical addresses.

 
&gt;<i> Are addresses for a machine that has no MMU virtual/logic
</I>&gt;<i> or physical? I'd say the answer is pick one to this particular
</I>&gt;<i> question. My interpretation is that only an MMU can have
</I>&gt;<i> logical/virtual addresses and that a non-MMU CPU has
</I>&gt;<i> only physical addresses. This interpretation broke OpenOCD...
</I>
That's part of why I suggested that simpler answer.

Really ... unless there's an active MMU, why even
bother asking that question?  The &quot;break&quot; came from
trying to draw a needless distinction.


&gt;<i> Should read/write to physical memory fail or succeed when
</I>&gt;<i> the CPU has no MMU? I'd say fail.
</I>
Where I'd say &quot;succeed&quot; ... there is *ONLY* physical memory
in such cases.  (Note, that answer is consistent with the
interpretation you gave above ... unlike a &quot;fail&quot; answer.)

Any special casing should be for virtual addressing, and
should boil down to that implicit identity mapping.


&gt;<i> Say we provide default implementations that do &quot;safe
</I>&gt;<i> no-op&quot; for all fn's instead of failing.
</I>
What would a NOP be though?  How could it ever be &quot;safe&quot;
if it tried to hide real errors, which must be handled?

Treating virtual and physical addresses as being the
same (for no-MMU targets) wouldn't be a NOP.

 
&gt;<i> If you now invoke some higher level functionality that
</I>&gt;<i> builds on these &quot;safe no-op&quot;'s you end up with a
</I>&gt;<i> compound behavior that we can't really account for.
</I>&gt;<i> I fear ending up in a situation where nobody dares
</I>&gt;<i> touch the  default &quot;successful no-op&quot; fn's because nobody
</I>&gt;<i> knows what relies on their &quot;no-op&quot;...
</I>
I don't follow.  Disregarding all non-MMU stuff,
and presuming the above commit gets reverted, what
are the &quot;no-ops&quot; you refer to?


&gt;<i> Sorry for breaking the release(again) though.
</I>
Are you saying there's some other bug related to the
MMU stuff, which made it into the v0.3.1 branch?

You might have lost some context.  The above patch,
which caused $SUBJECT bug, is newer than that.

I suspect the MMU stuff does need more thinking,
but I can't see any way for it to cause trouble
for no-MMU targets (like $SUBJECT) unless some
kind of inappropriate distinction gets made.  But
unfortunately that patch (which I want to revert)
does make such a distinction.
