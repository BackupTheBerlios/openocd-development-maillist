<PRE>With 0.3.x nearly done, this seems a good time to put a
stake in the ground for the 0.4.x cycle:  rough schedule,
and a handful of goals.

As a rough schedule ... ship in January 2010, close the
merge window before the December solstice, have a few
weeks of RC milestones (bugfix-oriented) before shipping.

Even *having* goals for a release will be a change!

 - To work within that rough schedule ... previous
   releases had no such thing.
 
 - Getting rid of some of the obsolete commands, and
   their documentation in the User's Guide.  Ones with
   January 2010 expiration dates on them should go.

 - Merging ongoing development and bugfixes, subject to
   the schedule (above).  For stuff that doesn't make
   this release, developers can track mainline (example,
   with git branches) to help hit the next release.

To developers:  if you have significant changes you want
this release to include, please describe them in followups
on this thread.  That includes stuff that could merge now
if the merge window were open, as well as stuff that you
expect will be finished before the window closes.
 
The basic model is merging potentially-destabilizing stuff
during the merge window -- earlier is better! -- using the
RC phases to fix any ensuing problems and resolve omissions.
Also: to get everyone used to such cycles, with quality
releases coming out semi-regularly.

Comments?

- Dave
