I think you misunderstood what I am proposing. I did not suggest to
execute the sequence immediately. I am not only aware of the USB
latency, in fact the arm11 code relies on it for the burst mode.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The USB drivers have a 1ms roundtrip problem to contend with, the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> rest is in the noise, essentially. There is plenty of evidence to this effect.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did. We need both streamlined and fast code. Until we have both sorted,
</I>&gt;<i> we leave things the way they are.
</I>
My proposal does not imply any decrease in speed, it can lead to an
increase. It still builds up a jtag sequence before executing it, it
just modifies the interface for value types.

&gt;&gt;<i> Your example seemed to be too much of a workaround rather than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> addressing the problem directly, which IMO is that the uint32_t case
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is so common that there should be a short unambiguous way to deal with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Of course even a set of standard wrappers to package the set-up of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> most common field configurations would help a lot, without also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> serving as a shortcut into the minidriver-layer to avoid the copying.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've got some thoughts on how to do this, but nothing written up yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Also we have to *carefully* consider how we can make *small* steps that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> can be tested on all the hardware combinations. Otherwise any change
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is unlikely to pay off. We're getting there but it will and should take time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It was a suggestion on long-term goals. Small steps are usually most
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> effective when they go towards a specific target.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm doing small steps in a branch for now. We'll see how it pans out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That branch might end up being a big leap before it is pushed to
</I>&gt;<i> the master branch.
