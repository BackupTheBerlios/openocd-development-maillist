Read the following article, through the &quot;feature development&quot; section:

<A HREF="http://reinh.com/blog/2009/03/02/a-git-workflow-for-agile-teams.html">http://reinh.com/blog/2009/03/02/a-git-workflow-for-agile-teams.html</A>

Also, see the man page for git rebase, as it has a tutorial for
splitting patches and other tasks.  I am still trying to find the best
work flow, but that is the fundamental process which leads to a simple
linear history in the master repository.

It takes discipline regarding building patch series.  Git makes the
process easier than past alternatives, but you have to adopt the overall
methodology of committing lots of patches that contain exactly one
atomic (or even sub-atomic) change per commit (and figuring out the best
logical order to apply them, which can mean reshuffling and resolving
conflicts from rebasing against yourself).  Commit early, commit often.
Every patch should leave the tree in a state that compiles cleanly.

Sorry for the conflicts though.  It'll be worth it in the long run, and
you should end up causing more rebase conflicts for yourself while
developing your patches than anyone else does by pushing upstream. ;)
