That was my first thought. But then I thought that that would affect all drivers, so I liked the thought of a quick and simple solution like a 'just_shutup_and_work' flag.

But I'm afraid that your proposal might be the way to go. I need to take a better look at the rest of the code to get a better picture first. I'll try and have a look this week and see what will be the most future-proof sollution. (Crap. Me and my big mouth :-)

Cheers,
