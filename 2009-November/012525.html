<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> Actually, the minidrivers don't clone today, so that's already taken care of.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Doesn't that apply only to zy1000.c ?
</I>
The USB case needs to delay execution to build a long
scan, so there copy is required.

&gt;&gt;<i> The USB drivers have a 1ms roundtrip problem to contend with, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rest is in the noise, essentially. There is plenty of evidence to this effect.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *You* brought up performance as concern... My goal was primarily
</I>&gt;<i> streamlining code.
</I>
I did. We need both streamlined and fast code. Until we have both sorted,
we leave things the way they are.

&gt;<i> Your example seemed to be too much of a workaround rather than
</I>&gt;<i> addressing the problem directly, which IMO is that the uint32_t case
</I>&gt;<i> is so common that there should be a short unambiguous way to deal with
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course even a set of standard wrappers to package the set-up of the
</I>&gt;<i> most common field configurations would help a lot, without also
</I>&gt;<i> serving as a shortcut into the minidriver-layer to avoid the copying.
</I>
I've got some thoughts on how to do this, but nothing written up yet.

&gt;&gt;<i> Also we have to *carefully* consider how we can make *small* steps that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can be tested on all the hardware combinations. Otherwise any change
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is unlikely to pay off. We're getting there but it will and should take time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It was a suggestion on long-term goals. Small steps are usually most
</I>&gt;<i> effective when they go towards a specific target.
</I>
I'm doing small steps in a branch for now. We'll see how it pans out.

That branch might end up being a big leap before it is pushed to
the master branch.
