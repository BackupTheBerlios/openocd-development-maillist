<PRE>&gt;<i> I disagree. &#160;You can't use flash without a target. &#160;We should never
</I>&gt;<i> offer that command without a target for it to be used with. &#160;The user
</I>&gt;<i> should not need to pull the two together on their own.
</I>
Sure you can!  I even believe that there is some support
for this in OpenOCD. The flash chip would then be directly
connected to the JTAG chain.

I don't understand the win for end-users to be required to specify,
target or flash chip when there is only one in the system.

On a technical level I see the problem of having e.g. cortex commands
passed to a mips target.

&gt;<i> You just said it: they operate on a target. &#160;Thus, it seems logical to
</I>&gt;<i> say that they are target commands; conversely, they should not be part
</I>&gt;<i> of the 'flash' command. &#160;They seem improperly categorized at present.
</I>
I think it is important to distinguish between user interface commands
and implementation commands.

I view the flash write_image as high level utility command, not something that
the target offers.


&gt;&gt;<i> I don't think that it is an improvement to the user experience to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> require a prefix to the flash command(current target or sole
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> flash in system), even if the tcl programming model is crisper.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ummm.. it's not requiring anything more than it already does. &#160;All of
</I>&gt;<i> the flash commands (except those you note above) require the flash bank
</I>&gt;<i> or its name as the first parameter. &#160;These changes would _replace_ the
</I>&gt;<i> 'flash' verb with the bank name. &#160;As such, this step will remove the
</I>&gt;<i> bank parameter, in the same way a target's commands do not require one.
</I>
I'm positive this would be viewed as a regression in user experience.

You have to know/keep in mind the name of the target. Especially
when switching  between targets this can be annoying.

I don't think that the current &quot;flash erase_address&quot; syntax is something
'bad' that we should support for backwards compatibility. I believe it is an
effective user interface to the underlying functionality. It's flawed in
several ways from a technical point of view, but that doesn't
make it less useful or effective.
