Yeah, sorry. ;)  I particularly apologize for 'git send-email' failing
to properly thread the messages for each series under their summaries.
Even so, only the first and last of the 6 series take any real thought,
and most patches are less than 10KB and can be reviewed trivially.

Personally, I want to see long series posted for a final review, even if
they get pulled from a mirror for testing.  If someone finds a problem
either from reading or testing, these messages provide the point of
departure for articulating the faults in a specific patch.

&gt;<i>  Dang :).  Anyway, what's an efficient way for me to try and port my
</I>&gt;<i> AT91SAM9 NAND flash over to this new interface?  I'm thinking I create
</I>&gt;<i> a branch for your changes, pull your changes against current

</I>&gt;<i> driver and the core updates that it depends on.  I'm not sure on what
</I>&gt;<i> the commands should be, so any direction would be appreciated. :)
</I>
First, you should not worry about it until it actually gets pushed, then
it will be a matter of rebasing and seeing what you need to do.  For the
most part, you should be able to study the patches in these series for
ideas about how to convert things... that's what they do.  

That said, you remind me that I forgot to update the command API
documentation, so that is another patch to add before I push this.
Then, you'll be able to look in the Doxygen manual:
doc/manual/helper.txt and doc/manual/primer/commands.txt.  These
reference the src/hello.c module, which this series uses as sub-commands
of the dummy/faux/testee drivers.

Defining your command set is another business entirely, but it should be
easier to implement them once you decide on it. :)
