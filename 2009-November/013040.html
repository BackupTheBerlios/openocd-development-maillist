<PRE>&gt;<i> Finally, would it be logical to create the dynamic flash banks commands
</I>&gt;<i> as subcommands of their relevant target?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;foo.cpu flash bank bank0 ..... &#160;# but no &lt;target&gt; arg anymore
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;foo.cpu bank0 info &#160;# presently, it's 'flash info bank0'
</I>
First of all: although I'm not able to follow all the changes to the command
stuff you are working on, I generally like the result and I'm happy to let
you run with it.

However, significant changes to the syntax is another matter. Here
I need to pay proper attention :-)

I think it is important to distinguish between telnet and scripting as a
user interface and tcl as a programming model.

In &gt;90-98% of all cases there is only a single flash configured.

In this case the current form in telnet &amp; scripting with just
using a &quot;flash&quot; command without referring to a particular
flash chip makes sense.

However, we here &quot;flash erase_address&quot; and &quot;flash write_image&quot; are
interesting. These flash commands do not operate on any flash
chips or banks, but rather figure out which flash chips in the current
target that a command goes to.

I don't think that it is an improvement to the user experience to
require a prefix to the flash command(current target or sole
flash in system), even if the tcl programming model is crisper.

I have seen that some users feel very strongly about erasing
particular banks and sectors and writing to these sectors, rather
than using addresses. I have never fully understand why they
feel so strongly about going the way of banks instead of addresses,
but the fact of the matter is that they do.

I also think it is a goal that OpenOCD should ship with high
quality board configuration scripts, where a user would not
really have any exposure to what a flash or cpu would be
named. The user would here happily use the higher level
fn's.

Perhaps a solution would be to implement high level tcl proc's
that present a user friendly way to manipulate flash and
to have the c level tcl interface be more clean and address
the technical concerns you raised?

I.e. rewrite &quot;flash erase_address&quot; and &quot;flash write_image&quot; as
tcl proc's?
