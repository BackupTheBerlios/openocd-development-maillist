I guess I don't understand why TMS should ever *implicitly* be
changed, or clocks *implicitly* be added.  This won't be the
only problem that causes ...


&gt;<i> I'm working on a solution, but have several options.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> a) Add yet more special case &quot;if (bits == 488)&quot; code in the adapter 
</I>&gt;<i> firmware main loop. This is horrible, but a quick fix. Would still go 
</I>&gt;<i> wrong if exactly 488 bits were required.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> b) Drop the extra clock from the adapter firmware, and add it in to the 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD driver code. Good solution, but requires coordination of releases 
</I>&gt;<i> of both the adapter firmware and OpenOCD.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> c) Drop the existing limited adapter firmware in favour of a more capable 
</I>&gt;<i> protocol, not limited to 64 byte transfers, and understanding complete &quot;do 
</I>&gt;<i> this entire scan&quot; or &quot;do this entire TMS sequence&quot; commands. Even better, 
</I>&gt;<i> but quite some considerable work.
</I>
Or just trim some of the side effects.  That would necessarily
call for changes in client firmware -- you could minimally just
update the device's bcdVersion code!  But the tweaks shouldn't
need to be huge.  &quot;Send this data&quot; would ignore TMS and just
clock data in/out.  &quot;Walk this TMS path&quot; would hold TDI fixed
and just clock TMS... individual packets could still be 64 byts
if you like.

Given the bug is a side effect of the protocol, I don't see a
way around some level of &quot;flag day&quot;.  There are ways to cut
the main involved in such stuff though.


Or if you want a &quot;no flagdays approach&quot;, then maybe OpenOCD
could be taught that it's got to transition from SHIFT to
PAUSE every adapter-specific-N bits.  That'd let you break
scans up into smaller chunks ... that's more or less just
why the PAUSE state exists.


&gt;<i> Probably none of this (even a) will get done for 0.3.0, but if anyone has 
</I>&gt;<i> any thoughts, I'd be interested.
</I>
There are also two other usbprog issues noted in the TODO list...
at least one of which seems kind of related (the &quot;long&quot; sequences).
