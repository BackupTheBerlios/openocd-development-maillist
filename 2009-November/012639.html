The example on my harddrive that has been put to pasture makes
use of it :-)

&gt;<i> And by adding out_value the caller is forced to hold all data in

</I>&gt;<i> first class citizens, not just choosing one that is the most commonly

</I>
The thing that &quot;forces&quot; the users to use 32 bit is the fact that the
*target* is 32 bit. It doesn't matter what word size the OpenOCD host
CPU is using in the approach I'm suggesting. It works equally well
with any *target* word size.


&gt;<i> These are two things. The global JTAG device instance and the global
</I>&gt;<i> command sequence. The TODO is specific on the device instances, but
</I>&gt;<i> not on command queues.
</I>
The whole point is that whether or not that there *is* an actual
command sequence is something that it is up to the interface
to implement. Today the interface has that freedom. By exposing
the queue explicitly in the calling API you remove the ability to
the interface to drop the implementation of a queue.

The current JTAG API allows for a hardware queue, which is super
efficient.

&gt;<i> Where is the bottleneck in this case? Latency, memory consumption, cpu
</I>&gt;<i> load or something else?
</I>
The *current* jtag_add_dr_out() implementation breaks down to *two pokes*
if you have a hardware JTAG queue.

*Anything* you add on top of that is going to increase performance overhead
siginficantly :-)

To get a sense of perspective, a single malloc() is orders of magnitude more
work that a synchronous jtag_add_dr_out() w/a hardware queue.

I've profiled this extensively, so it's no coincidence that I ended up with
the particular jtag_add_dr_out() syntax. Notice that the first argument
is a constant so with GCC's constant forward propagation, jtag_add_dr_out()
really *can* boil down to poking two hardware registers...


&gt;&gt;<i> Did you look at jtag_add_dr_out() which exists today?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> git format-patch d14b6ca0^...d14b6ca0
</I>
I don't know what you mean by the above against which repository.
