Unfortunately - it is ;)

No, these are two different things. The timer and PWM outputs may (and 
should) continue to work, I just don't want to see their interrupts.

This is exactly what cortex_m3 maskisr on/off does.

We also have some commercial JTAG interfaces in our company, and Hitex' 
HiTop, for example, offers a dialog to selectively disable interrupts 
while stepping.  The timer is left running, but doesn't fire interrupts.

After pressing &quot;run&quot;, interrupts are re-enabled automatically.

So, as David asked: yes, maskisr does solve my problem. It only lacks 
automation.

I would like to use &quot;some OpenOCD GDB events&quot; like Oyvind suggested.. 
but _how_ to do it?!

My goal, after all, is to replace our existing commercial toolchain with 
CodeSourcery/Eclipse/armgnueclipse/OpenOCD without loosing too much comfort.
