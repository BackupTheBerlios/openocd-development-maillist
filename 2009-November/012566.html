That presumes there *is* a target.  We have SVF and XSVF today,
and there can be other tools that work more at the JTAG level.

Plus, it's a bit awkward to be coupling address space access
(memory read/write) to targets, considering that newer ARMs
decouple them (via ADIv5) and so does, ISTR, Nexus.

I'm not entirely sure what you mean to describe though.  I'd
like to see less baroque structures for the JTAG messages,
and one part of that is clearly a need for more efficient
bit vector handling.

Along those lines, $SUBJECT is the wrong model too.  When we
want to work with 64 bit or 128 bit words -- or even just
the 40-bit words common with older ARM stuff -- then we
should be able to just pass those down.  Thinking &quot;8&quot; or
&quot;32&quot; focusses on the wrong stuff ... implementation details,
not the concepts that will produce a better interface.


&gt;<i> The current model does the same but essentially uses a global
</I>&gt;<i> variable. But presumably due to ownership issues the field data is

</I>&gt;<i> owned by the target this (second) copy operation can be avoided as
</I>&gt;<i> well.
</I>
I think I agree with what you're saying there.  JTAG layer
gets delivered a queue, which it processes and modifies
in place (if required).

For extra credit:  some way to package queues with a bit
of intelligence, so they could be downloaded into smarter
controllers.  Example, the polling loops which run in
the background ... or between key steps of high level
operations.
