Which part?  About unsigned?  Or about righting wrongs before 1.0? ;)

</I>
The C library shares the same fundamental flaws for the same reason.
However, I think newer APIs began to use better types, though int vs.
unsigned might prove to be an interesting exception to that rule.

Look at patch 14/20 in the series I posted earlier.  That shows what was
required to sort out the signed/unsigned warnings with gcc-4.3.2 on x86.
If you still have concerns, I suggest applying the series and reporting
your actual results when using different compilers and architectures.

If my reasoning is erroneous, I would love to see the concrete evidence,
and I do not doubt that it exists (one way or the other).  Regardless,
the C library would probably look a lot different, if it was not
cemented by over 35 years of legacy requirements.  Give me a better
standard with which to judge.  For example, What Would Linus Do? :)

I want OpenOCD to shed all legacy baggage before reaching 1.0, in so far
as it makes sense.  Mostly, the code should use the C99 standard, and
the 'unsigned int' type is a frequently overlooked part of that.
The C library must still work with older standards; OpenOCD does not.

Cheers,

Zach
