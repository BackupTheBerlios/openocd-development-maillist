Yeah, I figure there are some scripts (or users) that have not been
sufficiently strict about CONFIG vs. EXEC modes, as that logic has been
broken for ages....  Nevertheless, the very design needs to be improved.

Indeed, this feature presents a layering violation.  Right now, the
command layer knows too much about the state of initialization.  Even a
simple 'enable/disable' state would be a sufficient generalization of
the intended functionality; however, many commands should be registered
only once they can be used, which we do in very small doses today.

Why not allow the user to bring up an interface once its defined?
Specifically, the 'init' command might be a subcommand associated of a
specific (named) interface device instance.  It would give other
commands for configuring the TAPs, devices, and targets associated with
that interface.  Naturally, this implies multiple interface support, so
OpenOCD can support gang-programming and multi-head test applications.

Naturally, it should be possible to run 'init' interactively, such that
one can startup OpenOCD without any interface defined.  That change
should be possible independently of other work in this area.  I seem to
recall the topic being discussed in the past, but I can't find anything
relevant in my local archive after a quick search.

As I see it, the notion of command modes can be eliminated entirely, if
we are careful in how we restructure the command hierarchy.  Indeed, I
should have articulated this impetus in my post on the topic; however,
effecting this all correctly will require tremendous amount of work.
