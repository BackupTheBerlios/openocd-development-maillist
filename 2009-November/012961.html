<PRE>This defines a &quot;reset-assert&quot; event and a supporting utility
routine, and documents both how targets should implement it
and how config scripts should use it.  Core-specific updates
are needed to make this work.
---
This is necessary for supporting reset on boards without SRST.
I'm sending around the three patches that make it work on
BeagleBoard ... and will merge along with similar stuff that
addresses at least one other board which need it.

 Some chips have specific ways the TRST and SRST signals are

+For example, some chips can't support JTAG debugging without
+both signals.

+Provide a @code{reset-assert} event handler if you can.
+Such a handler uses JTAG operations to reset the target,
+letting this target config be used in systems which don't
+provide the optional SRST signal, or on systems where you
+don't want to reset all targets at once.
+Such a handler might write to chip registers to force a reset,
+use a JRC to do that (preferable -- the target may be wedged!),
+or force a watchdog timer to trigger.
+(For Cortex-M3 targets, this is not necessary.  The target
+driver knows how to use trigger an NVIC reset when SRST is
+not available.)
 
 Some chips need special attention during reset handling if
 they're going to be used with JTAG.
