</I>
To conclude this particular conversation with myself, I have pushed
these patches along with a slightly improved version of the series to
split several monolithic jim command handlers.  Try out 'help jtag' and
'help $CHIPNAME.cpu' (or whatever you use).  

In between those two series, I pushed a number of minor command module
cleanup patches, which fell out of this work.  Lastly, I pushed a minor
update to the 'testee' target and added the 'nonce' NAND test driver.
Both of those drivers need further work to be useful for real testing,
but I can define and query new instances with them.

While I think these changes will work fine for everyone, the community
may find problems that I managed to miss.  Please create new threads to
report further problems.  I will post a follow-up shortly with some
ideas for further improvements to the 'help' system.

Cheers,

Zach
