If there's no SRST, then none of the SRST-related settings matter.
Likewise with TRST.  The timings are orthogonal, much like the color
of the sky over your head right now.  So there really aren't as many
options as you suspect...

I don't have any reason to think those don't function as defined.
Except maybe the &quot;trst pulls srst&quot; option, which ISTR was coded more
or less on speculation.


&gt;<i> Back to your question: I tried all of the four signal options, and
</I>&gt;<i> /basically/ all of them work. I can attach log files if needed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;none&quot; and &quot;trst_only&quot;  seem to be the best options -- only one reset,
</I>&gt;<i> or reset-and-immediate-halt, as expected.
</I>
Said differently:  STM32 can use the current Cortex-M3 NVIC reset
logic with no problems.  Good to know.

(Most of the Stellaris parts don't have a TRST signal.  You might
double check to see if your board even uses it.  If not, &quot;none&quot; is
your best answer.  It's the OpenOCD default, too.)

 
&gt;<i> &quot;srst_only&quot; and &quot;trst_and_srst&quot; give double-resets and run-before-halts.
</I>
Pretty much like some of the Stellaris parts.  The issue there
is that SRST is resetting some of the debug logic, but that's
supposed to be left untouched ... according to ARM.  You might
want to consult ST, or the STM32 docs (and errata) to see if
this is viewed as an erratum or just a variance from how ARM
says things should work.

A stop-on-reset flag gets set before SRST, then SRST fires;
and it runs because that stop-on-reset flag (vector catch)
got unexpectedly cleared.
 
 
&gt;<i> But &quot;trst_and_srst&quot; is defined as the default in stm32.cfg .. perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> it's just the wrong reset type?!
</I>
The stm32.cfg shouldn't specify a reset type at all, since
the right configuration depends on what the *board* wires up.
Send a patch in ... :)

There are a handful of targets that can't be debugged without
both SRST and TRST; those are the only ones with any business
providing such a config option in a target config file.
