Depends on what you have hooked up to the trace port.

Best case for current OpenOCD is ETB support, in which
case it's not &quot;N instructions&quot; but &quot;N words of trace data&quot;.
(ETB is the trace buffer, with a few Kwords of data.)

That's best for now because it's just a case of how to
make the current code work, and since there's a lot of
ARM9 (mostly -- but also some ARM11) hardware out there
in users' hands.  Once it's somewhat usable, then users
can give feedback about what's needed/wanted.

(Cortex-M3 tracing is quite a ways out yet.  It needs
the SWD support first.  And the model there will be
somewhat different, since apps can use ITM to feed info
to the trace data stream, while that trimmed-down ETM
is optional...)


&gt;<i> The trick is how to present that in a GUI....
</I>
Actually, the trick is to get it to behave properly first,
on various chips which support tracing!

There are several steps I see.  First verify that ETM works;
it seems to, but with bad ETB hookup it's hard to know.
Second is making sure it hooks up to ETB properly; today it
shuts down shortly after startup.  Third is making sure that
the trace data is properly recovered and interpreted.

Once that works, things like GUIs can start to matter.  There
are vendor products which do that, and their models are worth
examining.
