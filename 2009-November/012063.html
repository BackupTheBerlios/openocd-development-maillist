<PRE>I tested it under IAR EWARM 5.40KS, with GDB Server debug interface.
ARMV7_GDB_HACKS is disabled, vsllink bug(mentioned in my another mail)
fixed, and default_mmu returns ERROR_OK.

When using JTAG, output will be:
Open On-Chip Debugger 0.4.0-dev-00096-g5c602f0-dirty (2009-11-08-00:27)

&quot;Info : The target is not running when halt was requested, stopping GDB. &quot;,
this message is printed when download flash to STM32.
Does such message useful?
