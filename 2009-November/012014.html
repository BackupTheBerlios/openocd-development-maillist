And when you tell OpenOCD to use that IR length, does it work?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Q. How can I correctly identify the IR length, etc ? knowing I have no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; access to documentation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know the exact commands to do this in OpenOCD (hopefully others

</I>
Read the User's Guide ... see what it has to say about autodetection.
This feature is in the 0.3.0 release.

 
&gt;<i> The JTAG standard specifies that the bottom 2 bits of IR are &quot;01&quot; when it 
</I>&gt;<i> is captured, so to work out the IR lengths of the entire chain, step the 
</I>&gt;<i> JTAG TAP to IRSHIFT, via IRCAPTURE, and then clock a long string of 1s 
</I>&gt;<i> into TDI. You should get a string of 1s back, preceded by images of the 
</I>&gt;<i> IRs in the chain, each ending in 01.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For example, if you had a chain with an IR length of 4 followed by an IR 
</I>&gt;<i> length of 6, you should see:
</I>&gt;<i> 11111111111110000010001
</I>&gt;<i> coming back, with right-most digits coming out of TDO first.
</I>
Not quite ... it would end in 1111111111111xxxx01xx01 since
the upper bits are not set.  You could have five 01 patterns
in a row ... or just two zero bits ... etc.  Hard to know for
sure which 01 is the LSB of an IR capture value.


&gt;<i> You may need a tool other than OpenOCD to do this scan, and then plug in 
</I>&gt;<i> the irlength values one you've worked them out.
</I>
OpenOCD is currently doing a fairly dumb scan for IR lengths.
It makes the assumption you made -- that the MSBs are zeroes.
That's not always true though.

When there's a single TAP in the scan chain -- detectable by a
DR scan after reset showing only one IDCODE or BYPASS register
value -- it could do better than that.  Patches accepted.  :)
