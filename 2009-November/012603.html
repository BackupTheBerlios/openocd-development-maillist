This is a misunderstanding due to my imprecise choice of words. I used
target layer to refer to anything that uses the core.c interface to
send JTAG commands. My comment above meant exactly the same thing as
the one you quoted at the end, which I think you understood correctly.

&gt;<i> I'm not entirely sure what you mean to describe though. &#160;I'd
</I>&gt;<i> like to see less baroque structures for the JTAG messages,
</I>&gt;<i> and one part of that is clearly a need for more efficient

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;32&quot; focusses on the wrong stuff ... implementation details,
</I>&gt;<i> not the concepts that will produce a better interface.
</I>
Yes I agree.

&gt;&gt;<i> The current model does the same but essentially uses a global
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> variable. But presumably due to ownership issues the field data is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cloned for that global variable. If the jtag sequence structure is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> owned by the target this (second) copy operation can be avoided as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think I agree with what you're saying there. &#160;JTAG layer
</I>&gt;<i> gets delivered a queue, which it processes and modifies
</I>&gt;<i> in place (if required).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For extra credit: &#160;some way to package queues with a bit
</I>&gt;<i> of intelligence, so they could be downloaded into smarter
</I>&gt;<i> controllers. &#160;Example, the polling loops which run in
</I>&gt;<i> the background ... or between key steps of high level
</I>&gt;<i> operations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Just to clarify the whole issue once more, my proposal was actually
three different things:

1. Making the use of scan_field safer by providing standard handlers
for the most common cases.

This not only helps with the readability and reduces trivial
copy&amp;paste errors. It also makes it much simpler to rewire the
underlying scan_field in a later step.


2. Eliminating the global variable jtag_command_queue.

The existing jtag_add_... commands would remain similar but would
operate on a local copy of the queue. jtag_execute_queue then receives
the pointer to that local copy as parameter instead of using
jtag_command_queue. The last user then disposes of the command queue.

The advantage here is a cleaner modular approach. For example this
makes scripting complex JTAG sequences possible without worrying about
interference from polling. In theory this also allows for the use of
multiple JTAG interfaces. With this approach it is also possible to
offer an asynchronous jtag execution mode (if someone needs such a
nightmare).


3. Break up jtag_add_dr_scan etc.

This works best in tandem with (2). The general idea is not to pass
one array of scan fields but to pass them in separate function calls
(which would mimic, but replace the ones in (1)). To output a 7 bit
field the caller just hands the value to the function and doesn't
bother about allocating space. To turn jtag_add_?r_scan inside out
like this requires its states to be kept somewhere so that
plausibility checks and bypassing can be done. The local copy of the
jtag_command_queue would be ideal for that (although it would also
work by adding even more global variables). The caller then does
something like this:

jtag_queue_t * q = jq_alloc_queue();

jq_statemove(q, TAP_IDLE); /* This is just a placeholder for a good
solution to deal with the fact that the initial TAP state is not known
until jq_execute().  */

jq_set_tap(q, my_tap); /* set the tap to be implied by the following
functions, until the next jq_set_tap() */

jq_ir_scan_start(q);

jq_field_u32_out(q, 5, some_instruction);

jq_dr_scan_start(q);

jq_field_u32_out(q, 7, my_value);
jq_field_u32_outin(q, 3, another_value, &amp;return_value);


jq_execute(q); /* callee frees q and associated data */
