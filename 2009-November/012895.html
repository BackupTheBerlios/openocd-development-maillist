Actually, that's dealt with in the first patches of series 6/6, or did
you have something else in mind?  As far as I can tell, all command
registration is going to be fairly smooth after this series gets pushed,
though I have several ideas for more patches to improve things further.

Yes.  This was a tangled web, and I think my efforts are starting to lay
things out better for both users and developers.  These provide an
excellent foundation for further restructuring the commands, such as
$CHIPNAME.{tap,flash} commands like the existing $CHIPNAME.cpu commands.

Even better, there's actual developer documentation for this facet of
the system now, which I've got in progress for a patch to the end of the
series.  I also just fixed some remaining regressions that slipped in,
which will appear at the end as well.

Cheers,

Zach
