<PRE>I would like to suggest that we aim to increase the turnaround
times for our processes.

We have had a frantic pace of modifying the OpenOCD code and
processes over the last year and we've made a huge amount
of progress.

Today many important decisions are made in less than 24 hours.

Perhaps that was a good thing in the past with OpenOCD being
so immature, but I don't think it's the best thing long term.

Long term I'd like to see that all important decisions have days
to weeks cool-off time to allow maintainers and users to go away
for a week or so without returning to a dozen fait accompli's.

It would be good if we used the 0.4 time frame to get the
community used to the idea of longer turnaround times.
Say we aim to go from a few hours to ~2 &quot;working days&quot;,
i.e. no cheating by posting stuff just before major holidays :-)
Generally anyone asking for more time for a particular
change should be heard.

In the last couple of days we've seen how successful branched
development have been with git already(Yes. I saw the light
eventually...) There is now much  less of a disadvantage of
maintaining new features off the master branch.  I'm hopeful we
can train the community to *test* these non-master branches
as well eventually...

I think such a move could help attract and keep knowledgeable
developers.
