Current release is 0.3.0 ... I removed RC0 since I anticipated
confusion, and anyone who really needs it can just grab the
equivalent from git.  We're not Linux; we don't need to leave
release candidates around.

Agreed, release numbering is teh suxxor.  As you noted, two of
the digits are effectively meaningless.

Changing it for this release was not in the cards.  However ...
the January release could change that.

I kind of like the U-Boot release naming scheme ... &quot;v2009.11&quot;
for this month's release-to-be.  &quot;v2009.11-rc1&quot; for the first
release candidate (9 days ago, FWIW).

Also, I'd like to see &quot;openocd -v&quot; report a version code that
directly corresponds to some &quot;git describe&quot; output even during
the merge window.  Fixing that requires changing the release
numbering scheme...

p.s:

&gt;<i> Why don't we name a release 0.3.0, make it public, fix errors for a
</I>&gt;<i> week, release 0.3.1, fix errors for next week then &#160;release 0.3.2, if
</I>&gt;<i> there are no errors add some features and release 0.3.3...
</I>
I don't recall ever seeing any project which works that way.
Micro version numbers are for bugfix releases.  At any rate,
for as long as this project has documented how it numbers its
releases, that has *NOT* been the scheme it uses.


&gt;<i> if there 
</I>&gt;<i> are releases where only the middle number changes, why to use others?
</I>
Right; we don't use major or micro, so there's IMO no point
in having them be part of every release.


&gt;<i> By the way - is 0.3.0 supposed to be an unstable release while the
</I>&gt;<i> 0.4.0 is the next stable release (as in Linux kernel numbering)?
</I>
Ever since 2.6 came out, Linux abandoned that scheme.  That's
quite a few years ago now.  You need to be more current.  :)


&gt;<i> Is 
</I>&gt;<i> all these numbers really necessary? Does anybody have control over
</I>&gt;<i> these numbers?
</I>
If the community wanted, we *could* fix this mess for the
upcoming release...
