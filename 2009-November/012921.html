We saw contrary feedback not that long ago, though:  that
a lot of time was being wasted recreating the same command
queues repeatedly.

Why would running from a queue cause inefficiency?  I've
often seen the opposite.  Minimally, having the commands
already lined up and ready to go means there's not going
to be time wasted between steps, calculating the next one.
So there's an immediate latency win.

At some level, executing from a prepared queue, rather than
computing C[i] and executing X[i] the steps one at a time,
is just time shifting:

  sigma(i, C[i]) + sigma(i, X[i]) == sigma(i, C[i] + X[i])

However, splitting the compute and execute stages lets
them be individually optimized ... and also opens the
door to the &quot;reuse the queue&quot; mode, reducing the time
for subsequent queue runs to just sigma(i, X[i]).  That
means more of those operations can be performed in the
same time ... e.g. polling a register.  (If the C and
X costs are the same, polling would be twice as fast.)
