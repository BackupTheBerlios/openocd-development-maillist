FWIW, I intend to remove some of the 'bool' command helper code from
arm11.c, put it to command.c, then reuse it throughout the system.  That
will allow all commands that parse on/off, enable/disable, go/stop
arguments to share the same helper function (like the number parsing),
eliminating another chunk of code bloat.  

So, yes, you are correct in saying there is other bloat that can be
trimmed there, but my example is low-hanging fruit in comparison to the
ARM utilities.

</I>
Splitting is good for so many reasons: assuring full review, reordering
(or dropping) unwanted changes, merging and rebasing, and bisecting for
problems.  All of these activities are easier if we push only discrete
patches, each of which makes one specific change to the system.  

Git makes it easy to develop such series without any extra tools, though
it does require the self-discipline to pursue this methodology.  I do
know that my own patches are better due to these processes, as I can
revise them with the benefit of hindsight after finishing the series.

Otherwise, it looks like it's a good direction for that code to take.

Cheers,

Zach
