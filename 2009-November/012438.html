I'm wondering what an interface would look like that allowed
other ARM cores -- not just ARM11 -- to do this.  And whether
there shouldn't be a followon patch to make watchpoints use
the same hardware mechanism...


ARM11 seems to have this mechanism built into the core, while
(if I didn't miss something important while skimming) older
cores may not have this mechanism at all.

But starting with ETMv2 (which includes ARM11!) the ETM may
have up to three &quot;context ID&quot; comparators.  Combine one of
those with an address comparator and use that to trigger
entry to debug state, and you've just built a breakpoint
that's *also* a &quot;context aware breakpoint&quot;.  (I think that
with a richly-enough featured ETM, it could implement two
such break-or-watch-points.)

Can you clarify ...  coprocessor #15 register 13 access
can give either the &quot;Fast Context Switch Extension PID&quot;
or a &quot;Context ID&quot;.  The context you're exposing here is
the low byte of the &quot;Context ID&quot;, right?

Meaning there are *two* ways to implement this specific
breakpoint functionality ... yes?  One of which is
specific to ARM11, another of which is more generic.


If that's true ... I suggest refactoring this just a bit,
based on some patches I'm about to send:

 - Have it be an &quot;arm asid [N]&quot; command, not &quot;arm11 asid&quot;,
   and update a field in the &quot;struct arm&quot;.  Do something
   sane for cores that don't support this mechanism,
   like a clean failure.

 - The ARM11 breakpoint code would presumably still work
   like in your patch, but it'd collect state from a
   different place (so the same command could work for
   other cores with this functionality).

Eventually the current notion of breakpoint/watchpoint
may need to evolve, but doing it like I sketched above
seems like it would help us get to that point sooner
by allowing e.g. Cortex-A8, or possibly very modern ARM9
cores, to implement this same mechanism.

- Dave

p.s. One thing that needs fixing in this patch:  it
     shares &quot;arm11_asid&quot; between all ARM11 cores.
     This should be a core-specific value.


&gt;<i> [NOTE] setting one BRP to be compared against context id precludes it
</I>&gt;<i> from &#160;being used as a regular breakpoint. For example on ARM1176zjf-s
</I>&gt;<i> we have 6 BPR's including 2 context aware BPR's. This gives us 6
</I>&gt;<i> breakpoints in total and only 5 when one set &#160;'arm asid &lt;num&gt;' to sth
</I>&gt;<i> different than 0.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [NOTE] ASID is not the same as PID on Linux platform. One cannot
</I>&gt;<i> assume that 'arm asid 1020' will let him debug process with pid=1020.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead one must expose to user land ASID - PID relation via procfs,
</I>&gt;<i> sysfs or other means (patch can be posted on request).
