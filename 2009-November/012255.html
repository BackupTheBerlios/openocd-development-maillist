And what happened to that more standard Tcl model I mentioned a
while back ... a series of interpreters, with the current target
object at the front of the series, and more global stuff back at
the end?

I'm quite sure that was one of the ways folk did objects in Tcl
back a few years.  Interpreters in Tcl are supposed to be light
weight scopes.  Currently we make them be heavy-weight, and that
creates some impedence mismatches...

On the other hand ... for big things, it's best to avoid
turning fuzzy ideas into C.  There's a risk of tha fuzziness
getting committed, and then getting hard to remove.
