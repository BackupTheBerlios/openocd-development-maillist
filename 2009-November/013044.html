It was allowing all commands to run during CONFIG stage, regardless of
whether they were marked EXEC-only.  Broken.

&gt;<i> &gt; Nevertheless, the very design needs to be improved. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Indeed, this feature presents a layering violation.  Right now, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; command layer knows too much about the state of initialization.  Even a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; simple 'enable/disable' state would be a sufficient generalization of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the intended functionality; however, many commands should be registered
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only once they can be used, which we do in very small doses today.

</I>
I had a patch to do exactly this, but I think I dropped it.   It's a
two-liner though.

&gt;<i> &gt; Why not allow the user to bring up an interface once its defined?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Specifically, the 'init' command might be a subcommand associated of a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specific (named) interface device instance.  It would give other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; commands for configuring the TAPs, devices, and targets associated with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that interface.  Naturally, this implies multiple interface support, so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OpenOCD can support gang-programming and multi-head test applications.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not keen on that.  It already supports multiple scanchains ... just
</I>&gt;<i> put each one in its own process.  That's not something that's broken.
</I>&gt;<i> Not that I'd object hugely to having it; but it just seems like it would
</I>&gt;<i> only increase complexity, to no real benefit.
</I>
Multiple processes will not allow easy synchronization when testing
targets that are connected via multiple interfaces and to each other.
Moreover, it's far more difficult to start two processes: you have to
set their server ports manually, or they conflict.  One process is the
way to go for testing scenarios that require multiple interfaces.

And it should eliminate 99% of the global variables in the jtag module.
Proper encapsulation of that layer would be a real benefit in my eyes.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; Naturally, it should be possible to run 'init' interactively, such that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one can startup OpenOCD without any interface defined.  That change
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should be possible independently of other work in this area.  I seem to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recall the topic being discussed in the past, but I can't find anything
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; relevant in my local archive after a quick search.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As I see it, the notion of command modes can be eliminated entirely,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes it could be.  But right now we're faced with just a regression,
</I>&gt;<i> where adding
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	-c init -c &quot;poll off&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> to a working comand line causes things to fail.
</I>
When I started to look into this, I decided to start a new series that
factors the init process into several fine-grain commands.  The current
command does _far_ too many things under the covers, making policies
when it should be offering mechanisms.

For example, the gdb_init routine can be factored into routines that
allows starting an GDB server associated with a target at any time.
While this work can retain the current syntax, the underlying mechanisms
will be prepared to switch to a more policy-neutral command language.
