<PRE>Logs are too big for the mailing list. Below is my e-mail without logs.

Hi &#216;yvind,

Attached are the logs for 2645 and 2646. Hope it helps!

I did testing on the following revisions:
0.2.0: works
0.3.0-rc: broken
SVN1399: works
SVN2600: works
SVN2617: works
SVN2636: works
SVN2638: works
SVN2641: works
SVN2643: works
SVN2644: works
SVN2645: works
SVN2646: broken
SVN2656: broken

It appears that SVN2646 did break it.

Best regards,
Pieter

&gt;<i> SVN 2645: writes 512k to flash, verifies correctly
</I>&gt;<i> SVN 2646: flash write_image fails with &quot;timed out while waiting for target debug-running&quot;
</I>
Hmm..... this is trickier than I thought....

Can you provide debug_level 3 logs for 2645 and 2646?

Try to use the *EXACT* same procedure so the logs can be diff'ed
using text diff... (With a bit of manual tinkering...)

I see from the log that the the hardware breakpoint is set correctly and
that the CPU halts at the address after the DCC algorithm(0x850). The DCC
algorithm should run indefinitely until halted when all data has
been written to memory...

I'm stumped as to what this might have to do with 2645 and 2646.... Except
if hw breakpoints were *broken* somehow in 2645 and that hides
some other problem that 2645 is somehow able to recover from....
I/D caches appear to be disabled...

Is it conceivable that 2645 is in fact broken too and that something conspired
to make the test come out as a false positive?
