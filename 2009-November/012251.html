<PRE>Hi All,

I am working a few hours a week trying to get SWD working for the STM32
Primer2 (R-Link interface). I am happy making changes to the source code
to accomplish this. The problem is that my changes span many files
because OpenOCD is pretty well married up to JTAG. I am taking the
opportunity to create an interface struct that can be type-cast to JTAG
or SWD struct and later extended to UART. The problem I've got is that I
know nothing about git and get problems trying to pull the latest
revisions and merging them with my working copy. I try

$ git pull
Updating e901cee..2821115
error: Entry 'src/jtag/core.c' not uptodate. Cannot merge.

and it tells me it can't merge. I suspect that I will run into further
problems as my working copy continues to drift away from the master so I
would like to resolve this soon. I know the problem lies with me not
understanding git, so help is appreciated. The tutorial didn't help me
resolve the above.

The patch that I will eventually post will be quite big, is this going
to be a problem for the person who merges the patch into the master?

Regards
Andrew
