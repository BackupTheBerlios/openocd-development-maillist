I think having the supported processors listed in the code (i.e. TCL
commands) is a good idea.  It's easier to keep up to date and people
working on the C code will know which processors they support.  If this
is maintained as a simple table in C or TCL then more users can easily
submit patches when they find a new device supported by one of the
existing targets.

That said I think we should also keep a list in the documentation even
if it might get out of date.  The docs would of course refer to the TCL
commands to get the most current list.

If the C tables are formatted appropriately we could extract the
supported targets list from the C code and generate output in texi
format as part of the build process.  Then the list in the documentation
will always be up to date.  I don't know much about the .texi format but
this would easiest to implement if it has an include command.  Then each
target list could be processed into a unique .texi file which is
included from the main document.


Cheers,
John McC.
