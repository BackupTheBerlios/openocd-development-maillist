<PRE>I believe the following is a reasonable summery of where we are.

-Duane.

=================================
(a)   There is little to no ram what so ever in the target.
=================================
  
Option 1
       Duane feels there is always 4K or more.
       Others point out 4K is not always there.
      
       Solutions to that problem are: SDRAM can be configured
       If SDRAM cannot be configured (it is to hard) CACHE
       could be configured by openocd.

       Again - going back to the &quot;big chip verse little chip&quot;
       Little chips have the ram built in.
       Big chips - have external (sdram) and I believe &quot;cache&quot;

    Advantage:
          With more RAM comes more flexibility

    Disadvantage:
          Configuring SDRAM for some is hard to figure out.
          Configuring CACHE - is not something supported today.

    The question becomes: What is 'reasonable'.

Option 2
       Others do not, and want this to work in some smaller size.
       How big? The expression seems to be &quot;bytes&quot; of code.

       Advantage:
          Fits in more places
       Disadvantage:
          Many 'purpose built' sequences.

=================================
(b)   Opcode/Bytecode/Interpretor or Purpose Built
=================================

Option (3)
       Purpose Built is what exists today - and others do not like this.

       I (duane) define purpose built as: Code that is written for 
exactly one purpose and no other purpose.
       One would load code to do an erase-chip, another chunk of code to 
do page program.
       Etc ...

       Perhaps - cleaning up and making the purpose built more generic 
is a solution.
        Functionally this means: A generic front end.

       Advantage:
          (cleaning up) Simplifies the front end

       Disadvantage:
          X * Y * Z = total number of solutions
          X combinations for Y chips or Z targets.

Option (4)

       Is the byte code interpretor approach.
       In this scheme, the &quot;blob&quot; is downloaded once.
       That blob &quot;loops&quot;.
       At each &quot;loop&quot; one or both get downloaded/updated
           (A) new byte code sequences
           (B) data in bunk.
       The &quot;blob&quot; is resumed and it loops.
   
       Advantage:
             Opcode stream is cross platform
             Complexity of writing &quot;sequences&quot;

       Disadvantage:
             Blob Size is larger.
             TBD - how large &quot;large is&quot;
