<PRE>Hi,

the first two patches add support for UnlockBypass programming mode for
the Spansion flash.  According to the AMD datasheet this is supported by
3.3v AMD/Spansion flashes as well as the Samsung flash in my WRT54GL and
it gives a 45-50% speedup over the regular programming sequence.
Neither of these flashes support Buffered programming mode so the
previous Spansion cfi_spansion_write_words() patch doesn't help them.
The patch will allow Buffered mode in preference to UnlockBypass mode if
present in a particular flash device.

I used a hack to allow the buffered write code to work with UnlockBypass
mode.  Is this alright or do someone have a better suggestion on how
this should be done (see comment in code)?

Also, there are some older AMD flashes (e.g 5v) that apparently don't
support this programming mode which I expect will break with this patch.
I don't see any easy way to detect these flash types except by CFI id.
Any suggestions on how to handle this in my patch?

The simplest fix would be to add another option to the cfi flash type to
enable or disable this feature, leaving it up to the end user to figure
out if their flash supports UnlockBypass mode.

Messier would be to build a table of CFI id's with/without this mode.
I don't have the info to build this table except for the few flash
devices I've got data sheets for.

Suggestions?

The second flash makes a number of cfi flash routines return errors that
could be suppressed.


Cheers,
John McC.
