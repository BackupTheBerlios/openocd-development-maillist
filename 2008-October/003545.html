<PRE>(#1)

I seem to have a reoccurring problem getting oocd to build on freebsd,
because we keep our includes in /usr/local/include instead of
/usr/include.  Six months ago, configure
--includedir=/usr/local/include worked like a charm, but now it
doesn't.  If I manually add -I$(includedir) to INCLUDES in all the
makefiles, suddenly ftdi.h gets located correctly again.

If this is the correct fix (I'm no expert on configure), could I get
it committed to svn?  I assume that Makefile.in gets it, right?

(#2) same issue:

guess-rev.sh specifies #!/bin/bash; it should come as no suprise that
we keep our bash in /usr/local/bin/bash (that I disagree with, because
it causes problems with other things, but it's the way it is).  I
changed to #!bash and it did find bash on my system, I don't know if
this is legal or not...

Thanks,
Steve
