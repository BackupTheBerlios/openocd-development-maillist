Yea, I plan to do that it just looks messy since it doesn't look like I
can auto detect this (there is no indication in the CFI tables when
UnlockBypass is supported that I can see).

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I would like to limit parameters in the config file to those absolutely needed - ie. the user should not need to configure things that can be auto-detected. I regularly work with boards where one of a series of allowed flashs may be used as alternatives, and is is annoying if I need to edit the config file every time I switch between two boards of the same kind.
</I>
I agree but will probably include a config option for when the whitelist
is missing your part so you can enable UnlockBypass if you know it's
supported.  I'd rather it be automatic but at present don't see how to
to do that (other than the whitelist of course).

Thanks for the feedback.


Cheers,
John McC.
