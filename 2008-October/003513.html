<PRE>Hi Michael,

Thanks for your reply.

&gt;<i> Seems reasonable - debugging/developing bootloader code without a JTAG
</I>&gt;<i> debugger is a real PITA (BTDT).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The platform I am looking for is IXP435/432. I am wanting to use the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MAJIC JTAG from MentorGraphics/ EPI. see the link below. My company
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; brought this JTAG 3 years back and missing with the licence information.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Will I be able to use it with openOCD in thsi case?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am afraid not. The Majic is a complete JTAG-to-Ethernet debug adapter
</I>&gt;<i> that does most of what openocd does inside the Majic box, so you just need
</I>&gt;<i> the debugger (you might check which debuggers are supported - maybe gdb can
</I>&gt;<i> directly talk to the box?). If gdb does not work, then the box can probably
</I>&gt;<i> only be used by getting a license for a supported debugger.
</I>
Yes, this is a MAJIC-MT Box and it has support for GDB.
What I understand from this is, a processor with a in-circuit emulator can
be debugged using the MAGIC JTAG or openOCD+WIGGLE. Both of these need some
of kind of debugger(i.e. GDB client) on the host.
Question: As openOCD connects to the hardware just through couple of wires
and nothing else, with the OpenOCD expect that there is GDB server running
on the device. If not, how is it communication with the target hardware?
just curious......

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD's purpose is to replace boxes like the Majic: it only requires some
</I>&gt;<i> simple JTAG adapter (either a simple parallel-port wiggler, FTDI2232-bases
</I>&gt;<i> USB, or similar solutions - the supported adapters should be listed in the
</I>&gt;<i> manual).
</I>

So does that mean that both OpenOCD and JTAG boxes are different entities
without depending on each other to support for debugging of the embedded
hardware.
OpenOCD does more of the software Job whereas JTAG boxes are also capable of
doing PCB layout validations and other hardware stuff.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I visited the link below and found some information about IXPs. The text
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the site does NOT mention that it supports IXP432/35. But is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specifically mentions the following sentence.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://openfacts.berlios.de/index-en.phtml?title=OpenOCD_configuration">http://openfacts.berlios.de/index-en.phtml?title=OpenOCD_configuration</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      xscale options
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         Supported variants are 'ixp42x', 'ixp45x', 'ixp46x', 'pxa250',
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 'pxa255', 'pxa26x'.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does it mean that OpenOCD does not support for IXP432/35 chips and so it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is not listed in the Xscale list. If it the case, what kind of effort
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will be involved to get it working.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think nobody tested it yet.
</I>&gt;<i> From a short look, all IXP variants use the same code in OpenOCD, so
</I>&gt;<i> chances are good that the IXP43x &quot;just works&quot; when using a IXP42X config (of
</I>&gt;<i> course you may need to modify the configuration regarding hardware
</I>&gt;<i> initialization, eg. SDRAM).
</I>

If the JTAG does not work out for some reason, can I quickly jump back to
OpenOCD with a parallel port wiggle to get it working.
In this case, I might want to know what kind of parameters do I need to tune
to get stuff like this working?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have a very short deadline to develop the complete USB stack for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Redboot and the JTAG interface would help me the best in this couase.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But, at the sam time I cannot spend days fighting to get the JTAG
</I>&gt;<i> working.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You might also take a look at u-boot - I am not sure about the status of
</I>&gt;<i> u-boot's USB stack, but maybe switching the bootloader gives a faster
</I>&gt;<i> result. Porting u-boot to a new board where the IXP CPU is already supported
</I>&gt;<i> sounds easier to me that adding a whole USB stack to redboot, but &quot;your
</I>&gt;<i> mileage may vary&quot;.
</I>

I see that U-boot does not have support for USB Host either. Even if I do
support the U-boot on my board, I will end up doing the USB again. And
seriously for all this stuff to get the USB host working, I only have a
month from now.
