I disagree, I think we always have 4K of ram, here's why:

Generally:
    There are two classes of devices.
    1) Those with internal flash. 
    2) Those with external flash.

Assertion:
    During &quot;flash programing&quot;, openocd controls the world and the chip.
    And - there is &quot;ram to be had some where&quot; that openocd can use.

Assertion:
    The target here is *NOT* embedded &quot;8051&quot; or 'tiny pic' or 'tiny avr' 
type micro controllers
    Those have their own flash programing solutions - and debug tools.
    We are not trying to solve those problems here with openocd.

Assertion:
    OpenOCD targets are a 16/32bit chips with JTAG and a recent vintage.
    (Yea, I know there are 6502 ports for GCC...)

Assertion:
    The target uses GCC and/or GDB.

Assertion:
    Anything matching the above - is either
        (1) a micro controller with internal flash (and ram) or
        (2) has external memory that can be configured some how.
    (ie: maybe to config ram, one must write a sequence of 'mww' commands)

Assertion:
    Anything with internal flash is a micro controller and will be 
purpose built, and perhaps &quot;just weird&quot;.

Assertion:
    The issue here is *external* flash.
    Flash that is common across multiple targets.

I believe the above assertions are true.

Does anybody disagree? If so - why?

If they are true - then - I believe we can easily claim &quot;4K&quot; is reasonable.
With 4K - the little &quot;blob&quot; of code can be quite powerful.
Even if we must limit it to 2K - there are some simplistic methods one 
can accomplish.
