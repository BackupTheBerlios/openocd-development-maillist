As I know now, it's a bit more complicated.

1) The bitbanging code sampled the data at the wrong time. My inital patch
destroyed the written data, as the buffer is used for read and write...

2) The first device in the chain is non-compliant, its DR has 256bits. If
you know that it's absolutely clear that the specification says something
about 256bits ;-) Although not necessary, I've hacked the detection with a
device limit, I don't want &gt;200 error messages at startup. I guess it would
be good to add an option to jtag_device for a different DR length.

3) The ARM11 (or maybe the other targets...) gets easily confused when
fiddling with the bits and registers and its JTAG-TAP goes dead until power
removal. Even TLR doesn't help, an explicitly addressed IDCODE gives no more
answer beyond the data stored at TLR. I accidently found this out when
probing the signals during repeating scans.

I will post a patch for the bitbanging stuff later.

Now I'm into flashing. As I've found out, there's currently no fast flash
algorithm for ARM11... I'm trying to port the ARM4/5-stuff for
run_algorithm, but it looks like the SW infrastructure in arm11.c is
different to the other ARMs (no core_cache, etc.). Is there a subtle reason
for that I'm still missing?

Also there was no buffer flash mode for Spansion flashes (I have great luck
falling in all openocd gaps ;-) ), so flashing was veeery slow (~20Bytes/s).
I've implemented the buffer mode (patch follows), now it's about 1kB/s over
parport with its slow 300kHz clock rate. Not really fast, but acceptable for
a start and enough to prove that the flash actually works.
