</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; has anyone got OpenOCD working with a Faraday FA526 processor (actually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; a Raritan Kira100 which uses a FA526 processor)?  It appears to be an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; ARM926 variant but apparently not exactly.  Does this require target
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; specific support or am I just missing some configuration?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I doubt it is an ARM926 - I think it is an ARM920.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; ARM926 = uses ARMv6 instruction set.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Says it is an &quot;ARMV4T&quot; instruction set which would imply - ARM920 ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Unfortunately, the arm20t behaves even worse that the arm926 target:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [... snip ...]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm sure I read somewhere (I think it was for the WinBond BMC which also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; uses a Faraday FA526) that it is an ARM926ejs but I'd need to recheck my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; facts to be sure.  In either case, OpenOCD is currently not happy using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; either arm920t or arm926ejs with the Kira100.  I'll see if the WinBond
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; behaves any better (though I'm not too hopeful).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; John McCarthy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe Faraday is one of the few architecture licensees, like Intel or 
</I>&gt;<i> Marvell, i.e. they're producing processors based on cores they developed 
</I>&gt;<i> themselves, rather than integrating one of the existing cores in a SOC.
</I>
Yes, that is my understanding as well.

&gt;<i> Did you try plain arm7tdmi? The arm920t and arm926ejs targets try to talk to 
</I>&gt;<i> the system coprocessor, which is a lot more implementation specific.
</I>
I've tried them all with varying breakage levels.  arm926ejs seemed to
give the least errors (on reset/halt anyway) but couldn't do mem I/O.  I
have yet to take a closer look at which target 'should' work with the
Faraday.  The Faraday docs seem to indicate they support ARMv4 and I
don't know anything about their coprocessor support at present (or how
this differs in the Raritan or WindBond SoC chips that use the FA526
processor).  I'm also not super familiar with the details of the
different ARM variants so I have some learning to do there when I can
get some time.  Is there a reference anywhere that summarizes the
differences between the different ARM variants supported in OpenOCD?

&gt;<i> Someone from Faraday contacted me earlier this year, but apparently he never 
</I>&gt;<i> sent his patches to the list. I'll see if I can contact him, maybe he's 
</I>&gt;<i> willing to send the patches to one of you for integration in the current 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD code (his work was based on some 100+ revision...).
</I>
That would be great.  I'd be willing to spend some time on that for
sure.

&gt;<i> Regards,

</I>&gt;<i> Dominic

Thanks,
John McC.
