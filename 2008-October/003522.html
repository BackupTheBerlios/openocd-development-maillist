Correct.

&gt;<i> Question: As openOCD connects to the hardware just through couple of

There is special debug circuitry in the CPU that is accessed via the JTAG pins, so usually no software (gdb stub or other) is required on the target. 
You can start up a board with emtpy flash rom and no code at all, and download/debug via JTAG.

The gdb server that talks to your gdb is in openocd (or in the Majic box).

On the IXP (different than on other ARM CPUs), a small debug handler is downloaded to the CPU - however, this is handled mostly transparently by OpenOCD, and the code resides in a special mini-instruction cache that is on the CPU for only that purpose, so your own application running on the target won't really notice. For size constraints, this debug handler is not a gdb stub, but a very minimal stub that talks to OpenOCD, and OpenOCD translates that to gdb protocol. On other ARM CPUs, the debug protocol is implemented in hardware without such a stub.

&gt;<i> So does that mean that both OpenOCD and JTAG boxes are different
</I>&gt;<i> entities without depending on each other to support for debugging of the
</I>&gt;<i> embedded hardware.
</I>
Yes an No.

OpenOCD requires some simple adapter to connect to the JTAG pins of the target.
Boxes like Majic or BDI2000 pack the combination (JTAG interface, target debug code, gdb stub) into a single box that can be accessed via ethernet.

&gt;<i> OpenOCD does more of the software Job whereas JTAG boxes are also
</I>&gt;<i> capable of doing PCB layout validations and other hardware stuff.
</I>
JTAG can be used for those jobs - it depends on the host what it is used for. OpenOCD, Majic, BDI2000 etc. only perform debugging via JTAG.

&gt;<i> If the JTAG does not work out for some reason, can I quickly jump back
</I>&gt;<i> to OpenOCD with a parallel port wiggle to get it working.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In this case, I might want to know what kind of parameters do I need to
</I>&gt;<i> tune to get stuff like this working?
</I>
I have only worked on IXP42X, so I can't really tell. You will need to modify the hardware initialization in the scripts that OpenOCD used, look eg. at the xba_revA3.cfg and the init script xba_revA3.script for an IXP425 example.

&gt;<i> I see that U-boot does not have support for USB Host either. 
</I>
In that case, go with the bootloader you already have on your board.
