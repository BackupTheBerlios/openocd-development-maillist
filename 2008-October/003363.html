I'm curious what went wrong.  I know git formats the patches a little
differently but I used --no-prefix so that you should have been able to
apply these with a 'patch -p0 &lt; xxx.patch' from the OpenOCD top level
dir.  How do you normally apply SVN patches?  Just curious.

&gt;<i> Could you sync up w/svn trunk &amp; submit it as a SVN patch?
</I>
Yes I can do that. I use git-svn for my local development so sending
patches formatted from git would be much faster for me.  But I can apply
them to my local SVN checkout to generate SVN patches if that is what
you need.

&gt;<i> Also if you could roll in all the changes to the mips stuff in a single patch
</I>&gt;<i> that would be great!
</I>
Some of these patches were separated out to get comments and I'll keep
them separate till they are finalized.  I'll roll-up the rest and
recreate them as SVN patches against trunk.

&gt;<i> (I think GIT is really neat, but for now the consensus is to use SVN for
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD...)
</I>
I use git-svn with our SVN repository at work and it works great.
However that is committing directly into our SVN repository with git-svn
rather than generating patches.  I find git-svn provides a much better
environment for managing multiple patches in parallel which I find
really improves my efficiency.


Cheers,
John McC.
