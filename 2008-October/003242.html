<PRE>Oyvind/Georg,

I see you both are talking about the flash algorithm support in openocd.

There is a few tricks that I see that could be done to simplify the 
situation.

To communicate with a &quot;flash driver&quot; - first - do not call it a flash 
driver.
Call it an 'execution engine' you'll understand why I say this - below.

I have seen other solutions - far nastier - used by various debuggers.
The other solutions assume (a) you can lookup symbols, (b) and many 
other things.

-Duane.

===================================

(A) Take a page from the &quot;arm-semi-hosting&quot;.

The code for OpenOCD to talk to a target resident chunk of code is simple.

In arm, the entry point code would look like this:

#=======================

entrypoint:
    adr   sp, stack_top
    mov   r0,#0 // code 0 = initialize.
again:
    adr   r1, the_table
    bl      C_handler
    // r0 = holds the result
    adr   r1,the_table
    bkpt
    b      again
the_table:
    .space  (32*4)
stack_bottom:
    .space (256)
stack_top:

#=======================

The idea is this:

1) OpenOCD loads a binary at some location in memory (hopefully it is 
all position independent code :-)

2) OpenOCD then sets the program counter at byte 0 of that binary. And 
resumes.

In the case of ARM... @ startup, the ASM code:

3) sets the stack pointer,
4) sets R0 - in the case of ARM, the 1st parameter.
5) sets R1 - the 2nd parameter - a pointer to a table.
6) ASM code calls some C function.
7) The C function in this case, because R0=0, it &quot;initializes the table&quot;.
8) the C function returns.
9) the breakpoint is hit.
10) OpenOCD can find the table via R0/R1
11) OpenOCD rd/wr the table as needed.
12) If needed, set R0 to next command
13) Resume, code loops and hits bkpt again.
14) repeat until done.

ARM SWI works the same basic way
R0/R1 =&gt; an integer + a pointer, the return result is in R0.

The above should be *VERY* easy to make work on just about any platform. 
Including non-arm targets.

For ARM targets, you only need 2 - maybe 3 variants of the binary.
And - perhaps the binary code could be 'position independent'

The variants would be:

1) ARM7 based ARM code
  (solves all armv4, armv5 and I believe armv6 targets)
2) CORTEX_M3 (thumb2 code, ie: armv7?)
3) Others? ie: arm11? Or other thumb2 wackiness?

#=======================

----
Option #1 - it is purpose written, it does exactly one thing.
----

You load new code each time, (like today)

Advantage:
    each code piece is tiny.
Disadvantage:
    It is a multiplication problem for all targets.
   ie: X chips *times* Y platforms.
    Plus - host side support.

----
Option #2 - is a small 'opcode engine'.
----

OpenOCD writes a sequence of commands into a buffer.
The C code interprets those commands.
The C code returns, with a result in R0.

Disadvantage:
    The &quot;interpretor&quot; might be as large as 4K bytes.
    ie: Maybe a 8K target foot print.

Advantage:
    It is an X + Y solution.

ie: The Code is written once for each platform.
ie: The Command sequence is written once for each chip.

And - the host side support is already very abstracted.
ie: target write/read memory, and &quot;set register&quot; is the baseline support.

-----

Option #2 can also be extended to SPI flash programing.
ie: Things like the AT91SAM9 - can boot from spi flash.

One could download &quot;spi flash&quot; driver code to the target - much the 
manor and style.
Then - using the same type of interface, send SPI flash commands through 
the same target interface.

This would allow the SPI hardware side to be target specific.
And the &quot;SPI-CHIP&quot; to be target independent.

-----

Option #2 could also be extended another way for &quot;production purposes&quot;.

For example - one could write a target or &quot;chip family&quot; specific chunk 
of code that does GPIO pins to blink an LED when done programing.

Atmel's SAM-ICE has this nice feature.

-Duane.
