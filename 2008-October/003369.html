It worked now.

Committed.

W.r.t. GIT&amp;SVN this is not about you. I'm not one bit worried about you because
you seem to be highly productive anyway ;-)

Though it doesn't matter what tools you use as long as the patches:

- have a svn # so we know which version you're patching against
- they apply with problems
- there aren't multiple patches to the same file in different patch files



I think GIT is as neat as the next guy, but the rules of the game for
OpenOCD is not to make changes without a consensus. Changes
include tools, procedures or implementation of OpenOCD...

Source control is an especially tricky thing to change as well... my main
battle in everyday life is to get developers to use *any* source control.
Switching from one to another is a titanic battle... I'm working on a project
where RCS is alive and well(with gobs of scripting on top...). I'd like
to change that one to CVS, SVN or GIT, but it ain't going to happen
because of little me wanting a source control system which is *only*
one or two decades old :-)

I'd like to use C++ in OpenOCD, but C++ and the people with the deeply
embedded skills do not overlap much... it could result in a *very* select
group of developers that could work on OpenOCD :-)
