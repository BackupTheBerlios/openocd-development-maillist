<PRE>John McCarthy&gt;  I've got an ARM926EJ-S

A bit more detail about the actual chip would be helpful. (arm926 is the 
core) but who makes the chip?
Only thing I find that names &quot;flash integration unit&quot; is a freescale thing.

John McCarthy&gt;  Could anyone give me a high level description on what 
would be needed to add this support and how it should be integrated into 
OpenOCD?

Hmm, generally OpenOCD sees memory as having an address and data bus.

SPI flash - is not a traditional &quot;bus&quot; - it is a serial protocol. But 
you say this:

John McCarthy&gt;  The FIU on the ARM926EJ-S maps the SPI flash to the ARM 
address space
John McCarthy&gt; starting at address 0x40000000 so it reads like ordinary 
memory.

Sounds like a hardware state machine of some sort. - Quit strange.

John McCarthy&gt;Is this a common way to interface SPI flash to a processor?

no - it is not a standard in way that I am familiar with - ie:  on 
pic32, arm, blackfin, in some ways it sounds like the &quot;one-nand&quot; that 
has a small XIP buffer for booting - but not really.

John McCarthy&gt; [ so how do I hook it up to openocd? ]

Good question. This FIU mode is going to be silicon vendor specific 
beyond all possible ways.

You are correct - from the stand point of the spi flash - the commands 
should be mostly generic. However :-( the SPI controller is different on 
every platform and every platform implementation, for example I might 
connect it to SPI port 2, using GPIO 42 as the chip select - and you 
might use the *SAME* arm chip as me - but use SPI port 1 - and SPICS3 as 
the control signal.

All hope is not lost - there is a way - I think - but it will seem ass 
backwards to JTAG - but it would work.

====================================
Step #1 - Look at this Xilinx app note about programing SPI flash chips 
on the PCB.

<A HREF="http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/application_notes/xapp951.pdf">http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/application_notes/xapp951.pdf</A>

See the schematic on page 4, see note #(3) &quot;PROG_B&quot; should be held LOW 
during the direct programing of the SPI lash.
In effect, that holds the XILINX in RESET - we could do the same - with 
either RESET or TRST.

====================================
Step #2 - You probably need &quot;flying leads&quot; to do this

<A HREF="http://toolbox.xilinx.com/docsan/xilinx5/data/docs/pac/pac0020_6.html">http://toolbox.xilinx.com/docsan/xilinx5/data/docs/pac/pac0020_6.html</A>

See the bottom portion of the above web page.

====================================

Step 3 - Put the JTAG tap in a funny mode...

Then I believe it is a simple matter of walking the JTAG tap through 
this sequence:

1)   make Reset=SPI-CS=high.
2)   Goto state: Shift DR - but do not shift yet.
3)   Reset=SPI-CS=Low
4)   Now shift data in Shift DR state.
        TDI =&gt; data to the spi flash.
       TDO =&gt; data from the spi flash.
5)    Repeat #4 until data is complete
6)   make Reset=SPI-CS=high.
7)   Return to jtag state Test Logic Reset.

====================================
All it will take is somebody with the time to fiddle with it and make it 
happen.

And - we have a GENERIC SPI flash programmer  :-)
