</I>&gt;<i> templates as part of its input, in order to be something general.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Things in a trunk/tools directory wouldn't be required to be generic  
to every target, interface, etc.  The idea is to have a location where  
tools that are useful for maintainers and developers can be located  
away from the source used by everyone else.  If speed_table.c and the  
DTC headers do not change frequently, then it is completely reasonable  
to check in both the source files and the generated files into jtag/ 
rlink directory but still put the tools in trunk/tools so that should  
the source files need to be changed, the generated files can be  
generated without tracking down extra software.

&gt;<i> Or would there then be trunk/tools/{toolname} for common ones and
</I>&gt;<i> trunk/tools/jtag/{interfacename}/{toolname} for ones specific to an
</I>&gt;<i> interface, etc.?
</I>
There could be, but I don't see a reason to.  If the tools are  
reasonably named, there would be no overlap and only developers of  
OpenOCD would be expected to use these tools.

&gt;<i> Would there have to be a
</I>&gt;<i> separate bin directory for tools to prevent naming conflicts between
</I>&gt;<i> executables with no filename suffix and the directories that contain
</I>&gt;<i> their source when they are more complex than one .c and one .h file,  
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> which you allude below?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The tools would not be installed during a 'make install'.  They  
shouldn't even be built during a 'make'.  The idea is to have the  
tools available in the source tree for developer use, but not to use  
them for typical user compilations and installations.  If a developers  
needs a tool, a simple 'make' in the tool directory should build the  
tool.

&gt;<i> In such a scheme, I'd hope there is a way to _build_ such tools when
</I>&gt;<i> they're going to be needed by a given configuration (only the rlink
</I>&gt;<i> interface would need to build a DTC compiler, for example, though,
</I>&gt;<i> persuant to above thinking, more than one conceivably could, but,  
</I>&gt;<i> still,
</I>&gt;<i> most wouldn't).
</I>
Right, the intent is to avoid building the tools at all unless a  
developer needs the tool and builds it manually.  A typical user  
compilation would never touch anything in the tools folder.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Am in compliance with that general rule?  I happened to arrive at the
</I>&gt;<i> scheme I used without knowing about the rule, but it is what made  
</I>&gt;<i> sense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It appears that there are a number of files associated with the rlink  
interface (speed_table.c, rlink.c, rlink.h, dtc_something.h) so  
putting them in a separate directory is appropriate.  Right now, you  
have many of the files in a separate directory but have rlink.c in the  
top-level jtag folder.  Moving all the source files into the rlink  
folder is probably the right move.


&gt;<i> Are the general rules codified anywhere?
</I>
This particular &quot;rule&quot; isn't really an OpenOCD rule.  It is a  
convention used by many many projects that I personally prefer to  
follow.  It keeps the directory structure clean and easy to navigate.   
It also helps indicate which files apply to what interface.  If the  
rest of the OpenOCD developers have no objections, it could be  
formalized.

&gt;<i>  I had to google to find the
</I>&gt;<i> coding standard, and that was nothing current, just a thread saying  
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> one had once been mentioned in a README (or something similar), but no
</I>&gt;<i> longer is, but would be in the future (but isn't, almost a year  
</I>&gt;<i> later).
</I>&gt;<i> It would be a lot easier for somebody (particularly a new somebody,  
</I>&gt;<i> such
</I>&gt;<i> as myself) to comply with such rules if we know what they are.  It  
</I>&gt;<i> could
</I>&gt;<i> prevent several conversations such as this one, or at least reduce  
</I>&gt;<i> them
</I>&gt;<i> to &quot;read the document named {whatever it is called} at {URL or  
</I>&gt;<i> location
</I>&gt;<i> in source tree or either}&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
There was something about this on the list a few days ago.  The old  
README included a brief note on coding style and naming conventions.   
I've copied it here for your reference:

5. Coding Style

The following rules try to describe formatting and naming conventions  
that
should be followed to make the whole OpenOCD code look more consistent.
The ultimate goal of coding style should be readability, and these  
rules may

be ignored for a particular (small) piece of code if that makes it more
readable.

Formatting rules:
- remove any trailing white space
- use TAB characters for indentation, not spaces
- displayed TAB width is 4 characters
- make sure NOT to use DOS '\r\n' line feeds
- do not add more than 2 empty lines to source files
- do not add trailing empty lines to source files
- do not use C++ style comments (//)
- lines may be reasonably wide - there's no anachronistic 80 characters
limit

Naming rules:
- identifiers use lower-case letters only
- identifiers consisting of multiple words use underline characters  
between
consecutive words
- macros use upper-case letters only
- structure names shall be appended with '_s'
- typedefs shall be appended with '_t'

Function calls:
- function calls have no space between the functions name and the  
parameter
list: my_func(param1, param2, ...)

it with him.&quot;
