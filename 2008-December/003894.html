It looks like it contains the build environment for the zy1000  
firmware which _uses_ OpenOCD but isn't part of OpenOCD.

&gt;<i> It is also an embedded version of openocd, so it is built very

Exactly, it isn't part of OpenOCD, but rather a user of OpenOCD.  Just  
because OpenOCD does a release doesn't mean that the zy1000 build  
environment needs to be changed.  For example, OpenOCD might release  
1.0.1 that contains a big bug that makes the zy1000 non-functional.   
It is completely reasonable in that case for the zy1000 build scripts  
to use OpenOCD 1.0 instead with no real impact.

The ZY1000 is a commercial product built on top of OpenOCD.  The  
scripts and files necessary to build the ZY1000 firmware are not part  
of OpenOCD.  They are part of the ZY1000 software.  OpenOCD is simply  
a component of the ZY1000 software.
