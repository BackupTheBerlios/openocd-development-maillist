Ironically, my day job has been exclusively on non-x86 platforms for  
years and only recently started with x86.

Pointers to data types should be aligned such that the data type is  
naturally aligned.  That would mean that a 16-bit type should be 16- 
bit aligned.  The question was related to structures.  Since they are  
not a native data type, I wasn't sure that they required word  
alignment.  I'll dig up my copy of the C standard and check.

In practice, most malloc() implementations return word-alignment at a  
minimum.  This command queue allocation does not do any alignment  
today.  So, the first item allocated in a command queue page will be  
malloc() aligned, but subsequent allocations are not guaranteed to be.

A few approaches can be taken to resolve this.  One is to pad the  
allocations to a word-sized quantity.  Another is to align the start  
of an allocation but not adjust the size used.  Yet another is to have  
separate aligned and unaligned allocators.  Yet another is to allow  
the required alignment to be specified.

To keep with malloc() semantics, guaranteeing that the allocations are  
at least word aligned is probably a good idea.  That allows the  
pointer to be used for any types (except vector types) and requires  
minimal change in the code base.  Padding the allocation size is  
arguably smaller in terms of code, but if that route is used, a  
detailed comment should proceed it explaining why the size is being  
padded.  It should also be done as a modification of the used member  
of the page structure rather than as part of the requested size.  That  
way it is clear that the size of the object allocated isn't changed,  
but that padding was added to force alignment.

it with him.&quot;
