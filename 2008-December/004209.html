</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The question to ask yourself is &quot;Is the distinction merely an

</I>&gt;<i> or a zipdir.  So, why are we forcing them to  tell us?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am also quite concerned about cryptic messages when users do not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ./configure correctly. In my view - the name &quot;-win32-&quot; or &quot;-linux-&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should sort of blink like neon lights in their face that the option  only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> applies to a specific platform.  (maybe i am overly hopeful somebody
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will actually figure that out it)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The cryptic messages aren't going to go away and the configure options  
</I>&gt;<i> aren't going to make it any clearer.  The end result is either going  to 
</I>&gt;<i> be a link error when trying to find libd2xx.so or a run-time error  
</I>&gt;<i> trying to find libd2xx.so.  In both cases, it will be clear that it is  
</I>&gt;<i> due to libd2xx.so not being found. To the user, if --with-d2xx was  
</I>&gt;<i> passed and configure finished successfully, it isn't their fault.   
</I>&gt;<i> Configure is intended to catch these types of problems early.  We could:
</I>&gt;<i> - Check the provided path for known layouts (installed, tardir, zipdir)
</I>&gt;<i> - Check that the binary is for the correct platform (compile a simple  
</I>&gt;<i> program)
</I>&gt;<i> - Check that the binary can be found at runtime (run the compiled  
</I>&gt;<i> simple program)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If any of those 3 fail during configure, we can spew an error then  that 
</I>&gt;<i> clearly indicates the problem.  That removes the need for all the  
</I>&gt;<i> different options to configure but still helps the user.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All of this is in contrast to &quot;libftdi&quot; - which - if the &quot;--prefix&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and/or &quot;--exec-prefix&quot; is non-standard... ie: like you and I do  things -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on linux I need to add &quot;-rpath&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Not sure about Win32.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

I'm not sure I still can completely follow all details here ;) But 
Rick's point of view sounds quite reasonable to me.

Short conclusion from my (limited Linux only) point of view. I think 
for my use cases everything would already be fine

* if for (open source) libftdi path given by --prefix is used by -I 
and -L, too.

* if for (binary) ftd2xx path given by (existing) -with-ftd2xx is 
additonally used by -L

Maybe we can start with these two fixes which are improvements 
already? And then go on with further changes (e.g. introducing 
--with-ftd2xx-win32-zipdir and --with-ftd2xx-linux-tardir ) later in a 
second step on top of this?

Best regards

Dirk
