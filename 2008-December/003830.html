There is never a good time to make a branch.  That's why you choose  
tools that allow easy merging between branches and the trunk.  I  
wouldn't say that the 1.0 branch was cut too early.  It isn't entirely  
clear that all of the changes committed to trunk should be pulled back  
into the branch.  Once a branch is cut, each commit to trunk should be  
evaluated for the branch.  The evaluation should consider risk vs  
reward and only merge in changes that have high reward for the risk  
(i.e. if the risk is low and the reward is low, it's ok.  If the risk  
is medium and the reward is high, it's ok.  If the risk is high but  
the reward is medium, don't take it).  That way things that improve  
the quality without introducing instability are merged into the  
branch.  That methodology advocates cutting a stable branch relatively  
early to avoid destabilizing changes from making it into the release.
