</I>&gt;<i> Ok.  I will proceed thusly, as it appears such a scheme is being

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Agreed.  This should be done before our 1.0 release.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When is that?  I get the idea, alternately, that it is soon, and

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

The hope was to release 1.0 in a month or two.  I'm trying to limit  
the number of new features that are being introduced into 1.0 to avoid  
moving the release out.  I plan to bring the 1.0 branch in sync with  
trunk in the next few days and build a beta source tarball for people  
to test with.

&quot;He said he hadn't had a byte in three days. I had a short, so I split  
it with him.&quot;
