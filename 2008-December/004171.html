Yes.

I'm not sure but it seems to me that below you concentrate on 
&quot;libftd2xx on the various OSs&quot;? In the rev 1.0 thread I started the 
discussion with &quot;libftd2xx vs. libftdi at Linux&quot; in mind. So same 
problem, but slightly different focus ;) Did I miss it or didn't you 
mention libftdi below?

&gt;<i> The question I have is this:  What should the option be pointing at?
</I>
Will try to give my $0.02 below.

&gt;<i> Details and commentary follow.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -Duane.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ==================================================
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For all systems
</I>&gt;<i>     There is the question of where is the &quot;H&quot; file?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i>     There is the question of where is the LIB
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i>     And is it a STATIC or SHARED library?
</I>
I would focus on shared library. People who want static know what they do?

&gt;<i> ==================================================
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For cygwin - what would one expect?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     There is *NO* standardized &quot;how to install it&quot; set of instructions
</I>&gt;<i>     telling the *victim* what to do.  maybe there is - but I cannot
</I>&gt;<i>     find it and do not know where to look.
</I>&gt;<i>     So we must set our own expectations and tell the user what to do.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     What I do is this:
</I>&gt;<i>        I unzip the ZIP file - next to openocd.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Hence, I have (under cygwin)
</I>&gt;<i>        /home/duane/work/openocd.VERSION/....
</I>&gt;<i>        /home/duane/work/ftd2xx.d
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    I would like an option that says:
</I>&gt;<i>          &quot;this is the directory where I unzipped the ZIP file&quot;
</I>
Yes. This sounds good. The directory where ZIP file is unzipped 
contains LIB and H, so this should be fine to be added to -I and -L.

&gt;<i>     What do you do?
</I>&gt;<i>     What is expected?
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;<i>     The problem lies with 'ftdi' they did not state what is &quot;proper&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>     so everyone does it differently.
</I>
I think people unzip and pass the path to OpenOCD is the easiest way 
and we should take it.

&gt;<i> ==================================================
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For MingWin - I don't know. I do not use MingWin.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Spen? Do you hav a comment?
</I>&gt;<i>     Do others?
</I>&gt;<i>     Input would be appreciated.
</I>
Don't know, too.

&gt;<i> ==================================================
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For Linux - it is entirely 50% not 100% a different matter, FTDI set a
</I>&gt;<i> standard, they have a  readme file. But - that &quot;readme.dat&quot; file is 
</I>&gt;<i> incomplete.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Functionally, it tells the *victim* how to install the &quot;.so&quot; file and 
</I>&gt;<i> setup the
</I>&gt;<i> standardized version numbered sym-link in two places.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     (1) /usr/lib
</I>&gt;<i>     and (2) /usr/local/lib
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The readme file does not speak about &quot;ftdi2xx.h&quot; - so one is left to wonder
</I>&gt;<i> where it is put. I suspect - it is in a *RANDOM* place - or not even
</I>&gt;<i> installed anywhere.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What should we do?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Option #1 - is - we assume the user has followed the instructions and 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;installed the .
</I>&gt;<i> so file&quot; and nothing else.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     This leaves the need to have a --config-option to point where the 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;.h&quot; file
</I>&gt;<i>     can be found.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Option #2 - is we assume did not install it -
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;<i>     Should we expect the &quot;--config-option&quot; to point at the directory 
</I>&gt;<i> where they
</I>&gt;<i>     exploaded the tar ball.
</I>
As I understand it, from practical point of view there is no 
difference between option #1 and option #2.

The directory where the tar ball is extracted to contains .so and .h 
file. So option #2 should always work adding the path to tar directory 
to -I and -L. If they copied (moved?) .so to installed directory 
(option #1) (e.g. /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib) this would be in library 
search path and the additional -L path at link time wouldn't hurt.

&gt;<i> Option #3 - Same as Option #2.
</I>&gt;<i>      But instead of linking with the &quot;.so&quot; file - we link with the 
</I>&gt;<i> static lib.
</I>
As mentioned above, I wouldn't care about static library.

&gt;<i> ==================================================
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  From a design point of view I am faced with a dilemma.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is no defined way one would expect it the package to be installed :-(
</I>&gt;<i> So - what ever we do - we will force something on the user.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Basically we tell the user Do X/Y/Z - and it will work, do something 
</I>&gt;<i> else and it will not.
</I>&gt;<i> or we end up with configure option-hell.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ==================================================
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest we do the following:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Remove:     --with-ftd2xx
</I>
Yes, or rename it ;)

&gt;<i> Based on &quot;--enable-ftd2xx_libftdi&quot; - we look for the H and LIB files
</I>&gt;<i> we look in _the_standard_places_  ie:
</I>&gt;<i>     /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, and /usr/include,and /usr/local/include
</I>
Yes. This is the default already?

&gt;<i> And then demand/complain if the following items where not set.
</I>&gt;<i> These options will be used to resolve the problems - if needed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (1) Add:         --with-ftd2xx-libdir=&lt;PATH&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>      It becomes yet another &quot;-I&quot; paths.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (2) Add:         --with-ftd2xx-incdir=&lt;PATH&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     It becomes yet another &quot;-L&quot; and &quot;-rpath&quot; options
</I>&gt;<i>     (because it might be a 'shared library' in a non-standard place)
</I>
Did you mix libdir and incdir in (1) and (2) ?

I don't like (1) and (2) and would vote for (3) and (4) below:

&gt;<i> (3) Add:          --with-ftd2xx-zipdir=&lt;PATH&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>        Assumes you did not install it - just unzipped it
</I>&gt;<i>        Under cygwin, you downloaded the ZIP file
</I>&gt;<i>        And this is the directory where you unzipped it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (4)  Add:         --with-libftd2xx-tardir=&lt;PATH&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>          Assumes you did not install it, just unzipped it.
</I>&gt;<i>          Same as (3) but for Linux/Unix
</I>&gt;<i>          We would default to the *static* version.
</I>
Why static? Why different names for the same functionality?

Why not just

--with-libftd2xx-dir

for the directory where .tar or .zip are extracted to and where .so 
and .h files are located? Add path given by 
--with-libftd2xx-dir=&lt;PATH&gt; to -L and -I and everything should be fine 
for libftd2xx?

But, as mentioned above, it seems to me that libftdi isn't discussed 
here? I don't know the details as good as you, but what's about:

Replace/rename --with-ftd2xx to e.g. --with-ft2232-dir then do

* If --enable-ft2232_ftd2xx is enabled using --with-ft2232-dir=&lt;PATH&gt; 
results in

-I&lt;PATH&gt;
-L&lt;PATH&gt;

where PATH is a path to tar/zip directory

* If --enable-ft2232_libftdi is enabled using --with-ft2232-dir=&lt;PATH&gt; 
results in

-I&lt;PATH&gt;/include
-L&lt;PATH&gt;/lib

where PATH is a path to the libftdi (--prefix) main install directory.

In both cases, if people already moved .so/.h to some standard 
directories which are in include/link search path, this wouldn't hurt.

Would this work?

&gt;<i> (5) MingWin - And I am not sure about MingW32 situation.
</I>&gt;<i>       I believe one of the above might handle the situation.
</I>&gt;<i>       Can somebody offer a comment ( ? Spen ? )
</I>
Don't know.

&gt;<i> Problems:
</I>&gt;<i>       Dealing with &quot;i386&quot; vrs &quot;x86_64&quot; subdirectories
</I>&gt;<i>      I'm looking for an autoconf reference if there is a standard way or 
</I>&gt;<i> not.
</I>&gt;<i>       If somebody knows this already - a reference would be helpful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ==================================================
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> TEST -
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I cannot test all combinations - help will be appreciated.
</I>
I would be happy to test libftdi and libftd2xx under Linux.

Best regards

Dirk
