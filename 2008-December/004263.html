<PRE>Dirk Behme a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Running it as root does the trick. chmod a+s didn't help.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wonder why open source libftdi is able to do the job, but libftd2xx 
</I>&gt;<i> needs to do some root stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, thanks
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dirk

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>If you want to do chmod a+s openocd you have to do it from root

sudo chmod /usr/bin/openocd

It works here. Some people have strong opinion against that for security 
reasons. I don't think that running as root is any better.
I could not get libftdi to work correctly with my STM32 board, not to 
say that there aren't any issues with the STM32 support.

It is sorta acceptable with Olimex Tiny JTAG but dog slow with jlink. I 
test on an STM32-SK board that I got at some contest.
It is made for IAR and comes with the latest yellow jlink from IAR.

It takes about 13 seconds to flash a program of about 55k with Olimex 
and 53 seconds or more with jlink. It is close to twice that from within
eclipse.  Jlink stays in a drawer for the time being since it is 
basically useless. I don't have time to check the support for it yet as 
I am busy getting my
development on Fedora 9 working.
