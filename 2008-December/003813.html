<PRE>Hi Ronald,

FYI: A while ago I tried to chain watchpoints together, but failed. This is useful when debugging multi-threaded code. See:

<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2008-May/002193.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2008-May/002193.html</A>

Best regards,
Pieter

Subject: [Openocd-development] OpenOCD Thread Support

Hi,

I've just started using OpenOCD on a Cortex-M3 platform and am looking
into thread support for RTOS's.

I've seen &#216;yvind Harboe's post of 5 Nov titled &quot;Support for eCos threads
in OpenOCD&quot;, but didn't see much replies. So I'm trying again, hoping
there are more people on this list that would like to see thread support
in OpenOCD. I am personally not aiming for eCos, but I think there are
quite a few common parts to thread support that can be useful for me or
where I can provide support to the development.

Does anyone have experience with adding thread support to a gdb stub?
I've looked into the gdbserver code that gives quite a few good
pointers, but any help is welcome.

Thanks,

Ronald Vanschoren
