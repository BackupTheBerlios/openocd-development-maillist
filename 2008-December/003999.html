Fair enough.  For something like the at91rm9200, at the tap level,  
both the debug and boundary scan mode IDs are valid, but at a target  
level, only debug is useful.

&gt;<i> Adding *ANOTHER* *ADDITIONAL*  mechanism - for *TAP* events - yes,  
</I>&gt;<i> that is possible.
</I>&gt;<i> But - that gets messy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
As my other patch shows, such a mechanism simplifies interacting with  
a JTAG route controller, so the mechanism would already be in place.

&gt;<i> Please recall our earlier discussion about &quot;taps as objects&quot; we came  
</I>&gt;<i> to the conclusion that &quot;taps as objects&quot; was not a good idea,m the  
</I>&gt;<i> problem was namespace issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I still believe namespaces a big problem.  That said, having separate  
namespaces doesn't preclude &quot;taps as objects&quot;.  From a programmatic  
view, target objects could be contained under a &quot;targets&quot; global and  
tap objects could be contained under a &quot;taps&quot; global.  That handles  
the namespace problem but allows both to be treated as objects.

Doing this should also make adding other protocols like SWJ, I2C, and  
SPI easier.  The tap objects can be a generic struct that contains a  
type identifier.  This type would indicate which protocol it uses and  
also indicates the other members of the struct.  Then, each protocol  
would have a top-level command similar to the &quot;jtag&quot; command.  That  
command would have a &quot;newtap&quot; subcommand that takes the appropriate  
operands for that protocol.  Then when creating a target, the tap is  
specified.  The target could inspect the tap to determine if it can  
use a tap of that type.  That would provide sufficient decoupling  
between the protocols and the targets to allow new protocols to be  
introduced with relative ease.

&gt;<i> ==============
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Rick&gt; The id is tied to a tap which may or may not be a target.  If  
</I>&gt;<i> we tie it to a target event, how would you do an id check for a PLD?
</I>&gt;<i> Via the list of  &quot;-expected-id&quot; patch that you just posted to the  
</I>&gt;<i> list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That would only prove that one of the expected IDs was matched during  
chain examination.  Ostensibly, a PLD could have 2 JTAG modes that  
change the ID it reports similar to the at91rm9200.  Thus, the target  
tap-validate event would need to be replicated for PLDs, NAND, etc to  
allow those types to report additional information such as &quot;Pin 5 is  
grounded which places the PLD is run-only mode.  To program the PLD,  
connect pin 5 to Vcc.&quot;
