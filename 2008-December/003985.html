Let me back up a few steps here.

There is a *SIMPLE* way to do this in TCL - it requires a couple 
*SIMPLE* things be done.
{See below}

=================================

The original purpose of the &quot;-expected-id&quot; was to print a big-nasty 
warning if the TAP id did not match.

Why did I add this? Because there was a *SLEW* of people trying to 
figure out how to setup the taps and new boards and stuff.
We release new versions of OpenOCD - people try something - blah blah 
blah - there is no standardized config script schema or and method.

This was a message to make the user go &quot;OOH  THAT  DOES NOT LOOK RIGHT&quot; 
- perhaps that is my problem!

Hence, if the expected id is ZERO - nothing happens.

=================================

Perhaps:   &quot;-expected-id&quot; was a bad choice of names.

Maybe,  &quot;-one-possible-valid-id&quot; would have been better a choice.

For example - today - the code does *NOT* ignore Tap VERSION numbers 
(the high nibble).

And that is problematic - the AT91RM9200 - has tapid version 0 for the 
&quot;arm debug config&quot;
and tap version number 1 - for the &quot;boundary scan mode&quot;.

So - obviously masking and ignoring the TAP VERSION is not going to help.

We specifically almost need a &quot;-disallow-this-tap-id&quot; in some cases :-( 
boo hiss boo hiss.

=================================

I think the idea of supporting *MULTIPLE*  &quot;-expected-id&quot; parameters is 
a good thing.
(ie: an array of tap ids in the C code).  It is a *SMALL* and reasonable 
price to pay.

==================================

Here is the *SIMPLE* thing that needs to happen.

(1) There needs to be a new target event.
       This event should happen when all taps have been &quot;re-id&quot; aka: 
when the chain is validated.
       Adding an event is really super easy.

      target.h - there is an enum to add to
      target.c - there is a Jim_Nvp to add to.

(2) At the end of the function:  jtag_examine_chain() - you need to call 
this function:

             target_all_handle_event(   YOUR_NEW_EVENT_ENUM );

(3)  Lastly - there needs to be a single new TCL sub command.

     We need a command that works like this:
          Given a TAPNAME - what is the TAPID that was discovered?
      For example:

               set foo [jtag tapidof   MYTAPNAME]
               puts [format &quot;The tap id is: 0x%08x&quot;  $foo]

     To add the above see: &quot;jtag.c&quot; - function: 'jim_jtag_command()&quot;

      There is a table of sub commands.
      There is a enumeration of commands.
      And a switch statement to add the command into.
      And an example is the &quot;JTAG_CMD_ISENABLED&quot;
      Instead of returning 0/1 - you return the TAP ID.

================================================

Then, one could easily do this:
[which has a bug in it...but is easy to fix. keep reading...

 $_TARGETNAME  configure --event   jtag-verify-tapid    {
   
     set tapname [$_TARGETNAME  cget -chain-position]

     # WHAT IS MISSING IS THIS COMMAND
     # it takes the TAPNAME - and returns the TAPID.
     set cur_tapid  [ jtag tapidof $tapname ]

      if  {  $cur_tapid == 0x12345678 } {
                # GOOD TAP
                return;
      }
      if { $cur_tapid == 0x87654321 } {
                puts &quot;**WARNING** THIS I NOT THE CHIP YOU ARE LOOKING FOR&quot;
                puts &quot;You have the jumper configured wrong it will not 
work in this config&quot;
                return;
      }

      puts [format &quot;Unknown tap id 0x%08x - Maybe you have a new chip?&quot; 
$cur_tapid]
      return;
}

So - what is the bug? In the above, in the eventbody ... it uses 
&quot;$_TARGETNAME&quot; as the target name,
See: section 22.6.3 - BODY OR INLINE TEXT , item #1 in the description.
A 'hazard' one must be able to work around.
On a single target system - you will never find hit  bug.
On a MULTIPLE GDB TARGET system - you would find this bug.

===================

Patches are welcome!

-Duane.
