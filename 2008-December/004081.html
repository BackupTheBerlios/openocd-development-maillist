<PRE>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Attached, is a patch against the svn trunk that adds support 
</I>&gt;<i> for the Raisonance RLink JTAG adapter.  That adapter is 
</I>&gt;<i> mostly used with their RIDE software, but there is a version 
</I>&gt;<i> of it embedded in the STM32 Primer (a development board), 
</I>&gt;<i> where it is wired in in lieu of a JTAG connector.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some reverse engineering was needed.  USB traffic sniffing, 
</I>&gt;<i> analyzing publicly downloadable sample projects, and the 
</I>&gt;<i> like.  Hopefully, that falls into the category of &quot;not a 
</I>&gt;<i> problem&quot;.  Neither I, nor the other person I've been working 
</I>&gt;<i> with, have entered into any sort of NDA which relates to 
</I>&gt;<i> this.  I'm bringing this up now in case there is an issue.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The basic architecture of the R-Link adapter is an ST7 
</I>&gt;<i> microcontroller with a USB device interface and a Data 
</I>&gt;<i> Transfer Coprocessor in it.
</I>&gt;<i> This driver communicates with the firmware on that 
</I>&gt;<i> microcontroller and uses it to load an image into the DTC and 
</I>&gt;<i> runs that to bit-bang each of several speeds.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If it needs tweaking to make it suitable for inclusion, we'll do it.
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to work fine in basic testing on our Linux systems.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
It would be good to include the rlink (i have a few lying around) but am
unsure we could without
permission from Raisonance. It is a closed interface so am unsure of the
legal implications - is there any?

Segger released the api for the jlink - however it is not available on their
website anymore.

Cheers
Spen
