</I>Structures require the alignment of the largest type that is inside -
ie. a structure that contains only chars does not need any alignment, a
struct that containt integers requires integer alignment etc..

&gt;<i> In practice, most malloc() implementations return word-alignment at a

</I>&gt;<i> today.  So, the first item allocated in a command queue page will be
</I>&gt;<i> malloc() aligned, but subsequent allocations are not guaranteed to be.
</I>Malloc needs to align to the largest machine type - that may be word (if
&quot;word&quot; is a machine word, not a 16-bit value).

&gt;<i> A few approaches can be taken to resolve this.  One is to pad the
</I>&gt;<i> allocations to a word-sized quantity.  Another is to align the start
</I>&gt;<i> of an allocation but not adjust the size used.  Yet another is to have
</I>&gt;<i> separate aligned and unaligned allocators.  Yet another is to allow
</I>&gt;<i> the required alignment to be specified.
</I>Unless there are really compelling reasons why someone would need
unaligned allocation, I think always aligning like malloc does is the
best way.

&gt;<i> To keep with malloc() semantics, guaranteeing that the allocations are
</I>&gt;<i> at least word aligned is probably a good idea.  That allows the
</I>&gt;<i> pointer to be used for any types (except vector types) and requires
</I>&gt;<i> minimal change in the code base.  Padding the allocation size is
</I>&gt;<i> arguably smaller in terms of code, but if that route is used, a
</I>&gt;<i> detailed comment should proceed it explaining why the size is being
</I>&gt;<i> padded.  It should also be done as a modification of the used member
</I>&gt;<i> of the page structure rather than as part of the requested size.  That
</I>&gt;<i> way it is clear that the size of the object allocated isn't changed,
</I>&gt;<i> but that padding was added to force alignment.
</I>Agreed. Both are fine IMHO - the chosen method depends a bit on taste.
