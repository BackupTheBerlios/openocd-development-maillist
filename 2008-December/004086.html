If you include speed_table.pl to build the speed_table.c file, should  
the table be rebuilt during the build process rather than having it be  
part of the source base?  It seems redundant to include both.

Can the patch and ${PATCHFILE} targets in the Makefile be dropped?   
They seem to be part of your development process.

Since you made a new directory for the rlink files, could rlink.c be  
moved in there and the jtag directory's Makefile adjusted to build the  
rlink directory as a static archive that the jtag.a links against.   
The other approach would be to move all of the rlink files into the  
jtag folder.

speed_table.c is #included.  Either speed_table.c should be  
speed_table.h or speed_table.c should be compiled separately and  
linked in.

it with him.&quot;
