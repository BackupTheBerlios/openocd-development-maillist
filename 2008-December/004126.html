</I>&gt;<i> huge
</I>&gt;<i> deal to make the necessary modifications to the parts affected by my
</I>&gt;<i> patch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Being the organizational neat freak that I am, I would prefer if you  
went ahead and put the rlink tools in trunk/tools.  I'll locate any  
others that are already in the source base and move them.  Having  
_something_ in trunk/tools will mean that future tools would have a  
defined location and we would request that the patch author place them  
there.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Am in compliance with that general rule?  I happened to arrive at  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> scheme I used without knowing about the rule, but it is what made
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sense.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It appears that there are a number of files associated with the rlink
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interface (speed_table.c, rlink.c, rlink.h, dtc_something.h) so  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> putting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them in a separate directory is appropriate.  Right now, you have  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> many of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the files in a separate directory but have rlink.c in the top-level  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> jtag
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> folder.  Moving all the source files into the rlink folder is  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> probably
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the right move.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've moved it in there, but the .o file still gets built in the src/ 
</I>&gt;<i> jtag
</I>&gt;<i> directory.  I assume that is consistent with what you're saying.
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise, automake seems to be working against us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That works for now.  There are ways to make automake build the rlink  
directory separately, but that isn't so much of a concern as  
separating the source files.

&gt;<i> I don't know what that gains us, but it is done.  Leaving rlink.c out
</I>&gt;<i> there with the others seemed to make more sense to me.  Especially  
</I>&gt;<i> since
</I>&gt;<i> I now know that the .o file ends up there anyway.  But I have moved it
</I>&gt;<i> into the directory pursuant to your suggestion.  Moving it back  
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> be a huge deal.  Just a &quot;svn mv&quot; and an edit to Makefile.am.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It means that all of the rlink files are in one place so it is easier  
to determine what all is used by rlink and only rlink.

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Are the general rules codified anywhere?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This particular &quot;rule&quot; isn't really an OpenOCD rule.  It is a  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> convention
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> used by many many projects that I personally prefer to follow.  It  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> keeps
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the directory structure clean and easy to navigate.  It also helps
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> indicate which files apply to what interface.  If the rest of the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenOCD
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> developers have no objections, it could be formalized.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be helpful, particularly to new people, to have a document  
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> enumerates how things are laid out and how people are expected to do
</I>&gt;<i> things.  Particularly for situations such as mine where there are no
</I>&gt;<i> existing examples, yet, from which to crib.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agreed.  This should be done before our 1.0 release.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I had to google to find the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> coding standard, and that was nothing current, just a thread saying
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> one had once been mentioned in a README (or something similar),  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> but no
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> longer is, but would be in the future (but isn't, almost a year
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> later).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It would be a lot easier for somebody (particularly a new somebody,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> such
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> as myself) to comply with such rules if we know what they are.  It
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> could
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> prevent several conversations such as this one, or at least reduce
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> them
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to &quot;read the document named {whatever it is called} at {URL or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> location
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in source tree or either}&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There was something about this on the list a few days ago.  The old
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> README included a brief note on coding style and naming conventions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's how I knew to look up the earlier part of the thread.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've copied it here for your reference:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yup.  That's what I was referring to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This point was really about my experience with trying to find out how
</I>&gt;<i> the community wanted ceratin things done.  It was merely a specific
</I>&gt;<i> example.

&quot;He said he hadn't had a byte in three days. I had a short, so I split  
it with him.&quot;
