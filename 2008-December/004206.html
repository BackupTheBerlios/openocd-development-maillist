Yes.


Also:

The queuing of commands is awkwardly done.   UrJTAG is reworking the API 
at this time also, but their starting point is far cleaner than 
OpenOCD's.    So even with a better cable driver API, they are not 
content.  


I suggest working in proposal form rather than in code modification 
mode, and share that proposal document with UrJTAG and see if a 
consensus can be reached.    Then the drivers can be shared at that 
point between the two projects.   A simple *.h file that has doxygen 
compatible comments would be a fine document to embody a proposed new 
cable driver API.


See this document:

<A HREF="http://www.abatron.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/products/pdf/bdiacc.pdf">http://www.abatron.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/products/pdf/bdiacc.pdf</A>

All we need is functionality similar to BDI_DoJtag() in the PDF above.  
If there was a driver API like that, then the other stuff can be written 
on top of that, in any language.   I would personally be doing a swig 
layer to *in process* Python ASAP if there was a cable driver API worth 
its salt.


The cable driver API in OpenOCD is atrocious.
