There is no real reason though.  It is an unnecessary code change for  
no benefit.  Any of the complex cases would need to have -expected-id  
removed from their jtag newtap command.  We would need to explain that  
the &quot;id&quot; event is called when the target ID is read and that it _must_  
be implemented.  Just adding jtag match/nomatch events and allowing - 
expected-id to be specified multiple times solves all foreseeable  
problems.

</I>
But the TCL handler _doesn't need to_ do everything C can do.  The  
_only_ thing C will be able to do is compare the captured ID against a  
set of expected ids and call a match/nomatch event.  The scripts  
become a lot more straightforward since they are divided into the 2  
main cases, matched something we expected or didn't,  instead of  
having one big event that always has a top-level if to distinguish the  
cases.

The match/nomatch events allow the target script to do whatever they  
need to do depending on if the captured ID is expected or not.  We  
just make it simpler so that the target script doesn't need to encode  
lots of &quot;if ID is X, then&quot; logic.  We could even make the match events  
dynamic based on the expected IDs provided.  So, a command such as:

jtag newtap $_CHIPNAME cpu -irlen 5 -ircapture 0x1 -irmask 0x1f - 
expected-id $_CPUTAPID -expected-id $_OTHERCPUTAPID

would create a tap with 3 events available: matched-id-$_CPUTAPID,  
matched-id-$_OTHERCPUTAPID, and nomatch.  Then the target scripts can  
be focused on whatever needs to be done when a given ID is captured  
rather than having to figure out which ID it is.  Simple scripts could  
be used with no changes. Complex scripts can be easily written without  
a lot of boilerplate code and allow the script author to do anything  
necessary. The code path would be the event mechanism and I'm certain  
TCL can do &quot;if-then-else&quot; constructs so concerns about not providing  
capability to target scripts are unfounded.

&gt;<i> btw, I think the best way is to &quot;return -error&quot; to throw an  
</I>&gt;<i> exception and leave
</I>&gt;<i> the primary return value alone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
My knowledge of TCL is limited.  The intent was to return a failure  
condition.

it with him.&quot;
