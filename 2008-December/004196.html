If you use configure with --prefix and do a 'make install', the  
resulting binary has the correct install path encoded.  Otherwise, my  
build of libftdi on OS X via MacPorts would break since it build  
libftdi into /opt/local.  It certainly doesn't use rpath for that.  To  
see for yourself, build libftdi with --prefix set to something strange  
like /var/tmp.  After a 'make', run ldd on the binary and it should  
tell you the install path that was encoded.  This is also how I build  
the GNU toolchain into /usr/local/arm without rpath.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Installing to a non-standard location isn't a problem as long as -- 
prefix is used and 'make install' is used to install the bits.  rpath  
comes into play if the encoded install path for the .so is different  
from the actual path on disk.  That only happens if you manually move  
the .so or if you do funny things like 'make install DSTROOT=...'.

&gt;<i> In fact, numerous GNU tools tell you to do exactly this. MPFR and  
</I>&gt;<i> GMP are two exact examples of this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> See for example the MPFR manual, section 4.1 - here: <A HREF="http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/mpfr.html">http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/mpfr.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Last paragraph.

The reference there is pretty light on details.  &quot;on some system&quot; you  
&quot;may&quot; need to use path.  The only cases I can think of are if you  
installed to a location different from the configure --prefix path via  
DSTROOT.  OS X tends to encode the full path in the binary, but if you  
encode _only_ the filename and it is in a non-standard location, you  
would need to use rpath, but that is not a normal case and would  
require additional work to force the encoded path to be only the  
filename.

I suggest trying to build libftdi with --prefix into a location such  
as /opt/local or /var/tmp.  After it is built and installed, a simple  
test program should link and run as long as -L&lt;path&gt; and -lftdi are  
passed.
