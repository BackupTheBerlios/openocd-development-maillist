I am working with a Sigma SMP8634 chip which has a MIPS 4Kce core.

I just have the simple Xilinx DLC5 cable which is basically a one-to-one
connections with 5 resistors.

&gt;<i> &gt; This is due to each memory read/write instruction is fetched from the

I guess DMA is not supported in my case.

&gt;<i> &gt; One question if you have the image in flash, can you not debug from
</I>flash?

Well, at the moment I don't have it in flash, I am currently downloading
it via jtag. The elf image is a executable with a entry point in RAM.
Sure, I can try to change the linker scripts and everything else to run
it out of flash like everybody else does, but using exactly that image
would be very nice. My idea is to tell the load_image command (or any
other command) to not load the entire elf-image via jtag but directly
from a flash address. This should be faster since I don't have to
transfer the bytes via jtag as running a set of mww commands should to
the trick, right?
Is this possible or am I getting something completely wrong?

Best regards,
Andi
