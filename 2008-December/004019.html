Hello,

Please let me introduce myself.  I am an embedded developer of 25 
years.  Software is my thing.

I wrote an SVF to XSVF converter in python and it is at a point where it 
needs testing.   While I am doing that I am improving the diagnostics in 
your xsvf.c.



Questions:

1)  How do you receive patches, simply as an attachment to this list?  
Or is there a better way?



2) What is your editor tabs vs. spaces policy, any style document 
available.  Jedit is what I use, and it is having a damn hard time with 
tabs, which I normally do not use.  Suggestions on a filter to run 
through before sending would be helpful.  Jedit is an outstanding 
editor, but I think most folks use it with spaces.



3) Do you want the SVF to XSVF converter as part of this project, say in 
a separate directory?  I also have an XSVF file dumper to show the 
contents of the XSVF file, also written in python.



4) Under what circumstances would a person get write permission to the 
repository?



5) Why the short names for the &quot;enum tap_state&quot;s?  These are simply 
enums, they don't control the size of the generated code, but as chosen 
they are way too cryptic for most humans.  I would suggest a global edit 
to TAP_&lt;SVF STATE&gt;  where &lt;SVF STATE&gt; is the same spelling as in the SVF 
spec from ASSET InterTech, Inc.   For example TAP_E2D which is 
ridiculously cryptic, would become TAP_DREXIT2.


Thanks in advance,

Dick Hollenbeck
