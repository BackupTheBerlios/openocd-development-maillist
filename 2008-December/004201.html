<PRE>According to the web site the patch was scrubbed off. It must not like my extension .diff so I changed it to .patch and am trying again.

Here is a patch to fix a few bugs. They are minor bugs but got me stalled in my development for a couple days as I was looking at the wrong places
for a solution. There are basically a few typos and a configuration that didn't work for me.

There seem to be a few different Olimex Tiny devices as mine didn't work with the example configuration. I created a different configuration
without the A in the name with the proper information and it now works with my Olimex Device.

I put some example configurations on my website for anyone who is interested.


I could not get my older black j-link devices to work while the newer yellow one works. I am curious as to what the basic difference would be between
the two. I tested them at work and they were working just as good on windows as the yellow one with IAR 5.2. (I don't use windows at home)
