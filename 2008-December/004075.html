<PRE>Attached, is a patch against the svn trunk that adds support for the
Raisonance RLink JTAG adapter.  That adapter is mostly used with their
RIDE software, but there is a version of it embedded in the STM32 Primer
(a development board), where it is wired in in lieu of a JTAG connector.

Some reverse engineering was needed.  USB traffic sniffing, analyzing
publicly downloadable sample projects, and the like.  Hopefully, that
falls into the category of &quot;not a problem&quot;.  Neither I, nor the other
person I've been working with, have entered into any sort of NDA which
relates to this.  I'm bringing this up now in case there is an issue.

The basic architecture of the R-Link adapter is an ST7 microcontroller
with a USB device interface and a Data Transfer Coprocessor in it.
This driver communicates with the firmware on that microcontroller and
uses it to load an image into the DTC and runs that to bit-bang each of
several speeds.

If it needs tweaking to make it suitable for inclusion, we'll do it.
It seems to work fine in basic testing on our Linux systems.
