The whole point of a version control system is to be able to go
back and *build* some older version.

The zy1000 directory contains the prerequisites to build the binary.

embedded is different from building for developer operating systems.



&gt;&gt;<i> It is also an embedded version of openocd, so it is built very differently
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from openocd hosted on a developer OS.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly, it isn't part of OpenOCD, but rather a user of OpenOCD.  Just
</I>&gt;<i> because OpenOCD does a release doesn't mean that the zy1000 build
</I>&gt;<i> environment needs to be changed.  For example, OpenOCD might release 1.0.1
</I>&gt;<i> that contains a big bug that makes the zy1000 non-functional.  It is
</I>&gt;<i> completely reasonable in that case for the zy1000 build scripts to use
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD 1.0 instead with no real impact.
</I>
Note that the zy1000 directory also contains *code* for openocd, not only the
build scripts. All of that code, combined, is GPL and there is no way to
mix and match versions of tools and other code that goes into the final mix.

It is not necessary to complicate the life of most developers out there with
the nasty bits that goes into building an embedded product and a separate
folder solves this.

&gt;<i> The ZY1000 is a commercial product built on top of OpenOCD.  The scripts and
</I>&gt;<i> files necessary to build the ZY1000 firmware are not part of OpenOCD.  They
</I>&gt;<i> are part of the ZY1000 software.  OpenOCD is simply a component of the
</I>&gt;<i> ZY1000 software.
</I>
What are you trying to say here?

OpenOCD is GPL and ZY1000 uses OpenOCD, so the resulting code is GPL.

Where does &quot;commerical&quot; enter into it? GPL does not mean non-commerical.
In fact commercial and non-commerical is equal from GPL's point of view.

What's the problem you're trying to address?

What are you suggesting?
