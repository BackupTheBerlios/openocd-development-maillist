<PRE>A while ago - w.r.t. rev 1.0 - we where talking about the --with-ftd2xx 
option.

The general idea was to add a &quot;path&quot; option of some sort.

The question I have is this:  What should the option be pointing at?

Details and commentary follow.

-Duane.

==================================================

For all systems
    There is the question of where is the &quot;H&quot; file?
    There is the question of where is the LIB
    And is it a STATIC or SHARED library?

==================================================

For cygwin - what would one expect?

    There is *NO* standardized &quot;how to install it&quot; set of instructions
    telling the *victim* what to do.  maybe there is - but I cannot
    find it and do not know where to look.
    So we must set our own expectations and tell the user what to do.

    What I do is this:
       I unzip the ZIP file - next to openocd.

    Hence, I have (under cygwin)
       /home/duane/work/openocd.VERSION/....
       /home/duane/work/ftd2xx.d

   I would like an option that says:
         &quot;this is the directory where I unzipped the ZIP file&quot;
    
    What do you do?
    What is expected?
   
    The problem lies with 'ftdi' they did not state what is &quot;proper&quot;
    so everyone does it differently.

==================================================

For MingWin - I don't know. I do not use MingWin.

    Spen? Do you hav a comment?
    Do others?
    Input would be appreciated.

==================================================

For Linux - it is entirely 50% not 100% a different matter, FTDI set a
standard, they have a  readme file. But - that &quot;readme.dat&quot; file is 
incomplete.

Functionally, it tells the *victim* how to install the &quot;.so&quot; file and 
setup the
standardized version numbered sym-link in two places.

    (1) /usr/lib
    and (2) /usr/local/lib

The readme file does not speak about &quot;ftdi2xx.h&quot; - so one is left to wonder
where it is put. I suspect - it is in a *RANDOM* place - or not even
installed anywhere.

What should we do?

Option #1 - is - we assume the user has followed the instructions and 
&quot;installed the .
so file&quot; and nothing else.

    This leaves the need to have a --config-option to point where the 
&quot;.h&quot; file
    can be found.

Option #2 - is we assume did not install it -
   
    Should we expect the &quot;--config-option&quot; to point at the directory 
where they
    exploaded the tar ball.

Option #3 - Same as Option #2.
     But instead of linking with the &quot;.so&quot; file - we link with the 
static lib.

==================================================

 From a design point of view I am faced with a dilemma.

There is no defined way one would expect it the package to be installed :-(
So - what ever we do - we will force something on the user.

Basically we tell the user Do X/Y/Z - and it will work, do something 
else and it will not.
or we end up with configure option-hell.

==================================================

I suggest we do the following:

Remove:     --with-ftd2xx

Based on &quot;--enable-ftd2xx_libftdi&quot; - we look for the H and LIB files
we look in _the_standard_places_  ie:
    /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, and /usr/include,and /usr/local/include

And then demand/complain if the following items where not set.
These options will be used to resolve the problems - if needed.

(1) Add:         --with-ftd2xx-libdir=&lt;PATH&gt;
     It becomes yet another &quot;-I&quot; paths.

(2) Add:         --with-ftd2xx-incdir=&lt;PATH&gt;
    It becomes yet another &quot;-L&quot; and &quot;-rpath&quot; options
    (because it might be a 'shared library' in a non-standard place)

(3) Add:          --with-ftd2xx-zipdir=&lt;PATH&gt;
       Assumes you did not install it - just unzipped it
       Under cygwin, you downloaded the ZIP file
       And this is the directory where you unzipped it.

(4)  Add:         --with-libftd2xx-tardir=&lt;PATH&gt;
         Assumes you did not install it, just unzipped it.
         Same as (3) but for Linux/Unix
         We would default to the *static* version.

(5) MingWin - And I am not sure about MingW32 situation.
      I believe one of the above might handle the situation.
      Can somebody offer a comment ( ? Spen ? )

Problems:
      Dealing with &quot;i386&quot; vrs &quot;x86_64&quot; subdirectories
     I'm looking for an autoconf reference if there is a standard way or 
not.
      If somebody knows this already - a reference would be helpful.

==================================================

TEST -

I cannot test all combinations - help will be appreciated.

==================================================

**END**

-Duane.
