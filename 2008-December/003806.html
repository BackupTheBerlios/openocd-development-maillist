<PRE>For those who do not know - I am a new commit person for OpenOCD.

I have just committed a large (in size) but small (in scope) patch. The 
patch is 300K, I did not attach it.

There may be some &quot;bumps&quot; in the road, they should be sorted out 
*QUICKLY*.  

If you are reading this and
* you are a &quot;packager&quot; type for others - please don't jump on this 
change for a week or two.
* FYI - Those that package openocd - in case you have not heard we are 
working towards a 1.0 release.

meanwhile - if you can test something - please do - I've tested all I 
could test (see the list below).

-Overview of changes follow -

========================

(A) I have updated the DOCUMENTATION - to reflect all of the changes below.
Yes - There is now updated documentation! Be Happy!
Hopefully soon the WEB version of the docs will be updated.
(I don't know how to do that yet)

I tried to explain many of the new features in depth and in detail.
(Could somebody proof read/spell check/grammar check - I am notorious 
please...)
This change alone - made the PATCH file huge.

========================

(B)   The primary goal is/was to support &quot;jtag route controllers&quot; aka: JRC.
Example:  TI OMAP3530 - (aka: BeagleBoard) has one, as does the STR912 
which was &quot;a hack&quot; to get working.

What makes the patch seem large is this:
(1) A common &quot;struct fields&quot; no longer has a member: &quot;int device&quot;
(2) Many functions had an &quot;int chain_pos&quot; parameter (various names)
(3) The integer index for(;;) loops over the chain are gone.

They have been replaced with a &quot;jtag_tap_t *tapptr&quot;
and a new function: &quot;jtag_NextEnabledTap()&quot;

========================

(C)  To make the JRC stuff work right the &quot;jtag_device&quot; command is gone.
And was replaced with &quot;jtag newtap&quot;

The old command syntax was:
    jtag_device  IRLEN IRCAPTURE IRMASK
The new command is:
   jtag  newtap CHIP TAP  -irmask NUMBER -ircapture NUMBER -irmask 
NUMBER .... other parameters

This effects almost all &quot;.cfg&quot; files for targets.

========================

(D) Testing - yes, I have done quite a bit.
    I also have created quite a few new CONFIG fles
    And split the &quot;target&quot; directory into &quot;board&quot; and &quot;target&quot;.

    I tested these changes with:

CortexM3
       ST STM3210E-Eval (stm32 cortexM3)
       ST STM32F10x-128k-eval

Arm7TDMI
       Sharp LH379532 eval board
       Olimex SAM7x256
       ARM Evaluator 7T

Arm926
       LogicPD IMX27

Arm920t
       Atmel AT91RM9200-DK (I do not have the new EK board).

By test: I mean - for all the above boards.
        The TAPIDs verify. I can type reset, halt, and single step 
through code using OpenOCD.
         A few of them, I tested further with GDB.

========================

(E) What appears to be broken is my IAR Kick Start ST-912 eval board.
    Actually I think my configuration is broken.
    I could not make this work with older versions of OpenOCD.

*END*

-Duane.
