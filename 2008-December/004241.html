<PRE>dirk&gt; I would prefer shared to be default.

SHARED is the default, if the libftd2xx0.4.16 package is installed - &quot;in 
a proper way&quot; 

By proper way - I mean
=========================

This should work:

     &quot;gcc  myprogram.c  -lftd2xx&quot;

Which requires:

(1) the two .H files are in a standard include directory

(2) The .SO file has been copied
     And required symlinks be made...

(3) Or - the STATIC lib be installed instead.

As for &quot;shared or static&quot; - what matters is what *You* the developer 
install. OpenOCD expects the *standard* idiom &quot;-lftd2xx&quot; to work if it 
is installed.

An example of these steps can be found here:

${openocd}/testing/build.test1/Makefile
     TARGET:  linux.ftd2xx_installed.setup

=========================
Non-Installed - Why SHARED will not work by default
=========================

If it is not installed - then there is no way to link *shared* without 
manual intervention.

As delivered, the &quot;tar.gz&quot; file contains the file:  libftd2xx.so.0.4.16,

GCC will not link &quot;shared&quot; with the above,
The application will *NOT* run &quot;shared&quot; with the file named that way.

It is missing:  libftd2xx.so - which is what GCC/LD requires to link.
It is missing:  libftd2xx.so.0 - which is required to *RUN* (ldd wants this)

In fact, I think FTDICHIP.COM builds the library the wrong way, via 
&quot;-soname&quot;.

The *person building openocd* (ie: you) must - manually modify the 
ftd2xx.so.0.4.16 directory to make it work.  Either:  COPY or SYMLINK 
those two files into existence *SOMEWHERE* appropriate. 

It would be *WRONG* for openocd to *fix* it for you.
It would be *WRONG* for openocd to point &quot;rpath&quot; into that *wrong* 
directory.

Thus, the default in this scenario is &quot;static&quot; - the only thing that 
works with the &quot;as-delivered&quot; tar file.

In fact, I wrote this part of the configure script to be (I hope) 
&quot;future proofed&quot; in this way:
   If the &quot;un-numbered&quot; static lib version is present - we use that.
   Otherwise - we hunt for a triple-numbered static library and use that.

=========================
Not Fully Installed Shard Build Problems
(AKA: You followed the Broken Install Instructions)
========================

In effect, this is like having the evil two different RPM files under 
RedHat.
    (1) rpm holding the .SO files ... - which is installed
    (2) rpm holding the .H files... - which are *NOT* installed

If one follows the *BROKEN* instructions from FTDICHIP.COM
the .SO files are installed, but the .H files are not.

The brokenness is the .H files not being installed.

The solution here is:

./configure  --with-ftd2xx-lib=shared  \
           --with-ftd2xx-linux-dir=&lt;PATH&gt;

The &quot;--with-ftd2xx-lib=shared&quot; idiom means the *standard* idiom:  
&quot;-lftd2xx&quot; - should work

========================
Non-Installed Static Build Problems
========================

To be complete, there are similar problems with &quot;in-place&quot; STATIC 
library build on Linux.

 In the static_lib directory, the '.a' file is numbered Example: 
libftd2xx.a.0.4.16

GCC will not accept that with &quot;-L&quot; - the numbers are not valid, GCC/LD 
only link with &quot;.so&quot; and &quot;.a&quot; files via a (dash)(lower-letter-el) idiom.

Thus, in that case, the configure script actually has to figure out what 
the triple-numbered filename is - (ie: future proofing in case version 
numbers change) - and specify that file on command line, without the 
standard &quot;(dash)(lower-letter-el)&quot; idiom in front of it.

========================
Win32/Cygwin/MingW32
========================

If one ignores the *SPACES* in the ZIP filename!!!!
It is not as *MESSY* as the Linux side of this...

========================
MacOS -
========================

I have no idea:

1) I have no mac :-(
2) The MAC file is a DMG file... I don't know how to unpack.

I wonder if it is *JUST* as messy as the Linux solution.
I don't know.

========================
All of this seems *VERY* complicated...
Why doesn't FTDICHIP fix the stuff they are producing.
Why don't we approach FTDICHIP and ask them to fix.
========================

Well - first they should, and I believe they will, and I have.

You should note that they are coming out with a *NEW* version of the 
FTD2232 chip, the REV H file.

Big pluses:

* USB 2.0 high speed (480mbit)
* 30mhz jtag speed, not 6mhz,
* support for RTCK
* sadly only 3.3V io, no 1.8V io support

I should have an eval board in a 3 to 4 weeks. I do not know when 
end-product will be on the consumer shelf space.

I'm sure they will be updating their LIBs and files to support these chips.
&quot;in a proper way&quot; - and will fix their documentation &quot;in a proper way&quot;..
