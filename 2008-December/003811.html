<PRE>duane&gt; What is the required work area size?

rick&gt;  None.  The flash methods ....

Actually the flash methods do need space - otherwise they will not work.

Thank you for pointing out the flash - I had forgotten about that.

There are two sides to the problem.

(A) flash programing - I had forgotten. Happens, but not as frequently.
(B) General GDB downloading: Happens all the time.

I dug around a little... and this is what I found.

-Duane.

DCC download requires 24 bytes.
Poking around the flash code I see this:
 ie: LPC2000 I see something 172 bytes needed
I see stuff in the CFI Intel flash code talking about 1K bytes.
All FLASH code has the same copy/paste loop that wants something more 
then 256 bytes

================================

Based on my read of the code:

I think this would be &quot;good manual/documentation policy&quot;

(A) From a *manual* point of view.
    Flash programing requires at least :
         1K ram for micro-controllers (internal flash)
         2K ram for any external flash.
    For *large* system on a chip solutions - 2K is enough
    However we recommend 4K on systems with SDRAM.

(B) From a *manual* point of view..
    We tell users:
    If at all possible - dedicate a N-Byte region for the DCC.

    Today N = 24 bytes, but think future. 
    Should the manual say 64 bytes - or 128 bytes?
    And use the extra bytes for data abort capturing (if needed)

(C) FUTURE:
    Maybe we even create a &quot;-dcc-work-area&quot; target option?
    It would always be backed up and restored ..
    And - it needs to be smart about GDB loading over the top of it.

    Maybe we create a &quot;-flash-work-area&quot; target option?

    Today - existing OpenOCD code treats &quot;work area as work area&quot; 
generically.

(D) On chips like ARM 9 - that have Vector Catch.
    Vector Catch should be enabled during this period.
    And &quot;restored to previous state&quot; when done.
    Perhaps this should be on any time &quot;run algorithm&quot; is used.

(E) Not sure about Vector Catch on Arm7.
    Not familiar enough with arm11 and cortex variants.

(F) Some places for work could be:
     Improve the flash algorithms to &quot;ping-pong&quot;buffers
    ie: Instead of polling the flash for completion
    Start downloading the next sector.
