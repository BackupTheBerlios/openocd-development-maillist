OK, someday when I have write access I will stuff the two programs into 
there.   My SVF2XSVF converter has an option to include original source 
file line numbers, as XCOMMENT records, like (&quot;%s @%d&quot;, xsvfcommand, 
line_number).   This line number is from the original *.svf text file.


This makes it possible to find out what is actually happening at the 
point of failure.  I made xsvf.c print these XCOMMENTs.

</I>&gt;<i>

The XSVF file format seems reasonably well thought out.  I was not 
enamored with xilinx's conversion program, and not having source to it 
was quite bothersome.


Python is easy to maintain and read and seems reasonably fast.  Note I 
used Python 3000, i.e. version 3.0, which would cause some folks to have 
to upgrade.  Eventually that will probably be the standard python as 3.0 
overcomes 2.6.


Also, be aware that most python programs use spaces, not tabs for 
indentation.  This is also something I found nice.   Tabs are a nuisance 
and have out lived their day in my opinion.  I stopped using them around 
1988 when I got my first &quot;really big&quot; hard drive and there were 10 
programmers all of whom were arguing about tab widths, etc.  Spaces 
settle that issue cleanly, and uniformly.  The python adopters mostly 
seem to agree with this.

I am one of two main active developers of Kicad.  For that project I put 
in a standard configuration file for the very fine beautifier called 
&quot;uncrustify&quot;.  So basically uncrustify settles the issue for us over 
there.  That is C++ and it is setup for spaces, but uncrustify will 
handle both, depending on the configuration file.
