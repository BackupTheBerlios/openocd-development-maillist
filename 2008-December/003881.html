<PRE>Please feel free to provide commentary on any and all portions of  
this.  I've written it in the format I expect to use for future status  
updates.

Summary
-------------
The majority of the development work for 1.0 GM has already been  
committed to trunk but has yet to be integrated into the RELENG_1  
branch.  Many non-development tasks need to be performed after 1.0 GM  
has been declared before FCS can occur.  The bulk of that work is  
related to building a list of officially supported host OSes and  
devices.  The tentative schedule is to declare GMc by 12/14/2008, GM  
by 1/1/2009, and FCS by 2/1/2009.

Terminology
-----------------
In the course of planning for the OpenOCD 1.0 release, I will be using  
a number of terms commonly used in software program management.  I'm  
including a quick reference for some of these terms for those  
unfamiliar.

GM - Gold Master
The complete source base that the released source and binary  
distributions will be built from.  This will be tagged in Subversion  
as part of the release process so the exact sources used for the  
release can be retrieved should they be necessary.

GMc - Gold Master Candidate
Once all of the source and documentation tasks are complete, a source  
distribution will be built with the intention of being the release  
version.  Final testing in performed on this distribution and if no  
issues are found, it becomes the GM.

FCS - First Customer Ship
After the GM has been declared, tagged out in Subversion, and the  
source distribution has been created, there will be a period of time  
before all of the binary distributions are ready.  When the supported  
binary distributions are ready, the source and binary distributions  
will be posted to the OpenOCD project page.  The posting is considered  
FCS.

Supported device
Any device which OpenOCD can identify and interact with.

Officially supported device
Any supported device that has passed the defined test criteria when  
using the GM sources on an officially supported host OS.

Supported host OS
Any OS on which OpenOCD has previously been verified to compile and  
execute for general usage.

Officially supported host OS
Any supported host OS that has passed the defined test criteria when  
using the GM sources against an officially supported device.


Overview of tasks for 1.0 GM
-----------------------------------
- Code changes
   - Remove deprecated/obsolete syntaxes
   - Add support for JTAG route controllers
- Reorganize and update documentation
- Officially supported device/OS testing
   - Define criteria for officially supported devices (what tests must  
pass on GMc)
   - Obtain test devices for all supported interfaces, targets, plds,  
and boards
   - Draft test matrix of supported host OSes and devices including  
contributors capable of testing configurations
   - Verify all supported devices meet test criteria
- Binary releases

Code changes
---------------------
All of the major code changes to be included in the 1.0 GM have  
already been committed to trunk, but have yet to be integrated into  
the RELENG_1 branch.

The new JTAG route controller support was an extensive change that  
touched many areas of the source base.  Preliminary testing has  
already been done, but further testing needs to be done on various  
host OSes and devices before the changes can be considered stable and  
ready for integration into RELENG_1.

The removal of obsolete and deprecated syntaxes is a relatively small  
set of changes and has minimal risk.  These changes will be integrated  
into RELENG_1 in the new week.

Documentation changes
----------------------------------
While the first batch of documentation changes have been committed to  
trunk, the newly restructure document needs to be proofread and  
checked for accuracy.  Once the remaining author's notes and  
outstanding feedback have been addressed, it will be ready for a merge  
into RELENG_1.

Officially supported device/OS testing
--------------------------------------------------
To ensure that users, both new and old, can easily determine whether  
OpenOCD will work with the host OS and devices they wish to use, a  
list of officially supported host OSes and devices needs to be  
developed to coincide with the 1.0 FCS.  Officially supported host  
OSes and devices are determined by defining a set of test criteria and  
then evaluating a host OS or device against those criteria.  Only host  
OSes and devices that passed the test criteria when using the GM  
source distribution can be considered officially supported.  The  
resulting list of officially supported host OSes and devices will be  
published as part of the FCS process.

Binary releases
---------------------
After GM, a set of binary releases need to be created for common host  
OSes.  The releases should use the host OS package format and be  
tested against the criteria for an officially supported host OS.

Schedule
-------------
GMc	12/14/2008
GM		1/1/2009
FCS	2/1/2009

Being the first release of OpenOCD, it is vital that quality is  
exceptionally high and the new user experience is thought out.  That  
said, this is a fairly aggressive schedule and as such is at risk  
should any major problems be encountered during testing.
