I don't know.  We should find out.  There seem to be 2 votes so far for
it not being a problem, but neither they, nor I, are lawyers.  I am not
counting myself in those votes, because I'm obviously going to be
biased.

I don't want to cause trouble for anybody.  On the other hand, if it's
not a legal problem, it would be a shame to disqualify the device
support because somebody thinks it might be.  Several somebodys, maybe.
Somebody(s) who actually does know how the law applies here, sure.

There are a lot of pieces of hardware out there that would not be supported
under non-Windows OSes if not for of this sort of work.

Googling for the phrase &quot;reverse engineering for interoperability&quot; turns
up lots of encouraging-looking results.

Does that mean that that is now a closed interface?
