<PRE>I have a few issues with debugging a STM32-SK board (using eclipse with 
the latest Zylin plugin)

I have modified the IAR application so it would work with my arm-elf-gcc 
compiler. I use the latest SVN code and have no issue yet with
it.  My gcc is version 4.4.0 and gdb 6.8. Eclipse is the latest (3.4.1) 
installed as a user. The one that comes with Fedora 9 is too buggy.
I have my own eclipse plugin for C projects derived from the gnuarm plugin.

Everything seems to work fine except that I don't see my LCD display. If 
I power down and back up it works fine.
The tracing appears to show that the code is doing exactly what it is 
supposed to do. It reads an ADC port and displayed the data on the LCD.
If I halt and resume from within a telnet session everything is cool. 
The same sequence doesn't bring my LCD if I have gdb running in
the background. Even when gdb is out of the picture (session terminated) 
I cannot get the LCD back on. I can trace without a problem and
there doesn't appear to have any issue. I can press on the reset button 
all I want with no change whatsoever.

I would disconnect the jtag connector, press on reset and the LCD still 
won't come on. Cycling the power will fix it.



Also I get this most of the time when debugging but not always
