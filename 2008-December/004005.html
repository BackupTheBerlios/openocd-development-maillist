A different thread with subject &quot;JTAG Events&quot;.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for the more general &quot;taps - as objects&quot; - that can happen when

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If we can agree how we want it to work, I'll make it happen.  I just  
prefer not to code without a plan.

&gt;<i> ================
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for &quot;jtag events&quot; - I think perhaps there could be a series of  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;jtag events&quot;  not exactly bound to a tap.
</I>&gt;<i> That might be a simpler and perhaps more effective solution. Why? I  
</I>&gt;<i> say that because all of the other taps
</I>&gt;<i> are tied together via the tap chain in some way. I suspect we'll hit  
</I>&gt;<i> wacky problems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The two events that I defined in the other thread are tied to a  
specific tap.  There are definitely other events that apply to the  
whole chain (TRST and SRST asserted for example).  We should handle  
both cases gracefully.

&gt;<i> We could for example create a command:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       &quot;jtag newevent [--append]  EVENTNAME   EVENTBODY.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That would execute the the EVENTBODY based on some event that occurs  
</I>&gt;<i> = note: the that means &quot;all taps&quot; not one specific tap.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
There is already some infrastructure for this but it uses function  
pointers rather than Jim_Objs.  We could easily make it work.

&gt;&gt;<i> Doing this should also make adding other protocols like SWJ, I2C,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and SPI easier.  The tap objects can be a generic struct that  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contains a type identifier.  This type would indicate which  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> protocol it uses and also indicates the other members of the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> struct.  Then, each protocol would have a top-level command similar  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the &quot;jtag&quot; command.  That command would have a &quot;newtap&quot;  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> subcommand that takes the appropriate operands for that protocol.   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then when creating a target, the tap is specified.  The target  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could inspect the tap to determine if it can use a tap of that  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> type.  That would provide sufficient decoupling between the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> protocols and the targets to allow new protocols to be introduced  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with relative ease.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like the the &quot;K.I.S.S.&quot; principle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
As do I.  But sometimes K.I.S.S. actually turns out to be much more  
complex than you want.

&gt;<i> I think in some ways - we are making this just a tad bit to  
</I>&gt;<i> complicated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The last bit here is certainly pushing the envelope to allow for  
future extension.  It is complex and probably should not be included  
in 1.0, but I think it is worthwhile for investigation.

&gt;<i> SPI should be it's own first class command, and there is no way I  
</I>&gt;<i> would want to mix JTAG + SPI at the same time.
</I>
Right, I would expect each protocol to have its own top-level  
command.  It is just that the top-level command serves to create  
&quot;taps&quot; that are also a top-level object.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the case of SPI or I2C - I am taking over the flash memory action  
</I>&gt;<i> to force something onto the chip.
</I>
Very true, but ultimately, you can think of them as &quot;taps&quot; or  
&quot;endpoints&quot; that you are communicating with.  You could, for example,  
have the same flash driver be able to work with SPI or I2C variants of  
the same basic flash chip design.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In stark contrast: In jtag case - I am cooperating with the chip. A  
</I>&gt;<i> big difference.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hence why at the other side of the pipeline we have targets, plds, and  
flash.

&gt;<i> -Duane.

it with him.&quot;
