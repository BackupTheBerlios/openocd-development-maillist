<PRE>rick&gt; As my other patch shows, such a mechanism simplifies interacting 
with a JTAG route controller, so the mechanism would already be in place.

I missed that - where is this at?

duane&gt; {taps as objects}

rick&gt; [name space is the real issue]

Agreed.

As for the more general &quot;taps - as objects&quot; - that can happen when 
someone wants to write that code.

================

As for &quot;jtag events&quot; - I think perhaps there could be a series of &quot;jtag 
events&quot;  not exactly bound to a tap.
That might be a simpler and perhaps more effective solution. Why? I say 
that because all of the other taps
are tied together via the tap chain in some way. I suspect we'll hit 
wacky problems.

We could for example create a command:

        &quot;jtag newevent [--append]  EVENTNAME   EVENTBODY.&quot;

That would execute the the EVENTBODY based on some event that occurs = 
note: the that means &quot;all taps&quot; not one specific tap.

&gt;<i> Doing this should also make adding other protocols like SWJ, I2C, and 
</I>&gt;<i> SPI easier.  The tap objects can be a generic struct that contains a 
</I>&gt;<i> type identifier.  This type would indicate which protocol it uses and 
</I>&gt;<i> also indicates the other members of the struct.  Then, each protocol 
</I>&gt;<i> would have a top-level command similar to the &quot;jtag&quot; command.  That 
</I>&gt;<i> command would have a &quot;newtap&quot; subcommand that takes the appropriate 
</I>&gt;<i> operands for that protocol.  Then when creating a target, the tap is 
</I>&gt;<i> specified.  The target could inspect the tap to determine if it can 
</I>&gt;<i> use a tap of that type.  That would provide sufficient decoupling 
</I>&gt;<i> between the protocols and the targets to allow new protocols to be 
</I>&gt;<i> introduced with relative ease.
</I>
I like the the &quot;K.I.S.S.&quot; principle.

I think in some ways - we are making this just a tad bit to complicated.

SPI should be it's own first class command, and there is no way I would 
want to mix JTAG + SPI at the same time.
In the case of SPI or I2C - I am taking over the flash memory action to 
force something onto the chip.
In stark contrast: In jtag case - I am cooperating with the chip. A big 
difference.

-Duane.
