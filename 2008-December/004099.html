It is described in the README file in the new rlink directory.  If there
is a better place to do that, it can certainly be changed.

This is, indeed, one of those blue moon situations.  People aren't going
to be editing the DTC code (init.m4 and call.m4) much.

So does that mean that what I have is good?

</I>
I had a similar (though less radical than needing eCos source) concern
with the requirement for perl and m4.  Though those are both very common
programs, it is probably best to not assume that everybody who's building
OpenOCD will have them installed.  Granted, one could assume m4 if one is
running bootstrap, but perhaps not if they're just running ./configure in
a distribution tarball.
