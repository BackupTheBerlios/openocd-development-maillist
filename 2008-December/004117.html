</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rlink.c and rlink_speed_table.c, and that leads us well down that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; slippery slope of namespace clutter I alluded to earlier. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> prototypes) would be better IMHO.
</I>
You can see it by looking in the patch, the table is a pointer and a
couple of shorts/chars per speed, and there are currently 4 speeds
(though there could be up to 64, depending on certain design decisions).
The pointers point to char arrays of 250-300 bytes per speed.

Even with the logical extreme of 64 speeds, it oughtn't take too awfully
long to compile that.  It would take just as long to compile it to its
own .o file, anyway.

&gt;<i> &gt; Previously, there wasn't even a speed_table.c.  The khz/prescaler table
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was directly in rlink.c, and the DTC blobs were loaded from binary files
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at runtime.  That still had the same issue of how/when to build those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; files and added the possibility of mismatch between the version of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rlink driver and the version of the blob files found on a given system.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; While I generally dislike programs embedding blobs in themselves like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that, the cons of having the files separate but in the search path
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; outweighed the niceness of not embedding.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> Hm - the XScale target has the same problem: the debug stub that is
</I>&gt;<i> downloaded to the target is not compiled-in, but loaded from a binary
</I>&gt;<i> file. It seems to work fine as long as the dependency is clearly documented.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> cu
</I>&gt;<i> Michael
</I>
It worked fine, mostly.  But I found that searching always searches the
builtin path before any specified on the command line, so I was
running into problems where testing a not yet installed version would have
a mismatch because the blobs for the installed version were getting used.
Looking for the binaries in only the install location, besides me not
knowing how to find out where that is, would make it impossible to
test/run openocd before it is installed, since no files, or the wrong
ones, would be found.

Granted, the usual case is to run the version of openocd that is
installed.
