</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for breaking threading on this reply, I'm not going to be at my

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm the &quot;other person&quot; mentioned in Lou's e-mail; I'd like to  
</I>&gt;<i> provide a
</I>&gt;<i> bit of background on this driver, so that people with knowledge about
</I>&gt;<i> these sorts of issues can maybe decide whether our code is OK for
</I>&gt;<i> inclusion in OpenOCD. If this discussion isn't appropriate for this  
</I>&gt;<i> list,
</I>&gt;<i> please accept my apologies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My impression, and IANAL, is that this work comes squarely under the
</I>&gt;<i> description of &quot;reverse engineering for interoperability&quot; and there  
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> no legal issues. I don't see that we've done anything much different
</I>&gt;<i> to what the Samba project has, for example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What we've done is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Log USB traffic between the RIDE software and the STM32-Primer  
</I>&gt;<i> board,
</I>&gt;<i>   which is described as an &quot;embedded R-Link&quot; on the stm32circle.com
</I>&gt;<i>   website.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Noted patterns in the USB traffic, particularly packets which were
</I>&gt;<i>   clearly &quot;write-to-memory&quot; and &quot;read-from-memory&quot; commands. Using  
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i>   ability, I read out the R-Link firmware which is basically the USB
</I>&gt;<i>   library from ST plus a few command handlers. This provided details  
</I>&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;<i>   some of the other commands that USB packets can contain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Combed the data sheet for the ST72651 CPU in the R-Link. This has  
</I>&gt;<i> scant
</I>&gt;<i>   details of a peripheral called &quot;Data Transfer Coprocessor&quot; (DTC),  
</I>&gt;<i> which
</I>&gt;<i>   is used for handling data transfer between USB and various devices
</I>&gt;<i>   (memory cards etc). For some unfathomable reason, ST have decided  
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i>   to document the DTC, but prefer to provide customers with firmware
</I>&gt;<i>   blobs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) By looking at (freely downloadable) resources on ST's site, such as
</I>&gt;<i>   sample code for ST7 development boards, we were able to piece  
</I>&gt;<i> together
</I>&gt;<i>   the DTC instruction set, and through a lot of experimentation we've
</I>&gt;<i>   gained a pretty good understanding of how the DTC actually works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as Spencer Oliver's comment about a &quot;closed interface&quot; goes, I
</I>&gt;<i> don't think we're using anything that is (or could be) &quot;closed&quot;.  
</I>&gt;<i> It's just
</I>&gt;<i> undocumented :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5) Wrote an OpenOCD driver using the information gathered in the  
</I>&gt;<i> previous
</I>&gt;<i>   steps. The driver is possibly not optimal, due to our incomplete
</I>&gt;<i>   knowledge about the components that we're dealing with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some things that I think might be important:
</I>&gt;<i> - No encryption, or any technology designed to control access, was
</I>&gt;<i>  bypassed in this work. There is no such technology in the R-Link.
</I>&gt;<i> - There is no intention to bypass license control technology. The R- 
</I>&gt;<i> Link
</I>&gt;<i>  comes in &quot;Basic&quot; and &quot;Pro&quot; flavours, with the Basic model code-space
</I>&gt;<i>  limited when debugging with the RIDE software. We have no idea how  
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i>  licensing works, we have no interest, and we aren't (knowingly)
</I>&gt;<i>  distributing any information that would enable anyone else to bypass
</I>&gt;<i>  that licensing.
</I>&gt;<i> - The work we've done doesn't distribute any copyrighted work.  
</I>&gt;<i> Especially,
</I>&gt;<i>  the R-Link firmware and Raisonance DTC blobs are not included, in  
</I>&gt;<i> whole
</I>&gt;<i>  or in part, in the OpenOCD code we're offering.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The way RIDE handles debugging seems quite different to OpenOCD,  
</I>&gt;<i> looking
</I>&gt;<i> at USB logs. Once again, we don't know nor particularly care about how
</I>&gt;<i> RIDE operates.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As an aside, I'm planning to publish the information we've gathered  
</I>&gt;<i> about
</I>&gt;<i> the DTC on my website in a few days, if you're interested get in  
</I>&gt;<i> touch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Rob.

IANAL either, but this seems to be clean-room reverse engineering for  
interoperability.  That is generally considered OK in the US.  I don't  
foresee the rlink support being a problem, but if one wanted to ask  
the manufacturer we would have a clear answer.  We do lose plausible  
deniability (I really hate that term) in that case though.

&quot;He said he hadn't had a byte in three days. I had a short, so I split  
it with him.&quot;
