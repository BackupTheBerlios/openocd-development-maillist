If it is small, generating a .h that is included is fine with me.
However, if it gets bigger (and thus requires substantial time for
compiling the table alone), then a separate .c file (just as you
described - with an additional integer for size, plus a .h with the
prototypes) would be better IMHO.

&gt;<i> Previously, there wasn't even a speed_table.c.  The khz/prescaler table
</I>&gt;<i> was directly in rlink.c, and the DTC blobs were loaded from binary files
</I>&gt;<i> at runtime.  That still had the same issue of how/when to build those
</I>&gt;<i> files and added the possibility of mismatch between the version of the
</I>&gt;<i> rlink driver and the version of the blob files found on a given system.
</I>&gt;<i> While I generally dislike programs embedding blobs in themselves like
</I>&gt;<i> that, the cons of having the files separate but in the search path
</I>&gt;<i> outweighed the niceness of not embedding.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Hm - the XScale target has the same problem: the debug stub that is
downloaded to the target is not compiled-in, but loaded from a binary
file. It seems to work fine as long as the dependency is clearly documented.
