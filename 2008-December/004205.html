<PRE>Now that I've read through code for all the JTAG interface drivers  
(including the 2 new ones), it seems that every single driver does  
mass duplication of the JTAG state machine handling.  The state  
machine is defined as part of the JTAG standard (although it does  
allow for extension) and all of the uses in the driver seem to be due  
to the driver interface rather than the driver doing something unique.

The problems seems to be that the when a user queues a JTAG operation,  
it is encoded as a command.  The possible commands are scan,  
statemove, pathmove, runtest, reset, end_state, and sleep.  These  
commands are used in the generic code to determine whether the state  
moves are allowed and for generic validation, but then are passed to  
the drivers.  Each driver then has the same block of code that figure  
out which command is next in the queue, consults a state lookup table  
for each command, and then does some work to build up the bytes to  
send to the interface.

If we instead kept all the state handling in the generic JTAG code and  
the driver model was based around states, much of the duplicated code  
would go away.  The generic code would deal with breaking a command  
into the appropriate state movements and the driver could be passed an  
array of JTAG state changes.  That still keeps the overall number of  
function calls to the driver down while making the driver much simpler.

Thoughts?

&quot;He said he hadn't had a byte in three days. I had a short, so I split  
it with him.&quot;
