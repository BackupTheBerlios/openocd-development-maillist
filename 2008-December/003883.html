</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Summary
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The majority of the development work for 1.0 GM has already been

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> before FCS can occur.  The bulk of that work is related to building  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a list
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of officially supported host OSes and devices.  The tentative  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> schedule is to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> declare GMc by 12/14/2008, GM by 1/1/2009, and FCS by 2/1/2009.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's do GMc no sooner than jan 1. 2009
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I wrote it originally with GMc 1/1/2009, but 1 month seemed like a  
long time given that all of the major code contributions are already  
done.

&gt;&gt;<i> Terminology
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -----------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the course of planning for the OpenOCD 1.0 release, I will be  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> number of terms commonly used in software program management.  I'm  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> including
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a quick reference for some of these terms for those unfamiliar.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia reference?
</I>
I didn't use one.  This is drawn from personal experience with a  
number of software companies.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> GM - Gold Master
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The complete source base that the released source and binary  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distributions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be built from.  This will be tagged in Subversion as part of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> release process so the exact sources used for the release can be  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> retrieved
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should they be necessary.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> GMc - Gold Master Candidate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Once all of the source and documentation tasks are complete, a source
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distribution will be built with the intention of being the release  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> version.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Final testing in performed on this distribution and if no issues  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are found,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it becomes the GM.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> FCS - First Customer Ship
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> After the GM has been declared, tagged out in Subversion, and the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> source
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distribution has been created, there will be a period of time  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> before all of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the binary distributions are ready.  When the supported binary  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distributions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are ready, the source and binary distributions will be posted to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the OpenOCD
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> project page.  The posting is considered FCS.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Supported device
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any device which OpenOCD can identify and interact with.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Officially supported device
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any supported device that has passed the defined test criteria when  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the GM sources on an officially supported host OS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we should refrain from endorsing hardware or saying that  
</I>&gt;<i> something
</I>&gt;<i> is &quot;officially supported&quot;. It either passed the test for a specific
</I>&gt;<i> release or it didn't.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Officially supported implies something about the future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Not really.  The intent is define a set of host OSes and devices that  
are known to work with a specific release.  If we want to call it  
something other than &quot;officially supported&quot;, that's fine, but we  
should come up with a term.

&gt;<i> The OpenOCD policy is that all hardware is equal. The only thing that
</I>&gt;<i> distinguishes
</I>&gt;<i> it is testing and patches contributed
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sure, so anything that OpenOCD knows how to talk to is considered  
supported, but that doesn't eliminate the need for knowing which  
devices have been tested against a given release.

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Supported host OS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any OS on which OpenOCD has previously been verified to compile and  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> execute
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for general usage.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Officially supported host OS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any supported host OS that has passed the defined test criteria  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the GM sources against an officially supported device.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Change &quot;supported&quot; by &quot;passes tests in this release&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Overview of tasks for 1.0 GM
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -----------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Code changes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Remove deprecated/obsolete syntaxes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Add support for JTAG route controllers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Reorganize and update documentation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Officially supported device/OS testing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Define criteria for officially supported devices (what tests must  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pass on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> GMc)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> see openocd/testing directory for a start.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Obtain test devices for all supported interfaces, targets, plds,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> boards
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The community must do these tests. This hardware will *never*
</I>&gt;<i> be assembled in the same physical location.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Correct.  So, we should try to build a list of people who are willing  
to do testing and what devices and host OSes they are willing to test  
on.  That way we know that when a GMc is ready, we have at least a  
subset of devices available for testing.

&gt;<i> Test results can be submitted *after* the FCS.
</I>
Certainly, but it is best to have the testing done before FCS if  
possible.  That way any device-specific or OS specific bugs can be  
encountered and resolved or documented for the release.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Draft test matrix of supported host OSes and devices including
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contributors capable of testing configurations
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Verify all supported devices meet test criteria
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Binary releases
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Code changes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ---------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All of the major code changes to be included in the 1.0 GM have  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> committed to trunk, but have yet to be integrated into the RELENG_1  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> branch.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The new JTAG route controller support was an extensive change that  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> touched
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> many areas of the source base.  Preliminary testing has already  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been done,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but further testing needs to be done on various host OSes and  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> devices before
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the changes can be considered stable and ready for integration into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RELENG_1.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The removal of obsolete and deprecated syntaxes is a relatively  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> small set of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changes and has minimal risk.  These changes will be integrated into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RELENG_1 in the new week.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Documentation changes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ----------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> While the first batch of documentation changes have been committed  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to trunk,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the newly restructure document needs to be proofread and checked for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accuracy.  Once the remaining author's notes and outstanding  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> feedback have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been addressed, it will be ready for a merge into RELENG_1.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Officially supported device/OS testing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> --------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To ensure that users, both new and old, can easily determine  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whether OpenOCD
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;whether a version of OpenOCD will work with&quot;.... there is no
</I>&gt;<i> guarantee about the future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, the results of testing will be specific to a host OS, host  
architecture, OpenOCD version, dongle, and target device.

&gt;&gt;<i> will work with the host OS and devices they wish to use, a list of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> officially supported host OSes and devices needs to be developed to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> coincide
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the 1.0 FCS.  Officially supported host OSes and devices are  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> determined
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by defining a set of test criteria and then evaluating a host OS or  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> device
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> against those criteria.  Only host OSes and devices that passed the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> test
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> criteria when using the GM source distribution can be considered  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> officially
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> supported.  The resulting list of officially supported host OSes  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and devices
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be published as part of the FCS process.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Binary releases
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ---------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> After GM, a set of binary releases need to be created for common  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> host OSes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The releases should use the host OS package format and be tested  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> against
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the criteria for an officially supported host OS.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Schedule
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> GMc     12/14/2008
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> GM              1/1/2009
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> FCS     2/1/2009
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Being the first release of OpenOCD, it is vital that quality is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exceptionally high and the new user experience is thought out.   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That said,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this is a fairly aggressive schedule and as such is at risk should  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any major
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problems be encountered during testing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a general comment I'd like to see the release process a bit
</I>&gt;<i> more open source oriented. Also, most of the contributions are
</I>&gt;<i> from amateurs(testing and development), so we have little control
</I>&gt;<i> over how and when things are done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The traditional open source way is to pick a source revision, mark it  
with a new version number, and put it on a website.  While that works,  
it leads to lots of pain and suffering for users.  Not only are  
releases rarely tested, but it isn't entirely clear what was changed  
or that the changes were actually stable.

The goal in any release coordination, open source or commercial, is to  
set expectations.  If tentative dates are not set, you end up with the  
FreeBSD 5 fiasco.  I entirely expect contributors to pitch in as they  
can and the actual dates to change.  But by setting expectations and  
goals, the set of items to be included in OpenOCD 1.0 is well defined  
and the criteria for its release is also well defined.  Setting target  
dates for major milestones simply provides some guidance and incentive  
to get fixes in now rather than waiting.  If those dates arrive and  
things are in a bad state of affairs, the dates will get changed.

&gt;<i> OpenOCD is free as in free speech, so we do not &quot;support&quot; anything.
</I>
There are multiple levels of &quot;support.&quot;  OpenOCD, software or  
community, does not offer contractual support, paid support, or any  
other form of dedicated support.  The OpenOCD community does however  
know which devices work, which OSes work, what versions are best to  
use, etc.  Putting that on a webpage or wiki is a form of support even  
if it does not constitute a contractual obligation.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are only patches being submitted and accepted and test results
</I>&gt;<i> recorded. That can yield a working version of OpenOCD of a combination
</I>&gt;<i> of OS+hardware or not.
</I>
I in no way intend to state or imply that the OpenOCD community will  
ensure that a certain set of devices will _always_ work for every  
release.  Rather, I would like to see each release have a  
corresponding list of tested configurations that are known to work.  I  
would also like to have contributors willing to do that testing when a  
release hits GMc.
