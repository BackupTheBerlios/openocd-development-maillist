I vote that we include rlink support.  If Raisonance complains, we can  
remove it.


&gt;<i> 5) Keeping rlink_speed_table.c prebuilt is deemed
</I>&gt;<i> fine, so no change needed there.  There was discussion of having a
</I>&gt;<i> separate area (eg: trunk/tools/{toolname}) for tools to do

</I>&gt;<i> That may be cleared up in a reply to that email, though.
</I>&gt;<i> It seemed like a good idea for the future,
</I>&gt;<i> but it would affect a number of drivers, most of which I do not

</I>&gt;<i> or even necessarily understand.  I could just unilaterally start  
</I>&gt;<i> putting
</I>&gt;<i> stuff in tools/{toolname}, but that's going to be pretty goofy if  
</I>&gt;<i> nobody

</I>&gt;<i> rlink part of that could, of course, be changed when all the others  
</I>&gt;<i> are,
</I>&gt;<i> later on, when such a thing gets instituted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Your options for this patch are:
- Do not include the tools
- Put the tools in trunk/tools/{toolname}

I would prefer the latter, but the former is acceptable as long as a  
the tools are included as a different patch at some point relatively  
soon.
