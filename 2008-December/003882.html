&gt;<i> Please feel free to provide commentary on any and all portions of this.
</I>&gt;<i>  I've written it in the format I expect to use for future status updates.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Summary
</I>&gt;<i> -------------
</I>&gt;<i> The majority of the development work for 1.0 GM has already been committed
</I>&gt;<i> to trunk but has yet to be integrated into the RELENG_1 branch.  Many
</I>&gt;<i> non-development tasks need to be performed after 1.0 GM has been declared
</I>&gt;<i> before FCS can occur.  The bulk of that work is related to building a list
</I>&gt;<i> of officially supported host OSes and devices.  The tentative schedule is to
</I>&gt;<i> declare GMc by 12/14/2008, GM by 1/1/2009, and FCS by 2/1/2009.
</I>
Let's do GMc no sooner than jan 1. 2009

&gt;<i> Terminology
</I>&gt;<i> -----------------
</I>&gt;<i> In the course of planning for the OpenOCD 1.0 release, I will be using a
</I>&gt;<i> number of terms commonly used in software program management.  I'm including
</I>&gt;<i> a quick reference for some of these terms for those unfamiliar.
</I>
Wikipedia reference?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> GM - Gold Master
</I>&gt;<i> The complete source base that the released source and binary distributions
</I>&gt;<i> will be built from.  This will be tagged in Subversion as part of the
</I>&gt;<i> release process so the exact sources used for the release can be retrieved
</I>&gt;<i> should they be necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> GMc - Gold Master Candidate
</I>&gt;<i> Once all of the source and documentation tasks are complete, a source
</I>&gt;<i> distribution will be built with the intention of being the release version.
</I>&gt;<i>  Final testing in performed on this distribution and if no issues are found,
</I>&gt;<i> it becomes the GM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> FCS - First Customer Ship
</I>&gt;<i> After the GM has been declared, tagged out in Subversion, and the source
</I>&gt;<i> distribution has been created, there will be a period of time before all of
</I>&gt;<i> the binary distributions are ready.  When the supported binary distributions
</I>&gt;<i> are ready, the source and binary distributions will be posted to the OpenOCD
</I>&gt;<i> project page.  The posting is considered FCS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Supported device
</I>&gt;<i> Any device which OpenOCD can identify and interact with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Officially supported device
</I>&gt;<i> Any supported device that has passed the defined test criteria when using
</I>&gt;<i> the GM sources on an officially supported host OS.
</I>
I think we should refrain from endorsing hardware or saying that something
is &quot;officially supported&quot;. It either passed the test for a specific
release or it didn't.

Officially supported implies something about the future.

The OpenOCD policy is that all hardware is equal. The only thing that
distinguishes
it is testing and patches contributed

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Supported host OS
</I>&gt;<i> Any OS on which OpenOCD has previously been verified to compile and execute
</I>&gt;<i> for general usage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Officially supported host OS
</I>&gt;<i> Any supported host OS that has passed the defined test criteria when using
</I>&gt;<i> the GM sources against an officially supported device.
</I>
Change &quot;supported&quot; by &quot;passes tests in this release&quot;.

&gt;<i> Overview of tasks for 1.0 GM
</I>&gt;<i> -----------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> - Code changes
</I>&gt;<i>  - Remove deprecated/obsolete syntaxes
</I>&gt;<i>  - Add support for JTAG route controllers
</I>&gt;<i> - Reorganize and update documentation
</I>&gt;<i> - Officially supported device/OS testing
</I>&gt;<i>  - Define criteria for officially supported devices (what tests must pass on
</I>&gt;<i> GMc)
</I>
see openocd/testing directory for a start.

&gt;<i>  - Obtain test devices for all supported interfaces, targets, plds, and
</I>&gt;<i> boards
</I>
The community must do these tests. This hardware will *never*
be assembled in the same physical location.

Test results can be submitted *after* the FCS.

&gt;<i>  - Draft test matrix of supported host OSes and devices including
</I>&gt;<i> contributors capable of testing configurations
</I>&gt;<i>  - Verify all supported devices meet test criteria
</I>&gt;<i> - Binary releases
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Code changes
</I>&gt;<i> ---------------------
</I>&gt;<i> All of the major code changes to be included in the 1.0 GM have already been
</I>&gt;<i> committed to trunk, but have yet to be integrated into the RELENG_1 branch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The new JTAG route controller support was an extensive change that touched
</I>&gt;<i> many areas of the source base.  Preliminary testing has already been done,
</I>&gt;<i> but further testing needs to be done on various host OSes and devices before
</I>&gt;<i> the changes can be considered stable and ready for integration into
</I>&gt;<i> RELENG_1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The removal of obsolete and deprecated syntaxes is a relatively small set of
</I>&gt;<i> changes and has minimal risk.  These changes will be integrated into
</I>&gt;<i> RELENG_1 in the new week.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Documentation changes
</I>&gt;<i> ----------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> While the first batch of documentation changes have been committed to trunk,
</I>&gt;<i> the newly restructure document needs to be proofread and checked for
</I>&gt;<i> accuracy.  Once the remaining author's notes and outstanding feedback have
</I>&gt;<i> been addressed, it will be ready for a merge into RELENG_1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Officially supported device/OS testing
</I>&gt;<i> --------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> To ensure that users, both new and old, can easily determine whether OpenOCD
</I>
&quot;whether a version of OpenOCD will work with&quot;.... there is no
guarantee about the future.

&gt;<i> will work with the host OS and devices they wish to use, a list of
</I>&gt;<i> officially supported host OSes and devices needs to be developed to coincide
</I>&gt;<i> with the 1.0 FCS.  Officially supported host OSes and devices are determined
</I>&gt;<i> by defining a set of test criteria and then evaluating a host OS or device
</I>&gt;<i> against those criteria.  Only host OSes and devices that passed the test
</I>&gt;<i> criteria when using the GM source distribution can be considered officially
</I>&gt;<i> supported.  The resulting list of officially supported host OSes and devices
</I>&gt;<i> will be published as part of the FCS process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Binary releases
</I>&gt;<i> ---------------------
</I>&gt;<i> After GM, a set of binary releases need to be created for common host OSes.
</I>&gt;<i>  The releases should use the host OS package format and be tested against
</I>&gt;<i> the criteria for an officially supported host OS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Schedule
</I>&gt;<i> -------------
</I>&gt;<i> GMc     12/14/2008
</I>&gt;<i> GM              1/1/2009
</I>&gt;<i> FCS     2/1/2009
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Being the first release of OpenOCD, it is vital that quality is
</I>&gt;<i> exceptionally high and the new user experience is thought out.  That said,
</I>&gt;<i> this is a fairly aggressive schedule and as such is at risk should any major
</I>&gt;<i> problems be encountered during testing.
</I>
As a general comment I'd like to see the release process a bit
more open source oriented. Also, most of the contributions are
from amateurs(testing and development), so we have little control
over how and when things are done.

OpenOCD is free as in free speech, so we do not &quot;support&quot; anything.
There are only patches being submitted and accepted and test results
recorded. That can yield a working version of OpenOCD of a combination
of OS+hardware or not.
