+TODO!!! this should be merged into openocd.texi!!!
+
+
+Prerequisites
+=============
+
+When building with support for FTDI FT2232 based devices, you need at least
+one of the following libraries:
+
+- libftdi (<A HREF="http://www.intra2net.com/opensource/ftdi/">http://www.intra2net.com/opensource/ftdi/</A>)
+- libftd2xx (<A HREF="http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm">http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm</A>)
+
+On Windows, you need either Cygwin or MinGW, but compilation for MinGW is also
+possible using a Cygwin host.
+
+Basic Installation
+==================
+
+   OpenOCD is distributed without autotools generated files, i.e. without a
+configure script. Run ./bootstrap in the openocd directory to have all
+necessary files generated.
+
+   You have to explicitly enable desired JTAG interfaces during configure:
+
+./configure --enable-parport --enable-ft2232-libftdi (OR
--enable-ft2232-ftd2xx) \
+            --enable-amtjtagaccel
+
+   Under Windows/Cygwin, only the ftd2xx driver is supported for FT2232 based
+devices. You have to specify the location of the FTDI driver package with the
+--with-ftd2xx=/full/path/name option.
+
+Under Linux you can choose to build the parport driver with support for
+/dev/parportN instead of the default access with direct port I/O using
+--enable-parport_ppdev. This has the advantage of running OpenOCD without root
+privileges at the expense of a slight performance decrease. This is also
+available on FreeBSD using PPI, but the naming of the devices is different.
+
+Generic installation instructions
+=================================
+
+   These are generic installation instructions.
+
+   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
+various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
+those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
+It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
+definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
+you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
+`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
+reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
+(useful mainly for debugging `configure').
+
+   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
+to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
+diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
+be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
+contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.
+
+   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
+called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
+it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.
+
+The simplest way to compile this package is:
+
+  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
+     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
+     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
+     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
+     `configure' itself.
+
+     Running `configure' takes a while.  While running, it prints some
+     messages telling which features it is checking for.
+
+  2. Type `make' to compile the package.
+
+  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
+     documentation.
+
+  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
+     source code directory by typing `make clean'.
+
+Compilers and Options
+=====================
+
+   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
+the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
+initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
+a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
+this:
+     CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure
+
+Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
+     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure
+
+Compiling For Multiple Architectures
+====================================
+
+   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
+same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
+own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
+supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
+directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
+the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
+source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.
+
+   If you have to use a `make' that does not supports the `VPATH'
+variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a time
+in the source code directory.  After you have installed the package for
+one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring for another
+architecture.
+
+Installation Names
+==================
+
+   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
+`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
+installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
+option `--prefix=PATH'.
+
+   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
+architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
+give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
+PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
+Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.
+
+   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
+with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
+option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.
+
+Optional Features
+=================
+
+   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
+`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
+They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
+is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
+`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
+package recognizes.
+
+   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
+find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
+you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
+`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.
+
+Specifying the System Type
+==========================
+
+   There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
+automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host the package
+will run on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
+a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
+`--host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
+type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:
+     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM
+
+See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
+`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
+need to know the host type.
+
+   If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also
+use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
+produce code for and the `--build=TYPE' option to select the type of
+system on which you are compiling the package.
+
+Sharing Defaults
+================
+
+   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
+you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
+default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
+`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
+`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
+`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
+A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.
+
+Operation Controls
+==================
+
+   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
+operates.
+
+`--cache-file=FILE'
+     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
+     `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for
+     debugging `configure'.
+
+`--help'
+     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.
+
+`--quiet'
+`--silent'
+`-q'
+     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.
+
+`--srcdir=DIR'
+     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
+     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.
+
+`--version'
+     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
+     script, and exit.
+
+`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.
