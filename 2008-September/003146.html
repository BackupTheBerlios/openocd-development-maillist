<PRE>There are 2 things in the attached patch that should help determine what
is going wrong.

(A) IAR has a problem with 'O' packets larger then 99 bytes
new GDB command to help work around that, see below.

(B) In the &quot;arm7_9&quot; debug section, I added some LOG_DEBUG() messages
It seems there was little to *NONE* in that section of code.
Hence, it is very hard to trace problems.
See attached patch.

There is no reason the attached patch should not be committed.

--Duane.

=========================================

simony&gt; IAR Embeded Workbench for ARM 5.11 doesn't have GDB console output.

I have this initial problem:

IAR kick start (32k version) chokes on large O packets.

I have a fix [see attached patch]

In this new patch, There is a new command:

&gt;<i> gdb configure -max-O-packet 0
</I>
Above is -max-(letter-O)-packet, not '-max-(number-ZERO)-packet.

The value 0 (zero) - disables all O (letter Oh) packets.
Default is now '256'

They seem to have a *STUPID* limit of exactly 99 bytes.
This works:
&gt;<i> gdb configure -max-O-packet 99
</I>This fails
&gt;<i> gdb configure -max-O-packet 100
</I>
How much you wanna bet somebody @ IAR hard coded 100 somewhere?

======================================
Continuing.... with your original problem.

&gt;&gt;<i> Error: unknown character 0x24 in reply, dropping connection
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Warning:ignoring character 0x6d
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Warning:ignoring character 0x31
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Warning:ignoring character 0x2c
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Warning:ignoring character 0x31
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Warning:ignoring character 0x23
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Warning:ignoring character 0x66
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Warning:ignoring character 0x62
</I>
That translates to: $m1,1#fa

Which means: Read @ address 1, for 1 byte.

Openocd should not have a problem with that command.

However, I can't tell which of the two locations in 'gdb_server.c' this
is coming from. There are two identical error messages :-(

[NOT any more, my attached patch changes that]

I cannot get my instance to fail like you are having it fail. Perhaps it
is something specific to your code, or maybe your target.

Anyway - I suspect - I cannot confirm - that in this exactly place, IAR
has sent a 'm' packet. And OpenOCD is not expecting one... it is
expecting an ACK or NAK only.

My attached patch then tries to &quot;unget&quot; the 0x24 ($) start of packet and
assumes the packet waiting for the ACK is good, and does an &quot;unget&quot; so
the main packet decoder can find the new packet. (The other 'ignoring'
messages are coming from the main packet decoder)

I suspect IAR - gets no reply and dies a horrible death.

======================================
You are talking about BREAKPOINTS and STEPPING - etc.

I don't have an NXP LPC chip, I have atmel stuff.
I don't have problems you are having.

But - perhaps the additional log messages [in the patch] will help
narrow the problem.

======================================
**END**
