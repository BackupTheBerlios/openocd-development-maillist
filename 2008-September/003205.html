</I>Yes, it is quite easy. Set a HARDWARE instruction break point at that 
address, and RUN.

Note the difference - I said an instruction hardware break point - not 
soft break point, and not read or write break point.

Depending on your OS - it may need to *LOAD* the application into 
memory. Often a &quot;write breakpoint&quot; would happen application is loaded 
from FLASH, or from TFTP etc.

Also note: Depending on your OS - if it supports &quot;demand page virtual 
memory&quot; (ones I have been involved with did) you often require an OS 
hack that forces the application to be resident in memory, otherwise GDB 
tries to set a break point on an non-resident memory location and 
faults. Yuck.

BTW - this also lets you run &amp; debug other operating systems like the 
linux kernel - that you TFTP boot because it takes too damn long to JTAG 
a 1MEG operating system image into memory.
