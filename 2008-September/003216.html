I believe you understand the basic idea, let me explain a bit more.

FIXED LOCATION SOLUTION

(A) Some operating systems - have a *FIXED* location for a few
functions. For example - if you TFTP boot your file across the network,
the file is always loaded at the *exact same* address, for example linux
kernel entry point is always a fixed address you might set the break
point at that location.

VARIABLE LOCATION SOLUTION

(B) You can - via &quot;NM&quot; and/or other 'binutils' program to find a special
&quot;_known_good_symbol_&quot; from your existing ELF executable program. Do that
inside your Makefile. Inside that same makefile - you can create a tiny
&quot;.gdbinit&quot; script that sets the hardware break point at the correct
address. Or maybe something that another GDB script will &quot;source&quot;

TRIGGER LOCATION SOLUTION

(C) Perhaps your chip has a FLASH rom that performs the boot operation.
You can modify your code so that right *AFTER* it initializes the MMU -
it *WRITES* a value to the boot rom. Of course, the boot rom will ignore
the write operation :-) - but - the address is a *FIXED* address, that
you can easily *HARD*CODE*.

DEBUG_printf(&quot;Turning The MMU on\n&quot;);
turn_mmu_on();
DEBUG_printf(&quot;Triggering GDB...\n&quot;);
#define BOOT_ROM_ADDRESS 0x01000000
*((int *)(BOOT_ROM_ADDRESS)) = 0xdeadbeef;

(E) The advantage of (D) is you can leave this &quot;ignored write&quot; in place.
And ... periodically write to *OTHER* addresses in the boot rom
Each different address is a *SPECIFIC* area in your program you want to
debug.

For example,
1) the Operating system loads by TFTP BOOT.
2) Various user applications get loaded and run
3) A driver gets loaded by an application
4) A user program starts
5) User program opens the driver.
6) User program *MAPS* the 'boot rom' as read/write
7) User program *WRITES* to a different address in boot rom
* GDB is triggered.

Or maybe - the user program calls the driver
The driver prints the &quot;driver load address&quot;
(so you can use &quot;symbol file...&quot;)
Then the driver *WRITES* to different address in boot rom.
* GDB is triggered

I have done all of the above with great success!

Hardware breakpoints are *powerful* features :-)

-Duane.
