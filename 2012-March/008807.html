<PRE>change.

For Linux, libusb 1.0 is not API compatible with libusb-0.1.

&gt;<i> Not sure if I understood you correctly here - the HID backend is for
</I>&gt;<i> HID-class devices, right? Specifically it is not for the FTDI chips?
</I>
Right. It is not for FTDI chips.

&gt;<i> &gt; o the WinUSB backend brings a WHQL signed driver, which is good, because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it runs on all windows versions that required signed drivers (Vista
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 64-bit, Windows 7)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; o The WinUSB How-To says that you need to get the whole driver package
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; including the .inf file signed. Some postings to newsgroups suggest that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this is not necessary. It might be that you get a warning, which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; shouldn't be that much of a problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is ok to load the driver even though there is a warning.
</I>
Yes. I do not have XP/Vista 64 but the reports confirms this.

&gt;&gt;<i> You can do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the same with libusb-win32 device driver if somebody can pay the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> digital signature (not so expensive). One company already got their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> libusb-win32 based device driver certified by WHQL but they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> renamed all the driver name to their own name.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You seem to know the signature and WHQL stuff. As I understand it there are
</I>&gt;<i> at least two issues:
</I>&gt;<i> - WHQL certification for the driver (.sys)
</I>&gt;<i> - Signature for the driver package (.cab), including the .inf file that will
</I>&gt;<i> need to be modified whenever we add a new VID/PID
</I>
Rather:
1) KMCS digital signature of the core driver
2) WHQL of the driver package (including the INF file)

The WIndows built-in WinUSB and usbser.sys are examples of 1.
You still need an INF file to load the driver. You still need to submit
the packages for WHQL.

&gt;<i> I'm not sure if WHQL certification and the driver signature are the same
</I>&gt;<i> thing?
</I>
They are not.

&gt;<i> Does digital signature mean for example a VeriSign issued signature? Would
</I>&gt;<i> Windows accept self-signed signatures? Can we create root certificates of
</I>&gt;<i> our own for this purpose?
</I>
VeriSign is once of them.
You can use only a few CAs -- you have to pay.

&gt;<i> I dislike the idea of paying for any of this because because some of these
</I>&gt;<i> costs might be recurring (digital signatures might expire?), and because it
</I>&gt;<i> would mean the project would have to cover costs for mostly commercial
</I>&gt;<i> dongles.
</I>
It is said that you need to get the digital signature only once. This is good
for libusb-win32 and many projects which use libusb-win32.

WinUSB does not have this problem.

&gt;&gt;<i> Based on my experiences it is quite good. The filter driver can cause
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> many problems (including serious BSOD and lost of all USB device)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and is no longer recommended by the author. The device driver has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> never caused problem for me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The advantage of the filter driver is that it runs in parallel with other
</I>&gt;<i> installed drivers, e.g. FTDI's D2XX, right?
</I>
Yes. But it is more difficult to get a proper filter driver.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; o (Re-)writing libftdi with plain WinUSB should be possible and would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; remove the uncertainties of libusb-win32, but would burden the OpenOCD
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; project with the task of keeping it stable and up to date. It would also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; leave out Windows 2000 and before.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You can always use libusb-win32+libftdi for Windows 2k.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having to maintain multiple different Windows drivers puts a pretty heavy
</I>&gt;<i> burden on the Windows packagers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Maybe not that bad if a proper package can be created to give the user
a selection.

Hope this helps.
