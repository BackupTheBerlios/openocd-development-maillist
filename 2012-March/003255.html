<PRE>If we have the infrastructure to run such code (ie. the openocd side, which takes a pointer/filename for such a codelet, plus the target-specific startup code), we can easily download as many of those codelets to target RAM as space permits - but if space is tight, only the last downloaded part will be in target memory, which will probably still be fine when writing a big block of data to flash.


Now the question is: can we generate position-independent code using gcc on all platforms?
If not, I see two possibilities:
 - write the target code in assembly for each platform where gcc can not produce position-independent code. Using the C code (or the compiler's assembler output) as a start, this should not be too much trouble, but it is work that needs to be done for each (new) platform nevertheless.

 - generate versions of the target code for a specific load address, and only load it there - if the user needs a different load address, he needs to re-run make to generate code versions for the new address. This is really ugly IMHO, but should work without much effort, and I would guess that for each CPU, one or two code addresses should be sufficient.

 - fixup/relocate the code for the target address where it is used. That way, we only need the startup code for each target, and we can use exactly the same C code for all target-running code on all platforms. I have no idea how much work this would be - can the existing ELF loader in openocd be used to load &amp; relocate the target code? An alternative would be to add a simple relocation array somewhere to the binary blob with the target code, which means adding some header, too, so this basically means inventing our own executable file format.
