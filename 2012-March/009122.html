<PRE>V8 is using AT91SAM7S256. V6/V7 is using AT91SAM7S64.
Improved SWD using interface chip (V6/V7 from GPIO).
Better SWD support.
3 LED indicators instead of one. One for USB Communication;
one for target CPU reset status, one for 5V output.

Is this in line with your SAM-ICE?

There there is the new J-Link Pro which adds Ethernet interface
in addition to the USB interface. It is said that it is using
AT91SAM7X256.
<A HREF="http://www.segger.com/jlink.html">http://www.segger.com/jlink.html</A>

&gt;<i> When I execute openocd, approximately
</I>&gt;<i> every third attempt causes a complete communication failure, the green li=
</I>ght
&gt;<i> on the SAM-ICE extinguishes for about three seconds (internal watchdog
</I>&gt;<i> timeout in the dongle?), flickers a few times, and then resumes a solid
</I>&gt;<i> illumination. =A0The console displays the following messages during the e=
</I>vent
&gt;<i> and the debugger is left unusable afterwards:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> =A0 =A0Jupiter:Embedded garycarlson$ openocd-jlink -f
</I>&gt;<i> =A0 =A0/usr/local/openocd-config/interface/jlink.cfg -f
</I>&gt;<i> =A0 =A0/usr/local/openocd-config/target/at91sam9260.cfg
</I>&gt;<i> =A0 =A0.
</I>&gt;<i> =A0 =A0.
</I>&gt;<i> =A0 =A0.
</I>&gt;<i> =A0 =A0Error: J-Link command EMU_CMD_VERSION failed (-60)
</I>&gt;<i> =A0 =A0Error: J-Link command EMU_CMD_VERSION failed (-1)
</I>&gt;<i> =A0 =A0Error: J-Link command EMU_CMD_VERSION failed (-32)
</I>
This &quot;EMU_CMD_VERSION failed&quot; happens very often with
V3/V6/V7.

&gt;<i> =A0 =A0Info : J-Link initial read failed, don't worry
</I>&gt;<i> =A0 =A0Info : J-Link JTAG Interface ready
</I>&gt;<i> =A0 =A0Error: usb_bulk_read failed (requested=3D1, result=3D-32)
</I>&gt;<i> =A0 =A0Error: jlink_tap_execute, wrong result -107 (expected 1)
</I>&gt;<i> =A0 =A0Error: usb_bulk_read failed (requested=3D1, result=3D-32)
</I>&gt;<i> =A0 =A0.
</I>
This happens from time to time.

&gt;<i> Based on the j-link code written by the original author, I suspect he may
</I>&gt;<i> have experienced the same or a similar problem. =A0The code has a while l=
</I>oop
&gt;<i> and three retries in the jlink_init function to get communication to work
</I>&gt;<i> with the dongle. =A0The first version patch I submitted yesterday has
</I>&gt;<i> decreased the statistical startup failure rate in my case from 43% to 2%,
</I>&gt;<i> but has not completely eliminated the problem.
</I>
It does not help me for the V3 and V7 I tried. Strangely the Linux distros
play a part as well. It seems to be more stable under Ubuntu 9.04 than
Arch Linux.

&gt;<i> Unfortunately I only have one j-link device with one particular board. =
</I>=A0What
&gt;<i> I am hoping to find is some other people who use the j-link device with
</I>&gt;<i> other CPUs that have also experienced the problem and are willing to test
</I>&gt;<i> this patch and a possible revised patch prior to making a final commitmen=
</I>t
&gt;<i> decision. =A0What I don't want to do is break it for someone else through
</I>&gt;<i> unintended consequences.
</I>
It does not help. It does not make things worse either.

&gt;<i> The second version of this patch that I am working on will hopefully redu=
</I>ce
&gt;<i> the failure rate from 2% to zero. =A0I will try to get that out either to=
</I>day
&gt;<i> or tomorrow if my own testing proves fruitful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I can test that.
