<PRE>I made it a little bit further.  One issue is most PXA270 systems are
designed such that SRST shuts down most of power supplies to the chip.
 If I changed the sequence such that SRST is de-asserted before the
first xscale_write_dcsr() call, then it gets a little further.
Perhaps the hardware that contains the dcsr is powered by a supply
that is typically powered down during system reset.  There probably
also needs to be a configurable delay between deasserting SRST and any
jtag activity.  However, it still does not seem to work as I can't get
the processor halted (see log below).  Config file is attached.

Does this all make sense?  Any suggestions how to proceed from here?
The target hardware works fine with a commercial JTAG debugger.

Thanks,
Cliff
