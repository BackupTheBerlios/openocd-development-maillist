<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;/ Hello David,
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ I am not so sure about this. Still smells like reset problem to me.
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ It should be noted that when I let small bootloader execute from the
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ SPI flash and do the reset (and some other config), I can attach  with
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ OpenOCD, i.e. chain is well scanned. I was able after attachment to
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ set-up SDRAM and launch eCos application (which would further
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ configure SoC). Now I erased the flash and tried without bootloader. I
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ do not exactly know what bootloader is doing (have not insight in the
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ code yet), but obviously nothing expect reset is needed for a proper
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ chain scanning.
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ It should be also noted that Lauterbach jtag attaches without any
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ problems. I do not think that it does anything special for this step.
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ All what is needed after is few lines of SDRAM set-up and application
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ can be uploaded and run. But that comes after attachment (as for
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ OpenOCD).
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ All this confirms that hardware is working properly. I am almost
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ convinced that bug is either on OpenOCD side (I tried with both ftd
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ libs) or I should configure reset in some special way...
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ Would anybody have some hints after these additional explanations ?
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ Best regards,
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ Drasko
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/   
</I>&gt;<i> /It is not coming from your JTAGkey-2 since you can scan and detect the 
</I>&gt;<i> chain after configuration of your system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is really somewhere in the OpenOCD .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But you could try to disable the use of RTCK feature from the Amontec 
</I>&gt;<i> JTAGkey-2 and run at a super low frequency before doing your scan chain 
</I>&gt;<i> detection.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, could you please try to disconnect the JTAGkey from USB port 
</I>&gt;<i> before doing this. OpenOCD is still not really clean regarding the 
</I>&gt;<i> finish using the Amontec JTAGey as other FT2232 USB JTAG dongle before 
</I>&gt;<i> closing its handle in mpsse mode.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The sequence before closing the JTAGkey as other FT2232 USB JTAG dongle 
</I>&gt;<i> should be :
</I>&gt;<i> - 1. place all pin as input
</I>&gt;<i> - 2. quit the mppse bitbang mode
</I>&gt;<i> - 3. close the handle
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> CLEAN AFTER COMING :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the 1. and 2. are NOT DONE in the actual OpenOCD and it can make trouble 
</I>&gt;<i> when you close and re-open the openocd.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let us know the debug output in this case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Laurent

</I>&gt;<i> soon with SWD support )
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Before starting openocd with Amontec JTAGkey-2,
- the two Green LEDs should be 'ON'
- the Red LED should be 'OFF'
- the Yellow LED should be 'OFF'

(this is not the case after closing openocd and restarting openocd, 
since the openocd do not implement the 1. 2. as explained before )

The internal greenn LED comes 'ON' when the host computer enumerated the 
Amontec JTAGkey-2. OFF if in suspend mode.

The external greenn LED comes 'ON' if the Voltage target VREF is present 
and between 1.3V to 5.5V. OFF if no VREF or SUSPEND mode.

The red LED of the JTAGkey-2 and JTAGkey-2P let see the signal status of 
the TMS between the FT2232 and the UHS buffer.
(UHS buffer are 2x faster than LVTTL making the 30MHz possible on the 
JTAGkey-2 from 1.3V to 5.5V / tested on Xilinx spartan -3a )
'ON' if TMS from FT2232 driven to '0'

The yellow LED of the JTAGkey-2 and JTAGkey-2P let see if a output 
signal is active between the FT2232 the UHS buffer.
'ON' if any of TCK TMS TDI SRST TRST are driven by FT2232 to UHS buffer
'OFF' if all the TCK TMS TDI SRST TRST are not driven.
(The yellow is controled by all the output enable of each signal)

The LEDs on the Amontec JTAGkey-2 can serve to certify the state of the 
FT2232 before open the device in mode mpsse, and closing from the mpsse. 
This make the Amontec JTAGkey-2 and Amontec-2P unique !

Note: P of Amontec JTAGkey-2P is for voltage Pump on pin 19 of the 
20-pin connect. On Amontec JTAGkey-2P, the voltage Pump, called 
sometimes VPUMP, provides 3.3V @ 500mA on pin 19 .

Best regards,
Laurent
