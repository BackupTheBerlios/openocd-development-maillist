<PRE>The STM32 parts have Flash beginning at 0x8000000, and OpenOCD's 
stm32x.c places the Flash there regardless of the address used in the 
&quot;flash&quot; command in the cfg file.

The chips have two pins that can be jumpered to specify what appears 
at address 0: Flash, RAM, or the boot loader.  For embedded work, I 
think &quot;Flash&quot; will be the most common case.

But if I link my program at zero, it is a pain to burn my program, 
because OpenOCD tells gdb there is only RAM at 0, with Flash at 8000000.

One solution is to re-link my program to 8000000, and rely on 
aliasing of the vector table to 0.  This works, but is a little annoying.

I would like to propose the following changes to allow Flash at zero:


1) In the file flash/stm32x.c, function stm32x_probe, remove or 
comment out the explicit setting of bank-&gt;base:
         // Don't fill in the base: get it from the cfg file
//      bank-&gt;base = 0x08000000;
         bank-&gt;size = (num_pages * page_size);
         (etc.)

2) In the stm32.cfg, change
         flash bank $_FLASHNAME stm32x 0 0 0 0 $_TARGETNAME
to
         flash bank $_FLASHNAME.1 stm32x 0x00000000 0 0 0 $_TARGETNAME
         flash bank $_FLASHNAME.2 stm32x 0x08000000 0 0 0 $_TARGETNAME

This claims that there are TWO Flash banks, one at 0 and one at 
8000000.  By having two banks, users can locate their code at either 
location, as they prefer, without needing to modify the cfg file.

Note that this would break existing cfg files, moving the Flash from 
8000000 to 0.  This could be remedied by using a non-zero value for 
one of the other parameters (bus width etc) to mean &quot;new style&quot;, and 
only using the specified base address in that case.  (Or more 
formally, one might add a new &quot;algorithm&quot; instead of stm32x that does this)

What do people think?
