OK, writing previous e-mail, one thing crossed my mind : I was (and
probably NIved also) putting breakppoints before starting a program,
which in my case is e-Cos application.
As e-Cos will initialize caches during the boot, bkpt instruction
placed by the GDB in RAM will be replicated to the cache. But I never
before did try to start e-Cos, stop it via GDB and place a SW
breakpoint. This way, if it is really a cache problem, bkpt
instruction will be placed in memory, but not replicated in cache and
thus never seen when we do 'c'. And that is exactly what happens in my
case  - program never stops after.

So, this can prove two things :
1)  Problem comes from cache inconsistency.
2) My routines for cache flushing :

printf (&quot;Invalidate I$\n&quot;);
retval = arm966e_write_cp15(target, 0x0f, 0);

printf (&quot;Invalidate D$\n&quot;);
retval = arm966e_write_cp15(target, 0x0e, 0);

are not good.

My question is here can anybody, based on ARM946E doc given here :
<A HREF="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.set.arm9/index.html">http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.set.arm9/index.html</A>
can give me valid parameters to write into CP15 with
arm966e_write_cp15() function in order to flush I$, because I can not
see what is wrong with the lines I came up with...


Nived,
as Mike pointed out you probably took old code without cache-handling patch.

Can you also try to run your program without any breakpoint set, than
stop it with CTRL+C, and then set breakpoint to some instruction that
is after the address at which you stopped (yet to come in program
execution flow), and continue execution (by putting 'c' in GDB). If it
is a cache problem it will never stop on this new breakpoint.

Best regards,
Drasko
