This is a good initiative, but I think it's important to consider the
different components involved.

I like your goal, but I don't think OpenOCD should be working around
the behavior of gdb, or even higher level tools. Better just fix gdb
or the other tools.

Does the gdb load command (with or without parameters) always send an
address to OpenOCD?

If so, then gdb obviously also needs to know the address it should
send. That could come from the user, from another tool, or from the
binary. Adding an alias to OpenOCD isn't the right fix to the problem
of users or tools interfacing with gdb but not telling gdb the whole
story IMO.
