Precisely. And reporting and explaining the error *only*
where it arises is part of that centralization.

Occasionally there are some messages that elaborate on
the contact that check retval != ERROR_OK =&gt; &quot;while loading&quot;
or some such.

&gt;&gt;<i> Much less error prone, the error propagation is less than 100%,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better info and less code.
</I>&gt;<i> Wouldn't it be a better goal to fix poor coding practices (not propagating
</I>&gt;<i> errors) than to just work around them?
</I>
We do that too. Relying on the actual values is another bad coding
practice that we're getting rid of.

&gt;<i> &#160;And is it less code if a few lines are
</I>&gt;<i> eliminated from breakpoints.c, but every target checks the return code itself
</I>&gt;<i> and generates different messages that all say the same basic thing? &#160;This only
</I>&gt;<i> confuses the conversation.
</I>
Error messages are roughly modeled on exceptions. The right place
to throw an exception is where the exception occurs. Same thing in
OpenOCD. return retval != ERROR_OK and LOG_ERROR() at
the error site.

&gt;&gt;<i> To try to reconstruct some meaningful information about what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happened from a 32 bit value yields pretty nonsensical error
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> messages in general...
</I>&gt;<i> In general it can. &#160;If you generalize too much across disparate objects,
</I>&gt;<i> abstraction, inheritance, and all that becomes impractical and a numerical error
</I>&gt;<i> code loses meaning. &#160;But is that the case here? &#160;Looking at the error codes in
</I>&gt;<i> target.h, all seem rather specific and have the same meaning on all targets.
</I>&gt;<i> Probably the most vague is RESOURCE_NOT_AVAILABLE, but it's enough to let a user
</I>&gt;<i> know that if he wants another wp or hw bp, he needs to remove an existing one.
</I>&gt;<i> (And currently some of the targets do log their own error in this case: &quot;no free
</I>&gt;<i> breakpoint reg&quot;, &quot;can't find an available comparator&quot;, etc).
</I>
The different ERROR_ messages in OpenOCD pretty much reported willy-nilly.

Checking for a specific ERROR_ message is like catching a specific
exception. That specific ERROR_ message needs to be part of
the *documented* API. The number of places in OpenOCD where
code executes different code paths based on specific error messages
are less than a dozen and any time I encounter one, I usually find that
it can be eliminated.

&gt;<i> Amyway, that's my two cents. &#160;Wasn't thinking these deep thoughts when I
</I>&gt;<i> submitted the patch :-) &#160;Just trying to fit xcale changes into the broader
</I>&gt;<i> framework.
</I>
We've been deleting this sort of code problem from OpenOCD for a while,
but this is a case that we didn't get around to yet.

Will you resubmit patch with checking on specific error messages removed?

I can do it, but the advantage of you doing it is obviously that you
are currently testing those patches...
