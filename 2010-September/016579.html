I just might, but libusb-1.0 Windows support is blocking that in my
thinking.

Except that there's stuff in the code too.

Nod, I got that.

Yes, that is true.


&gt;<i> And i an not sure of the status of the win32 backend for libusb-1.0.
</I>
A lot of code has been written and it works. Some is already in
libusb.git, but more needs to be done. There are very full-featured
binaries from the main development repo libusb-pbatard.git, they
should be working quite well, but all that code hasn't yet made it to
libusb.git and unfortunately that process is far from a simple matter
of applying patches. There's also some unrelated work which should go
into the mix, such as support for the libusb-win32 kernel driver.

Hence, Real Soon Now. :)
