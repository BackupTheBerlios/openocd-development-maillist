</I>Yes, not hitting breakpoint can make one suspect on caches, i.e.
breakpoint was put in RAM, but not replicated in cache.
Here we are facing different behavior : breakpoint is always hit, no
mater at which instruction it is put.

</I>I am thinking the same - not a cache issue, but breakpoint
management/single stepping bug. I also said that it might have
something to do with interrupt handling, having in mind of SIGINT
involved in a SW breakpoint mechanism...

Best regards,
