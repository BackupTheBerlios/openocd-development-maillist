&#216;yvind,
Thank you very much for these answers. I took a look at code and I can
see that arm966e.c code uses :
.write_memory = arm7_9_write_memory

which writes only in physical memory,

while arm920t.c uses :
.write_memory = arm920t_write_memory

which in addition handles the caches (by draining/flushing them).

I still have one confusion, though. I can understand that breakpoint
rests in cache and that it can not be deleted and will be hit upon
next passage. But why it prevents me stepping on ? Any &quot;n&quot;, &quot;s&quot; or &quot;c&quot;
ends in hitting the same breakpoint immediately. Same with augmenting
pc reg for 1 and continuing.

This problem resemble one described here :
<A HREF="http://forum.sparkfun.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;t=22578">http://forum.sparkfun.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;t=22578</A>
but the solution with patching arm7_9-&gt;has_single_step does not work
for me - still the same breakpoint is hit.

Do you have any idea if this is due some other problem, or still to
the &quot;cache issue&quot; mentioned before ?

BR,
Drasko
