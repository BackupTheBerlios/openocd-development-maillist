<PRE>Hi,

I have been using software breakpoints to debug, i was using an older
version of OpenOCD and only recently upgraded to a higher version. I can
confirm that the issue exists for software breakpoints, how do i check the
hardware breakpoints ?

Also i tried setting pc to a higher value, but it says there is no such
variable pc when i try setting it. Could you please explain how to do this
in a little more detail ?. I know this may not be effective but just want to
make sure i can go beyond this point.

Does deleting the break point after it hits work for you?

Thanks
Nived

</I>&gt;<i> Try it, maybe it will work for you. And might throw some light on the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Btw, in one of the mails in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the thread you mention that you used set $pc = $pc + 4 and it worked.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, when you receive SIGINT on a break point, and keep receiving it
</I>&gt;<i> with every next step, you can try to force your $pc over the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;breakpoint&quot; which replaced your instruction in the memory. I picked a
</I>&gt;<i> number of 4 bytes, supposing that the replacing instruction will take
</I>&gt;<i> a 4 bytes. But it can take 2 bytes (for example of ARM thumb mode).
</I>&gt;<i> You can not know, so you might be forcing your $pc over some important
</I>&gt;<i> instruction and so never executing them, probably leading to a crash
</I>&gt;<i> or wrong behavior.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would not call this a &quot;workaround&quot;. I just tried it to prove if
</I>&gt;<i> there is a trailing bkpt instruction that rests in the I$, because I
</I>&gt;<i> have no means to inspect cache contents at this point. I observed
</I>&gt;<i> memory by dumping it and I can clearly see that original instruction
</I>&gt;<i> is replaced correctly by GDB on deleting breakpoint.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, it is still a misery to me. You do not have to delete
</I>&gt;<i> breakpoint to step over it. Most of the time you would like to leave
</I>&gt;<i> it there, so it can be hit in the next pass. Why does it keep
</I>&gt;<i> receiving SIGINT over and over I have no idea, and I am seriously
</I>&gt;<i> suspecting wrong interrupt handling, but I still did not get any
</I>&gt;<i> confirmation on this from OpenOCD experts, nor did anyone pointed me
</I>&gt;<i> to the SW breakpoint handling routines in OpenOCD, so I can
</I>&gt;<i> investigate further.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just to make it clear, for me HW breakpoints work OK, as they do not
</I>&gt;<i> use same mechanism as SW breakpoints do. Do you confirm tat it is the
</I>&gt;<i> same for you ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards,
