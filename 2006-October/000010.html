<PRE>Hello Magnus,

</I>Thanks for noticing this, fixed.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Right, it's implementation defined when the breakpoints get set, that's why 
there are only add_bp/wp functions in the target interface. Other targets, 
like your cortex port, are free to set them whenever it's suitable for them.

&gt;<i> ----------

</I>&gt;<i> This terminates the program. I have found that calling ft2232_read again

</I>&gt;<i> Alternative, probably cleaner, is to check dw_bytes_read and retry until
</I>&gt;<i> timeout or complete in  BUILD_FT2232_FTD2XX section of  ft2232_read
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I'd go for the second solution, but I'm a bit unsure why the problem occurs at 
all. The FT_Read call should only return after all requested data has been 
read, or a timeout occured, and the timeouts are set to 5 seconds. I can't 
imagine any transaction taken more than that. When you experienced this 
problem, was there a huge delay (&gt;5s)?
Not checking the number of bytes returned is actually a regression that was 
introduced when I added the timeouts, before that, FT_OK wouldn't have been 
returned unless the transfer completed.
I'll fix this in the next commit.
