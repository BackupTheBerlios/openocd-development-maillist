<PRE>Hi

The target interface and behavior seen from, run_alorithm, gdb etc will 
be identical.
Since I have already coded and tested the stuff I will keep it for a 
while. The
structure is the same as for armv4_5 but the details in poll, resume, 
step, run_algorithm are
by necessity quite different anyway.

I looked at the TARGET_EVENTS_ and made up the follwing rules
TARGET_EVENT_HALTED : We call debug_entry() to save the state for the 
process beeing debugged
TARGET_EVENT_DEBUG_HALTED : If necessary read processor registers ( in 
run_algorithm )
TARGET_EVENT_RESUMED : Restore context, cached processor, irq state and 
enable breakpoints
TARGET_EVENT_DEBUG_RESUMED : Mark saved state as dirty, write initial 
values directly ( in run_algorithm )

I think this can coexist well with the armv4_5 codebase, if it gets ugly 
I'll have to rewrite it :)

The structure as it is now:

armv7m.c

Processor core, execution modes, registers and Thumb2. Core register 
cache, Gdb interface, run_algorithm.

Target: cortex_m3.c

Everyting that uses Cortex-M3 standard peripherials and memory mapped 
registers. Poll, Resume, Halt, Debug_entry. Reading and writing core 
registers using the memory mapped core debug registers. Break and 
watchpoints. NVIC, FPB, DWT, PBP, AHBAP

cortex_swjdp.c &#8211; The low level JTAG part of cortex_m3

JTAG interface to DP and AHBAP, implements JTAG_IR caching and DP_AP 
address, csw and tap caching.

Transaction handling to minimize USB bus delays

Flash: stellaris.c ( lm3sxxx.c ?? )

Flash writing for Stellaris , LumnaryMicro LM3Sxxx chips, clock register.




&gt;<i> Okay, I've had a look at the code, and I think changing this behaviour would 
</I>&gt;<i> require several changes to the current code, which I'd like to avoid, as I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't have enough time at the moment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are no interfaces in the armv4/5 layer that would give direct access to 
</I>&gt;<i> the core, without using the core cache, and all parts of the code make use of 
</I>&gt;<i> the current values from the register cache.
</I>&gt;<i> The curret behaviour has also the benefit of being able to use the same 
</I>&gt;<i> functions for resuming and debug-reentry after an algorithm run. This might 
</I>&gt;<i> not be necessary for the Cortex, but it makes life on the ARM7/9 a lot 
</I>&gt;<i> easier, so I'd like to keep that.
</I>&gt;<i> The only drawback is that I have to backup the registers in 
</I>&gt;<i> armv4_5_run_algorithm, and restore them when the algorithm finished. I think 
</I>&gt;<i> catching debug execution in debug-resume and debug-reentry would be no 
</I>&gt;<i> less &quot;hacky&quot; than the current approach.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you know if there's already documentation for profiles other than -M 
</I>&gt;<i> available? Currently, I have the CortexM_TRM, 
</I>&gt;<i> DDI0405A_arm_v7m_AppLevel_beta01 and 
</I>&gt;<i> DDI0314C3_coresight_dk_r1p09_trm_extract, but nothing for the -A and -R 
</I>&gt;<i> profiles.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Thats exactly the same documentation I use apart from the Luminary Micro 
doc's.
I have seen nothing about the other profiles.
