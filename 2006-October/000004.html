Okay, I've had a look at the code, and I think changing this behaviour would 
require several changes to the current code, which I'd like to avoid, as I 
don't have enough time at the moment.

There are no interfaces in the armv4/5 layer that would give direct access to 
the core, without using the core cache, and all parts of the code make use of 
the current values from the register cache.
The curret behaviour has also the benefit of being able to use the same 
functions for resuming and debug-reentry after an algorithm run. This might 
not be necessary for the Cortex, but it makes life on the ARM7/9 a lot 
easier, so I'd like to keep that.
The only drawback is that I have to backup the registers in 
armv4_5_run_algorithm, and restore them when the algorithm finished. I think 
catching debug execution in debug-resume and debug-reentry would be no 
less &quot;hacky&quot; than the current approach.

Do you know if there's already documentation for profiles other than -M 
available? Currently, I have the CortexM_TRM, 
DDI0405A_arm_v7m_AppLevel_beta01 and 
DDI0314C3_coresight_dk_r1p09_trm_extract, but nothing for the -A and -R 
profiles.

Best regards,

Dominic
