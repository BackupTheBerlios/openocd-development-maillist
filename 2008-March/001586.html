While this is true at the moment, the number of parallel ports in 
devices around us is plummeting. Also, the bit-bang parallel port 
control is not (and has never been) well-documented and it varies widely 
across platforms.

Linux has a decent way of controlling the parport. Windows allows it, 
even though you'll have to fiddle with giveio.sys and things are 
becoming increasingly difficult with tighter security, x86, etc. OS X or 
Apple hardware has no clue about the parallel port, as Mr. Jobs has 
deemed it evil decades ago.

Many laptops don't have parallel ports, and parallel ports will 
inevitably disappear from desktop hardware within the next few years. 
And if we think of all sorts of handheld devices with USB OTG (such as 
Nokia N810), USB seems to have a very strong position. (AFAIK, no one 
has ported OpenOCD to maemo, but it might just be possible.)

USB hardware is not very expensive, either. For DIY people there are 
solutions starting from around $20, and readymade dongles can be 
obtained for $60 (40 euros). That should not be a prohibitively high 
cost even for a hobbyist, even though it is much more than the $1 
required for a parallel port dongle.

So, if we look at the scene today, it might be that most people use 
parallel port adapters. But if we take a glimpse into the crystal ball, 
there will be very few hints towards parallel port devices. USB is the 
only (relatively) safe bet right now.

The bad thing here is that USB requires intelligence in the dongle 
itself, as bit-banging is very slow if wone one bit at a time. This 
problem has no easy solution apart from trying to keep the HW driver 
interface as simple as possible. My hunch is that FT2232 is the most 
important USB interface at the moment.
