Agreed. Disabled code should use #if 0, especially since that can be easily 
enabled and disabled. It certainly shouldn't nest comments.

Oh please...

&gt;<i> Code readability comes from well-structured coding not from rigid

</I>
Rigid enforcement? I guess you haven't seen rigid enforcement yet. There are 
projects where any submission that doesn't exactly follow the coding style 
has no way of moving into mainline. I've seen people submitting the same 
patchset four or five times until every requirement of the coding standards 
was fulfilled.

&gt;<i> Code readability also comes from proper documentation. For example
</I>&gt;<i> target_state is lacking a proper description of its semantics.
</I>
Well, feel free to document it, and ask, if something is unclear:

TARGET_UNKNOWN = 0: we don't know anything about the target yet
TARGET_RUNNING = 1: the target is executing user code
TARGET_HALTED  = 2: the target is not executing code, and ready to talk to the 
debugger. on an xscale it means that the debug handler is executing
TARGET_RESET   = 3: the target is being held in reset (only a temporary state, 
not sure how this is used with all the recent changes)
TARGET_DEBUG_RUNNING = 4: the target is running, but it is executing code on 
behalf of the debugger (e.g. algorithm for flashing)

&gt;<i> But hey, at least the comments are properly formatted and coding guidelines 
</I>&gt;<i> are included in the README :( 
</I>
Please, get over this. No, your code doesn't have to compile with the -ansi 
switch, because none of the code does. Yes, your code may use gcc-specific or 
c99 constructs, because the other code does as well. No, you must not use 
C++, or emulate C++ using funny defines. No, you may not use C++ style 
comments, because none of the other code does, or should do. Code mixing two 
comment styles /is/ more difficult to read. Try using #if 0 to comment out 
unused sections of the code. They're easy to spot in most editors, can be 
enabled and disabled easily, and don't interfere with the style guidelines.

Really, your contribution is highly appreciated, but arguing about a very 
simple set of rules is causing some grief of my side, and I guess on yours as 
well.

Best regards,

Dominic
