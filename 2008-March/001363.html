Zero would _unintentionally_ be the &quot;correct&quot; value in most cases, and thus 
the problem would go unrecognized until the first user has his XScale as the 
second device in a chain. At that point the code could fail, or produce 
random results, depending on how the first device in the chain reacts upon 
the JTAG data meant for the XScale.

If the value is left uninitialized all the developer has to do is run valgrind 
(or a similar tool, IIRC Spen talked about something for windows), and he'll 
get an error listed - a meaningful error, telling him where uninitialized 
memory was accessed, how he got there, and who allocated that memory.

&gt;<i> That beats  *hoping* that a somewhat random value will yield a
</I>&gt;<i> detectable problem when the code path is exercised on a
</I>&gt;<i> developer machine. The real *nasty* problems are when
</I>&gt;<i> the somewhat random value mostly results in the correct

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If this doesn't convince you, then I don't know what will. :-)
</I>
These are different goals - you want something that just works most of the 
time, I want the code to be correct. Correctness can't be achieved by 
initializing to zero no matter what the values within those structures mean. 
It can be achieved by leaving them uninitialized, in the hope for a developer 
running the available tools on the search for bugs.

Best regards,

Dominic
