OpenOCD on XScale had only few users (it still has), and the only XScale 
target I ever had was severly limited, so I didn't bother working on the 
XScale support soon after it worked for the first time. I don't think I ever 
ran a valgrind session when using a XScale target. I'm currently looking for 
a NSLU2, preferably bricked *grin*, to have at least one target to test with.

I didn't run the OpenOCD very often at all during the last months, and thus 
haven't run a Valgrind session at all, but it's certainly the right thing 
(tm) to detect uninitialized memory rather than blindly initializing 
everything to zero.

I'll revert your patch locally and run a valgrind session on ARM7TDMI and 
ARM926EJ-S, would be nice if you could let us know what the culprit with 
XScale was.

Regards,

Dominic
