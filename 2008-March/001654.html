<PRE>The whole store below makes me want to insist that xsvf/xilinx uses
pathmoves and making a transition to the current state a no-op.

It removes all ambiguity and forces xsvf/xilinx support to sort out,
from the specifications, what sort of transitions that are required.

It's testing hell otherwise w.r.t. making this work across implementations
of jtag devices/interfaces.

In fact, I'm tempted to *remove* jtag_add_statemove() entirely and add
a new jtag_add_trst().

Anyone who wants anything but end stats would then *have* to use
jtag_add_pathmove().

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; Please elaborate on what &quot;standard&quot; path means. Which standard?

</I>&gt;<i>  SVF. I've got a paper, which says:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Serial Vector Format Specification&quot;, Asset IInterTech Inc., Revision E
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  (<A HREF="http://asset-intertech.com/support/svf.pdf">http://asset-intertech.com/support/svf.pdf</A>)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  AFAIK, this is The SVF Standard. It specifies the standard paths at the
</I>&gt;<i>  description of &quot;STATE&quot; command.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Most of the time SVF and XSVF behave similarily (apart form the fact
</I>&gt;<i>  that XSVF leaves a few unnecessary things out). However, I was
</I>&gt;<i>  completely wrong when I commented on the state move, because here we
</I>&gt;<i>  have a difference between XSVF XSTATE and SVF STATE commands:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   XSTATE S (when we are at S): do nothing
</I>&gt;<i>   STATE S (when we are at S): run through the loop
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  So, your approach is right with XSVF, but with SVF it would be wrong.
</I>&gt;<i>  (Interestingly, this may be the reason why some SVF files do not work
</I>&gt;<i>  after being translated into XSVF.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  ---
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  The paths between stable states (&quot;standard paths&quot;) are in XSVF specified
</I>&gt;<i>  as follows:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;For special states known as stable states (Test-Logic-Reset,
</I>&gt;<i>  Run-Test/Idle, Pause-DR, Pause-IR), an XSVF interpreter follows
</I>&gt;<i>  predefined TAP state paths when the starting state is a stable
</I>&gt;<i>  state and when the XSTATE specifies a new stable state (see the STATE
</I>&gt;<i>  command in the [Ref 5] for the TAP state paths between stable states).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  For non-stable states, XSTATE should specify a state that is only one
</I>&gt;<i>  TAP state transition distance from the current TAP state to avoid
</I>&gt;<i>  undefined TAP state paths. A sequence of multiple XSTATE commands can be
</I>&gt;<i>  issued to transition the TAP through a specific state path.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  ([Ref 5] is the SVF standard.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  This, on the other hand, is contradictory to what Dominic has chosen to
</I>&gt;<i>  do. I do not know if there are any ill effects in using the 7-step
</I>&gt;<i>  paths, but it is hard to rule out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I took a look into this when I was trying to figure out why my XSVF
</I>&gt;<i>  files did not work. I got the impression that with SVF and XSVF the
</I>&gt;<i>  paths should always be defined explicitly step-by-step to avoid
</I>&gt;<i>  problems. There is no guarantee that Dominic's standard paths are the
</I>&gt;<i>  same as SVF standard paths.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I am not saying Dominic's approach is wrong. It isn't, as it complies to
</I>&gt;<i>  the JTAG standard AND solves some programmer-specific problems. But here
</I>&gt;<i>  it is incompatible with (X)SVF.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  ---
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Oh, another thing which might interest you. I have written a SVF
</I>&gt;<i>  interpreter, which implements everything else except for the PIOMAP and
</I>&gt;<i>  PIO commands. It is written so that it should be easy to interface to
</I>&gt;<i>  OpenOCD, but I have not had the time to do it. The interpreter has been
</I>&gt;<i>  tested with some real files, and it seems to parse the files correctly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I was just thinking you are rather familiar with the innards of OpenOCD.
</I>&gt;<i>  And as you are also familiar with the XSVF module, it might be easier
</I>&gt;<i>  for you than me to make the integration. Are you interested?
</I>
I'm interested, but I don't have the time :-)

If you make a try to convert it, I'll look it over and commit it.

My first order of the day would be to sort out the jtag_add_statemove() thing
though. Would you be interestedin rewriting xsvf / xilinx to use
jtag_add_pathmove()?'

This would allow me to retire jtag_add_statemove() which is a bottomless pit
of missery w.r.t. defining what it actually means.
