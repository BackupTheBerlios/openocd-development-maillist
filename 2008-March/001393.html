Programming flash memory as a batch job is a typical example.

</I>
*All* of these are executed during *config* stage, i.e. before reaching the initialization code
in the main().


&gt;<i> I hate the idea of an explicit command to do this, I can't imagine
</I>&gt;<i> that users will be able to sort this out.
</I>
Actually they don't have to. There will be still the implicit initialization
when all configuration scripts are processed. This is for advanced users.


&gt;<i> Seems like an internal issue to OpenOCD that OpenOCD should handle somehow.
</I>&gt;<i> Why is that OpenOCD, in principle, can't detect that &quot;configuration is over&quot;?
</I>
This is really by principle of the configuration scripts itself.
The configuration information is givent to OpenOCD it in multiple commands on multiple lines
and some parts of the initialization cannot be done until the information is complete.

OpenOCD simply cannot tell whether there will be more commands aggregating data needed for the initialization
before reaching the actual end of the configuration script(s).
It also cannot tell this by reaching a command which requires init to be already done as some of these commands
are even not registered in the config stage, thus they are completely unavailable (target specific commands, for example).

The only solution to automate this as much as possible is to do as much initialization as possible directly in
the command handlers during processing of the config scripts, however, some parts still cannot
be done without explicit command anyway, e.g. jtag chain has to be done after *all* &quot;jtag_device&quot;
commands be already processed.

The suggested approach would allow batch processing like
openocd -f at91sam7.cfg -c init -f flashing.script

I assume that the init command would typically be invoked from the command line rather than a script.
but it seems to me more clean (and much easier to implement) solution to implement it like a normal command,
rather than a command line switch.


&gt;<i> I'd like to see the telnet and gdb server running even if no contact
</I>&gt;<i> can be made with the target, that's vaguely related to this.
</I>
Actually, the proposal is not in conflict with this, however it alone does not solve it either.
I am not sure about GDB, but telnet, in principle, could run without the target.
This behavior would be really nice, but I don't think it can be easily implemented without breaking something right away.
Let's think about the &quot;init&quot; command is transitional, until we have a better solution (if we find a reasonable one).

Regards,
   Pavel
