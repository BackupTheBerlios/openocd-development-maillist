No problem with the telnet, but I am not sure about GDB.
OpenOCD supports multiple targets and it distinguishes between targets by TCP port number GDB connects to.
That is, unles a target is defined, OpenOCD does not listen on any port for incomming GDB connections in the present state.

I am not sure how to make GDB  available even without a target configured
so that it behaves logically. I suggest to take cautious steps in this, lets go just with the telnet first.


&gt;<i> The reason is that e.g. GDB init scripts can use monitor commands
</I>&gt;<i> to initialize the target.  This matches expectations of a lot of users
</I>&gt;<i> that have used other hardware debug solutions.
</I>
Although it does not seem so crucial me, it is probably a good to have this.


&gt;<i> Other advantages is that the target might only be powered up
</I>&gt;<i> after OpenOCD is up and running.
</I>
Well, probably not a big deal. The previous goal seems much more interesting to me.


&gt;<i> I'm hopeful that the ramifications won't be too severe.  I don't
</I>&gt;<i> expect any regressions/colateral damage.
</I>
Well, I am not absolutely sure about this, see above, at least it changes the logic
of behavior with multiple targets (?).


&gt;<i> Mostly it should
</I>&gt;<i> involve making OpenOCD more robust with flaky JTAG
</I>&gt;<i> connections.
</I>
That would be good ;-)

Regards,
   Pavel
