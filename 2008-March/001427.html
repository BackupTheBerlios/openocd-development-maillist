<PRE>I saw the commented out code.. It looks like you were trying to resolve the fact that the documentation says to write to a coprocessor register that doesnt exist (CR5, CR10).  I will see if my chip vendor can get clarification from ARM on this.  

The result that I was getting was that if I put a read of DSCR at the end of the memory accesses as recommended, the reads of addresses that didnt have imprecise data aborts would subsequently work.  With out this, nothing ever works again without resetting.  I think that it is important to &quot;drain the write buffer&quot;, which should remove the need for the read of DSCR, but who can tell?  I will work through it here to see what I can make work.

Since your priority is not on flash programming, I will go ahead and try to get it working. It appears as though the stubbed out run_algorithm() method is the first issue.  Do you know of others?

Mark.

I found these manuals very frustrating. Other than the samples there 
seems to be no clear explanation of the mechanism. And the samples have 
some obvious errors so they should probably be taken with a grain of 
salt too. I came to the same conclusion as you first and then found 
through trial&amp;error that the repeated RTI really is needed.

&gt;<i> (or at least clarify this).  The problem that I WAS having, was that
</I>&gt;<i> I was getting imprecise data aborts, and the DSCR is not being
</I>&gt;<i> re-read to clear them.  This causes all instruction execution to

I assume you are getting those when halting the core? There is a 
commented out piece of code where the data abort handling should go. 
What would be a reliable test case for that condition that can be packed 
into a endless while loop?

This issue seems to be treated differently between ARM1137 and ARM1167. 
And considering the experience with the RTI topic I wouldn't want to 
implement this just based on theoretical explanations in the manual...

&gt;<i> BTW, I am using an arm1176jz in an SOC.  My main goal is to use the
</I>&gt;<i> openocd as a flash programming tool, with debugging as a bonus.
</I>
Regarding flashing, my priorities are the other way around as we have 
alternative means for that on our SoC.
