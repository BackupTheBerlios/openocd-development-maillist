Well, if the rearranged startup behaviour causes some memory to be read before 
it's initialized, then that's bug that needs fixing.

&gt;<i> It's impossible to analyze.
</I>
Uhm, no, not really. That's the beauty of leaving uninitialized values 
uninitialized till you know what to initialize them with - accessing them 
before that point can be caught.

See the attached valgrind run:

The interesting part starts at line 375:

375 ==7822== ERROR SUMMARY: 113 errors from 4 contexts (suppressed: 21 from 1)

Not everything valgrind lists as an error is really one, so we'll have to go 
through the list:

378 ==7822== Invalid read of size 4

This is somewhere in the runtime linker, called on behalf of some pthread 
function, which is only used by FTD2XX, and can be ignored for our purposes.

407 ==7822== Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)

That's the kind of error we're looking for, but again it's within ld-2.6.1.so, 
called on behalf of FTD2XX.

422 ==7822== Invalid read of size 4

Again, this is beacause of FTD2XX.

450 ==7822== Syscall param ioctl(USBDEVFS_BULK).data points to uninitialised 
byte(s)

This one could be interesting. Maybe the validate chain function doesn't 
initialize all the buffers like it should. I'll look into this.

That's it - no more errors during this short test run. I've ran a similar test 
using daemon_startup reset with the same results. Of course this is by no 
means complete, but I guess it shows the idea behind leaving unitialized 
values uninitialized.

Now an example of why zero isn't a sane default:

&gt;<i> typedef struct xscale_common_s
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i>     int common_magic;
</I>
ACK, zero would be fine here.

&gt;<i>     /* XScale registers (CP15, DBG) */
</I>&gt;<i>     reg_cache_t *reg_cache;
</I>
ACK, a NULL pointer is something that an be caught

&gt;<i>     /* pxa250, pxa255, pxa27x, ixp42x, ... */
</I>&gt;<i>     char *variant;
</I>
ACK, a NULL pointer is something that an be caught

&gt;<i>     xscale_jtag_t jtag_info;
</I>
Not a pointer, but the structure itself. Let's have a look at xscale_jtag_t:

&gt;<i> typedef struct xscale_jtag_s
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i>     /* position in JTAG scan chain */
</I>&gt;<i>     int chain_pos;
</I>
Zero certainly isn't a good default value for chain_pos. If there was any code 
accessing chain_pos before it's initialized with the value from the target 
config line, I'd definitely like to know.

This is just an example - I don't know whether there's a chance of reading 
chain_pos before its initialized - but it clearly shows what potential 
problems can be hidden by using calloc without need.

Best regards,

Dominic
