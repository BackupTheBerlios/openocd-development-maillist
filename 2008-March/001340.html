<PRE>Hi Dominic, Gururaja and List,

I can confirm that I was able to halt the AT91SAM9260 out of reset using
Dominic's recommendation.

Attached are the modified scripts.

Gururaja, an OCD sequence to make sure that OCD is in the correct state
for a reset is the following commands (which can be used in GDB with the
&quot;monitor&quot; prefix):

halt
mww 0xfffffd08 0xa5000501         # RSTC_MR : enable user reset
jtag_speed 1200                   # Set JTAG speed to 5 kHz
reset

The following line gives sufficient working area for faster flashing,
you do not need to initialise SDRAM:

working_area 0 0x00300000 0x1000 backup

Best regards,
Pieter Conradie

No, it doesn't. But the core clock stops while the target is held in
reset, 
and so the TCK synchronizer circuit stops the JTAG clock as well. It is 
important not to use srst_pulls_trst, because that prevents debugging
out of 
reset, which is otherwise possible with this target.

You may have to use larger jtag_ntrst_delay and jtag_nsrst_delay
settings, to 
stop the OpenOCD from trying to communicate with the target too early.

Best regards,

Dominic
