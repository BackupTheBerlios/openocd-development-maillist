I found these manuals very frustrating. Other than the samples there 
seems to be no clear explanation of the mechanism. And the samples have 
some obvious errors so they should probably be taken with a grain of 
salt too. I came to the same conclusion as you first and then found 
through trial&amp;error that the repeated RTI really is needed.

&gt;<i> (or at least clarify this).  The problem that I WAS having, was that
</I>&gt;<i> I was getting imprecise data aborts, and the DSCR is not being

I assume you are getting those when halting the core? There is a 
commented out piece of code where the data abort handling should go. 
What would be a reliable test case for that condition that can be packed 
into a endless while loop?

This issue seems to be treated differently between ARM1137 and ARM1167. 
And considering the experience with the RTI topic I wouldn't want to 
implement this just based on theoretical explanations in the manual...

&gt;<i> BTW, I am using an arm1176jz in an SOC.  My main goal is to use the
</I>&gt;<i> openocd as a flash programming tool, with debugging as a bonus.
</I>
Regarding flashing, my priorities are the other way around as we have 
alternative means for that on our SoC.
