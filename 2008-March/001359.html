<PRE>Hello list,

the attached patch adds generic on-chip loader flash driver, I have posted pretty long time ago,
this is an updated version.

What the OCL driver is/does:
- communicates with loader code running on the target through DCC
- provides generic way to quickly implement loading of data to arbitrary device
connected to the target, not only its flash memory, but e.g. for FPGA configuration.
- the driver does not care about how the loader got to the target, about its address
or address of the buffer. This is typically handled by a script which ensures the loader is there and running.
Driver just expects this to be done before its operation and that is what makes is generic.
- it is not necessary to recompile OpenOCD to create new loader

The ZIP file contains an example OCL for flashing AT91SAM7x - take is as an example,
it would still be better to have support for semi-hosted flashing of AT91SAM7x included directly in OpenOCD of course.
Note: the flashing speed is about 35 KB/s with PRESTO which is about 3 times faster than using flash driver included
in OpenOCD (that is also why I created this particular loader).

Note: currently, the OCL driver makes use of DCC which is not available in all targets.
Alternative means of communication with the loader may be implemented in the future.

Does anyone else find this useful?

Regards,
   Pavel
