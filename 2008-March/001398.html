<PRE>Hello &#216;yvind,

&#216;yvind Harboe napsal(a):
&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; &quot;reset_config srst_and_trst srst_pulls_trst&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  This combination seems perfectly ok to me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So you're saying that the above implies that it is possible to pull trst only?
</I>
Well... yes! The target may *internally* reset the TAP controller when SRST is pulled.
That is *exactly* the case. In addition, there may be TRST brought to an external pin.
I am not sure about particular part doing this but I think it was already brought up in this list
(LPCxxxx? Anyone could comment on this?)
This looks like the case <A HREF="http://www.embeddedrelated.com/groups/lpc2000/show/9726.php">http://www.embeddedrelated.com/groups/lpc2000/show/9726.php</A>

It is pretty unlikely to have it wired that way on the target board, even though possible,
&quot;reset_config srst_only srst_pulls_trst&quot; is certainly much more common.
I don't know, whether there are any benefits of not using srst_only instead,
but ARMs targets vary pretty much, who knows...


&gt;<i> :-) I'm not suggesting that the device should say anything about the
</I>&gt;<i> target, only itself. E.g. can it assert TRST or not?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  The only think the JTAG driver may provide is whether it provides both reset signal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  or just a single reset signal (without defining it's meaning, this actually depends
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  on how the user connects it).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The interface will be queried as to whether it can support the requested reset
</I>&gt;<i> type. If requested reset type is strst_and_trst and the interface only has
</I>&gt;<i> srst hooked up, it must fail.
</I>
Actually JTAG interface does not have SRST. The target does. If the JTAG interface is equipped
by only a single reset line, it is up to the user whether (s)he hooks it to
SRST or to both SRST+TRST (or just to TRST... pretty weird, huh, but still...)

Again, it is disputable which combinations really make sense, but this is not what
the JTAG driver knows. It is up to the user to hook the wires the right way

Practical example: PRESTO has just a single reset line.
So I programmed the driver that it asserts the line whenever any of TRST or SRST is requested
and everything else is about proper configuration.
In fact, the JTAG driver does not care at all where the single reset line goes,
it completely trusts the target layer to do it's stuff correctly.

IMHO, the JTAG driver shall not be more smart than necessary, let someone who knows more decide,
that is, the *user* shall make the final decision if (s)he likes.


&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; - the specific target has rules about how a reset must take place. This should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt;   be encoded in the target script.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &quot;May take place&quot;, not &quot;must take place&quot;, if ever, there may be several options.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please explain a bit.
</I>
There is often more than one way how to handle reset and that is what OpenOCD
currently does. It chooses on of the possibilities according to given reset_config.
Hence &quot;may&quot; not &quot;must&quot; which looks like implying one and only choice.

Regards,
   Pavel
