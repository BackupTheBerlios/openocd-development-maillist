In a C++ compiler many common pointer cast errors simply cannot happen 
because they are detected at compile time (in C they are detected too, 
at crash time). Consider all the void *'s in the source code, they would 
mostly be gone, none of those are verified by the compiler.

Or this simple comparison

C:
int arm966e_read_cp15(target_t *target, int reg_addr, u32 *value)
{
	armv4_5_common_t *armv4_5 = target-&gt;arch_info;
	arm7_9_common_t *arm7_9 = armv4_5-&gt;arch_info;
	arm_jtag_t *jtag_info = &amp;arm7_9-&gt;jtag_info;

	...
	arm_jtag_scann(jtag_info, 0xf);



C++:
int arm966e_t::read_cp15(int reg_addr, u32 &amp; value)
{
	jtag_info.scann(0xf);


which one has more code and therefore more potential for errors? Which 
one has more copy&amp;paste duplicated code that is especially prone to 
errors when imported with modifications from other parts of the project? 
Which one has two void * pointer casts that cannot be examined by the 
compiler? Which one forces the person verifying the code to focus on 
bureaucratic details of data access while distracting from what the 
function actually does at its core?

There are also lots of mallocs in the code that calculate data sizes for 
structs manually, something the C++ compiler's new/new[] operator can do 
for you while guaranteeing a bug free result and better readability.

There are endless amounts of data structures where each member gets 
pre-initialized manually to a default value, something that a C++ 
constructor not only does more elegantly without code clutter but also 
consistently across the whole project whenever that structure is 
extended. This can be implemented in C too with an init function but in 
C++ its automatic and can not be forgotten by mistake.

If you convert the function pointer structs that serve as interfaces to 
abstract C++ classes you get predictable error detection whenever you 
extend the interface (new function; function parameter modification) and 
one of the implementations is out of sync.

C++ also uses function name mangling. So that functions between 
different compilation units are matched at link time. Function 
prototypes are a nice way to achieve the same at compile time, but with 
headers from different projects mixed together (like f.e. FTDI driver 
headers) there is potential for hard to trace conflicts (differences in 
the declarations of basic data types for example), that would be obvious 
to a c++ linker that is matching mangled function names.

If you consistently add const's the compiler can detect unwanted data 
modifications in lower layers.

If you use references instead of pointers you can reduce cases where a 
NULL is accidentally passed as parameter when that is not allowed by the 
receiving function.

C++ namespaces allow you to reduce function names and make the code 
better readable. Better readable code in general allows you to focus on 
the algorithm instead of syntactic redundancy. Simplicity = less error 
potential.

If rewritten more extensively there are also potential benefits when 
applying C++ functionality to the core of the project. For example a 
class that encapsulates all these register values in big/little endian 
and gets rid of all the malloc/memcpy activity between each layer by 
using advanced pointer types.
