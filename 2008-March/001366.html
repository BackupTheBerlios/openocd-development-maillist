Well, sort of. However it is designed from scratch, and the interface
between the flash driver and the on-chip running loader is kept rather minimalistic
so that the loader can be made small enough to run entirely from on-chip SRAM.
(I am not sure about actual footprint of ecosflash loaders but the elf files
are about 40 KB, which is huge in these measures.)

&gt;<i> Can we have a library of such flash drivers, like ecosflash, so it's

Sure, actually that is one of the reasons I have posted it
in hope that the community would help with creating more loaders.
AT91SAM7 is the first loader which might be useful to wider public.

&gt;<i> I guess a lot of users just want to have the right incantation to bring

</I>
Of course, I agree.
And also with this i mind I have designed OCL driver for those who would like to
contribute by implementing flashing of particular part without knowledge of single bit of
OpenOCD's internals. The protocol running over DCC is very lightweight and simple, I would say trivial.

I hope I find some more time (or someone else does) to create brief doc about
implementing new loader.

Regards,
   Pavel
