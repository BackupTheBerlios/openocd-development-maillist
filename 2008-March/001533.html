jtag_speed is completely hardware dependant, although it is implemented as a 
divisor for most of the existing interfaces (PRESTO is different, afaik).

For the FT2232 based devices the resulting frequency is 6MHz / (1+jtag_speed), 
for the parallel port bitbanging interface it's roughly 250kHz / (1 + 
jtag_speed), but that heavily depends on the PC. An interface supporting RTCK 
might define jtag_speed 0 to mean &quot;RTCK&quot;.

You all know I'm against automatisms, and of course I don't like the jtag 
autospeed either. Consider an ATMEL SAM9 target:

- starts up with a core clock of 32.768kHz after a reset
- runs at up to ~200MHz
- uses a -S core, which requires a JTAG TCK synchronization circuit which 
limits the maximum TCK frequency to core clock / 6.

If the OpenOCD attaches with daemon_startup reset, reset mode reset_halt, the 
JTAG clock must be less than 5.5kHz, which means a jtag_speed divisor of 
~1100 or more. The user definitely should know about that, because otherwise 
he wont know when to increase the JTAG frequency again (after enabling and 
selecting the PLL).

If the OpenOCD attaches with daemon_startup attach, the first connection 
attempt might work just fine (PLL already enabled and selected), but on a 
subsequent reset, communication will fail.

Also, because there's no defined meaning of the jtag_speed setting, the 
auto-speed code can't assume that a higher setting results in a lower 
frequency. A more sophisticated device might simply use jtag_speed as a kHz 
setting, which is the most natural form for a user to enter the desired 
frequency.

Best regards,

Dominic
