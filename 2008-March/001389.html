Hello list,

a change to OpenOCD made some time ago allows for execution of any command during
config stage. However, some of the commands cannot be invoked before
the config stage is finished and initialization is complete, see main function in openocd.c

This may be limiting in certain situations. The current state does provide with a clean
way to run OpenOCD and instruct it directly on the command line what to do after it is initialized,
e.g. program given image to flash memory and then exit - or whatever.
I know there is a possibility to use reset script for this, but this is just a nasty
workaround as reset scripts are meant for a bit different task.

My proposal to solve this is to introduce new command which would explicitly end the config stage
and invoke the initialization so that all further commands are executed on fully initialized debugger.
If this command is not used, the initialization is done after the command line and the config scripts
are finished, the same way as it is now.

Basically What I am planning to try is to moving the initialization code on lines 112-130 in main.c
to a separate function called either explicitly on behalf of a command or implicitly after the config stage
is finished.

Any comments or suggestions on this, please?

Another matter is name for the command for invoking explicit initialization:
- init
- init_all (or init all, allowing for future extension by using different argument than &quot;all&quot;)
- do_init (imperative, a little bit odd, but expresses the meaning of the command pretty well)
- config_done or config_end (does not express what it actually does wery well, rather a vague name, isn't it?)
(let's say, it is in order of my personal preference)

I would be glad to hear your comments,
Best regards

   Pavel
