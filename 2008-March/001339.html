<PRE>Hi,

Thanks  to Pieter Conradie for sharing the Script and config file

Thanks to Dominic Rath for giving such a good explanation for clk speed and its sync with JTAG TCK

Now i updated the flash script and changed jtag_speed to 1 after setting initial pll to proper clock speed.

now i am able to write to flash even when flash is erased/its new.

At present the sdram is not initialized so i am flashing with no working_area. 
i will figure it out on how to initial the sdram the board has (looking at at91sam9260_reset_script.ocd) and then will test with working_area.
if success, i will mail it back to list

Thanks for all the support.

Regards
Gururaja

Hi Gururaja,

Here are the scripts that worked for me. You will still have to tweak it for your specific board!

There are a few points / workarounds that you should take note of:

1. It seemed for me that the AT91SAM9260 pulls NTRST when SRST is activated. Thus I opted for the following option and used a &quot;soft_reset_halt&quot; in the reset script:

reset_config srst_only srst_pulls_trst trst_push_pull srst_open_drain

2. Your working area address looks suspect. I used the second internal SRAM bank (4k in size) using the following option:

working_area 0 0x00300000 0x1000 backup

3. I have Intel NOR Flash JS28F128P30T85 connected to Chip Select 0. This means the base address is 0x10000000. Therefore the option is:

flash bank cfi 0x10000000 0x01000000 2 2 0

Is your base address correct?

4. My reset script initialises the external FLASH and a 32-bit SDRAM interface. It is provided for example only and may not be needed in your case.

5. I explicitely disabled the &quot;user reset&quot; option with &quot; mww 0xfffffd08 0xa5000500&quot;. It looks like OpenOCD / Olimex ARM-USB-TINY combo toggles the SRST pin anyway when a reset command is issued, even though &quot;soft_reset_halt&quot; is used. This stuffs up the JTAG synchronisation and OpenOCD fails to recover.

See if &quot;flash probe 0&quot; and flash info 0&quot; return legible results. Good luck!

Best regards,
Pieter Conradie

Hi,

I am using latest openocd revision 404.-&gt; Open On-Chip Debugger 1.0 (2008-03-01-15:30) svn:404 No patches applied.
i am working on a customized version arm versatile arm926ej-s based board i am using Amontec JTAGKey tiny JTAG Adapter

Here is the thing,

The board Flash is completely erased. so the board is dead. 
now i am trying to connect to the board at very low rate ( jtag_speed 1500 ). i have given few board initialize code through script file. tried to provide a small working area with this Boards connects and flash probe goes success. flash info also correct. now i try to use flash write_bank and i get a very new error never seen before. with this openocd server also exists

 &gt; flash write_bank 0 u-boot.bin 0x0
 FT_Write returned: 4
 couldn't write MPSSE commands to FT2232  Connection closed by foreign host.

openocd error before quitting
MMU: disabled, D-Cache: disabled, I-Cache: disabled

flash bank cfi 0x2c000000 0x1000000 2 2 0

*******************************************************************

could someone shed some light on this.

could this be an issue that sdram is not initialized. i am just guessing. 

i am also now trying without working_area and its showing 
&gt;<i> flash write_bank 0 u-boot.bin 0x0
</I>not enough working area available(requested 96, free 0) Programming at 2c000000, count 0001a66c bytes remaining

and this has taken more than 10 min

Thanks in advance.

Gururaja
