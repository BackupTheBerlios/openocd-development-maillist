Hello,

Ville Voipio napsal(a):
&gt;<i> there will be very few hints towards parallel port devices. USB is the 
</I>&gt;<i> only (relatively) safe bet right now.
</I>
Luckily, OpenOCD does not rely on any particular connection between
itself and the physical JTAG pins...

&gt;<i> The bad thing here is that USB requires intelligence in the dongle 
</I>&gt;<i> itself, as bit-banging is very slow if wone one bit at a time.
</I>
Actually, not much intelligence beside shifting bits is needed.

BTW, that is why I created bitq.[ch] layer (queue counterpart of bitbang.[ch])
as bit shifting is a common task for many various interfaces.
The bitq.c layer provides interface for low level driver which is really simple, taking care just of its stuff.
The actual low level driver does not need to know anything about JTAG queue/commands.
Unfortunately, bitq.c is currently used only by PRESTO.

Sumarizing this, currenty the drivers for JTAG devices may be hooked 4 different ways:
1) high level driver, using jtag.c as next higher layer and interpreting OpenOCD's JTAG commands
2) low level driver using bitbang.c as next higher layer, using direct I/O on the other end
3) low level driver using bitq.c as next higher layer, using bit shifting with possible latency on the input
4) recently added support for replacement of jtag.c queuing functions enabling hw FIFO to be used (thanks to &#216;yvind Harboe)

&gt;<i> My hunch is that FT2232 is the most important USB interface at the moment.
</I>
Probably true, but what I value on OpenOCD most it it's generic approach concerning
JTAG queueing, enabling high latency connections like USB to work with good performance.

I believe, that it should be easily possible to reimplement support for FT2232 based dongles
to make use of bitq.c centralizing the JTAG queue processing logic for this types of interfaces
(easier to debug, no need for patching and testing several drivers in case of changes to JTAG command queue,
and moving the reference implementation of JTAG queue processing higher, out of the driver which is hw dependent)

The new FT2232 driver would actually contain only open/cleanup out/in/inrdy functions, nothing more.
I consider this to be a good idea (comments are welcome)
However, I do not have any FT2232 dongle, neither much time to experiment with this, any volunteers?

The bitq interface is not much documented, nevertheless, it is pretty straightforward.
If anyone has questions about it, do not hesitate to contact me.

Best regards,

Pavel
