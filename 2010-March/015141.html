I think for ST and NXP, their presence and/or support in US
may not be so good. But I assume in France/Eeurope they should be
much better. In Singapore, both seems to be okay and I think both
have fabs (or partner fabs) here. TI is not bad as well.

Anyway, this is based on my work experience and I work for a
relative big US MNCs so I enjoy some good support from various
vendors. ;-) I mainly deal with analog parts (ADI, Maxim, TI, etc)
but I do participate the discussions on MCUs (ST, TI, Freescale,
Renesas, Microchip, etc).

TI seems to have some delivery problems now. Maybe it is due
to the fab-lite policy of the IDMs. On the analog side, it seems
that ADI (and even Microchip) is trying to communicate to the
customers that they can supply TI-compatible parts like OpAmp.
