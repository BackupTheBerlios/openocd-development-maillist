It' tended not to start up properly on my PXA255.  Resetting doesn't
work reliably the second time through.  And it's been useless at finding
out why for example Linux wedges part way through startup.

&gt;<i> Still test driving. &#160;One frustration that I just diagnosed

</I>
We've been fixing a lot of those cache problems with software breakpointing
over the last 6-8 months or so.  It'll be good to see XScale fixed too.
