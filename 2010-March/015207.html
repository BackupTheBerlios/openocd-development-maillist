</I>In the original code the &quot;for&quot; loop iterates across the whole
sectors[] array, while only the &quot;first&quot; and the &quot;last&quot; are really
important.
And every time &quot;first&quot; or &quot;last&quot; is changed, the array is scanned again.
Moreover, with original &quot;for&quot; boundaries, the condition &quot;i == last&quot; is
never true inside loop's  body.

All such issues convinced me that code needs a deep review.
My first patch was just aimed at a quick fix without too much concern
about consistency between code and comments, looking for a better
code.
Apologise for increasing confusion.

&gt;&gt;<i> Moreover, it splits the first-last interval and should improve performance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't follow what you mean by this.  Do you mean it addresses
</I>&gt;<i> the REVISIT comment by issuing multiple driver requests if it works
</I>&gt;<i> out that there are discontiguous regions?  That's not necessarily
</I>&gt;<i> going to be faster... and such a change would have been more clearly
</I>&gt;<i> done as a separate patch.
</I>Yes, the idea is to include also the REVISIT comment in the final patch.
But also remove all the useless iterations on the array
