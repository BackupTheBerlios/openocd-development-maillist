<PRE>
&gt;<i>I'm not surprised.  The XScale code still doesn't work well on my single
</I>&gt;<i>rather old (&quot;classic&quot;) PXA ... and given some of the problems I saw with it,
</I>&gt;<i>I didn't think that code can ever have ben solid.
</I>
Actually not bad.  Still test driving.  One frustration that I just diagnosed
is that software breakpoints often don't work if icache is enabled by the
target code (for reasons that are obvious in retrospect; cached instruction is
executed instead of the BKPT command written to memory by openocd).  I'd like
to submit a patch soon that invalidates the icache after the BKPT instruction
is written.  Suggestions / corrections of course gratefully received.

&gt;&gt;<i> The resolution is straightforward ...
</I>
Straightforward because the functionality is already there, but the
xscale_enable_mmu_caches() command is just called incorrectly (might be an
error pasting from the xscale_handle_mmu_command()).

&gt;<i>I'll have a look in a bit.  Thanks.
</I>
Thanks for taking a look.

Mike
