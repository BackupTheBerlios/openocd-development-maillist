I don't know about ST's licensing for its CM3 software.

TI inherited some rather antagonistic licences from Luminary,
but have also said they're looking at fixing some of the issues.
I'm not sure when I'd expect such a thing to happen ... but some
folk have pointed out that it looks like even public discussion
of their calls is not allowed.  (Teh big suxx0r!)

There's this CMSIS thing, which seems like it's the right idea
(vendor-neutral low level code for Cortex-M chips) but which may
be hobbled by hardware vendors trying to achieve vendor lock-in
through their software libraries.  Ditto by compiler vendors.
There's some very low level stuff that's reusable, but the next
level up &quot;middleware&quot; would seem to suffer politics.  (Surprise!!)

I've got a pretty simple Cortex-M3 tasking library (GPL'd) that
I could share ... timers, mutexes, and all that.  That's of
course only one of the things a libre Cortex-M software stack
would be needing.
