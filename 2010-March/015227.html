I was hoping you'd like it ...  I know you'd like to be able to
use more Versaloon capabilities through OpenOCD.


&gt;<i> Note that SRST isn't ONLY used in JTAG or SWD, AVR_ISP

</I>
Right; point being, &quot;not JTAG-specific.


&gt;<i> How about make SRST a &quot;transport&quot; and can generate a
</I>&gt;<i> reset event. Then, Cortex-M3 target will need JTAG+SRST
</I>&gt;<i> or SWD+SRST &quot;transports&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> But problem will be that SRST and TRST will not be able to

</I>&gt;<i> Compromise Maybe that JTAG/SWD can handle SRST and
</I>&gt;<i> meanwhile there exists a SRST &quot;transport&quot;.
</I>
Debug support for Cortex-M3 doesn't need SRST; there are
NVIC operations which remove that requirement.

My current plan is to just make SRST support be an
debug adapter (&quot;Interface&quot; facility, as distinct from
JTAG support as we practical.  (Which for now isn't as
much as I'd like.)


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Moreover, I think maybe more than one &quot;transports&quot; can be
</I>&gt;<i> validated on one target. For example, &quot;transport&quot; for debug port
</I>&gt;<i> and &quot;transport&quot; for trace port can be validated at the same time.
</I>
Some day, maybe.   supporting two transports at once is a complex
concept.  coordinating asynchronous actiivties like that is racey
(and thus error prone).  I'd rather avoid such stuff in userspace;
kernel code has the synchronization primitives needed, but they are
a huge portability problem for userspace.  and I haven't seen a need
for  it yet.

(Trace port support is an interesting thing to plan for though.
