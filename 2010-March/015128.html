Surely that's because OpenOCD doesn't claim to support those
chips in the first place...

MAXQ is a 16-bit CPU which a quick web search suggests has no support
from GCC or GDB, either.  Though it does at least seem to use JTAG for
the transport to its on-chip debug (OCD) module...

The most I'd expect you to be able to do with OpenOCD is use the
autprobe mechanism to discover that one exists on the scan chain,
and report a few basic TAP attributes.  And as Michael noted,
maybe SVF and/or XSVF support would work.



&gt;<i> Also I have the hell using OpenOCD with a SiLabs C8051F502.
</I>
Same story.  No GCC or GDB support for 8051 cores either.

I'd not think it would happen soon either.  Maybe GCC 4.5.x
versions could start to use the named address space feature
from ISO/IEC TR 18037 to help sort out the mess with SFRs (they
need their own address space.)   8051 is not compiler-friendly.
I've never seen a compiler that generated 8051 code without
requiring extensions to C ... (I looked at C for 8051 a few years
back.  At that time SDCC was the main non-payware option, and
it wasn't IMO very good.)

Likewise, no OpenOCD for that particular chip.  A quick scan of
the manual for that chip doesn't find any reference to JTAG.
Evidently it uses yet another proprietary transport for OCD.



&gt;<i> Any suggestions?
</I>
Switch to chips with good GCC/GDB/OpenOCD tools support, or
help develop that support for your chosen chips.


Also: Read the Fine Manual; we've been working to make sure
the OpenOCD User's Guide covers all the important stuff, like
which cores are supported.

Current manuals can be read (HTML or PDF) at

Or, of course, built from the source code.
