<PRE>I have been using openocd on an older fedora 8 machine and get OK speeds 
and responsiveness. Insight debugger indicates a download speed of 11 
Kbps when programming to flash (64k). Stepping is reasonably quick even 
with watch and/or memory windows open.

However, I have needed to use the same versions of openocd and Insight 
on another machine running fedora 12 and it seems noticeably slower even 
though the processor is faster and it has more memory. The download 
speed is about 4 Kbps and stepping is very slow and almost painful if 
there are any watch or memory windows to update between steps. Also, 
opening the same size watch window (e.g., var with 256 array elements) 
seems to take quite a bit longer.

In other respects the new machine is quite a bit faster, such as general 
responsiveness and time to compile programs. The new machine claims to 
have usb 2.0 ports. I should also mention that the new machine is 64bit 
while the old machine is 32bit. Openocd is compiled for 32bit.

In both cases I am using the olimex-arm-usb-ocd device and using  libusb 
and libftdi.

I was wondering if anyone can suggest a way to troubleshoot or benchmark 
the usb ports on this machine to find out why they are slower than the 
old machine when running openocd.

Thanks,

-gene
