Ah oh. Hopefully the work for OpenOCD PIC32 will continue.
I see Spen is doing some work on it. Someone just need to
ports newlib or things like that to GCC to get the missing link.

Microchip's C32 does not have code size limitation though,
but rather optimization limit (related to the library). So it is
still usable for many people.

&gt;&gt;<i> Personally I think Microchip is wrong to choose the MIPS core.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It was cheaper they thought &amp; faster?
</I>
I do not know the reasons. There are rumors that one potential
reason is that MIPS allows Microchip to add proprietary ICSP
protocol and trace functionality to the MIPS M4K core whereas
ARM does not. Microchip wants to support existing tools like
ICD 2, ICD 3 and Real ICE which do not speak JTAG.

&gt;<i> They may be regretting this decision already and the

</I>&gt;<i> when they finally do come to their sense and license ARM. :-)
</I>
I think PIC32 should still have appeals to those who upgrade
from PIC18 and PIC24. So Microchip can still do reasonably
well from PIC32, but not the success it gets in the 8-bit market.

OpenOCD for PIC32 should be able to help Microchip to
get into more users' hands.
