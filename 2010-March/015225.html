OK, part of it (preliminary patches to come later):

 * There will be a &quot;struct transport&quot; with a name and various
   methods.  Inside OpenOCD there will be a list of registered
  transports, and one transport that's active for the current
  session.

 * a &quot;transport_list command will display what transports the
   current OpenOCD understands ... initially &quot;jtag&quot;, soon also &quot;swd&quot;.

    - &quot;Programmer&quot; transports can be defined, like &quot;UART&quot;, which
      I imagine could someday work like
	  * Cortex-M3 with &quot;lm3s&quot; variant could use the Stellaris
	    bootloader packet formats
	  * Cortex-M3 with &quot;lpc17xx&quot; variant could use NXP's
	   bootloader ISP programming scheme
	  * ... some chips (like AVR8) have SPI variants too
	  * ... etc

 * Debug adapters will be associated with one or more transport
   names.  I'm thinking they'd normally be declared by the debug
   adapter driver, but there will also be an option for doing it
   via Tcl scripts (in case of e.g. needing hardware jumpering).

   We'll have  lot of JTAG-only adapters, also JTAG-and-SWD.
   Versaloon, BusPirate, and Signalyzer can do many more...


 * To select between transport options from the debug adapters,

	&quot;transport select swd&quot; (or jtag, etc) ... no args will
        report the current transport (for conditional scripts)

      Except after &quot;transport_select jtag&quot;, the JTAG script commands
      will not be available. 

 * We'd try to make JTAG-only debug adapters behave prettty much
   the way they do today (no extra config needed)

 * For the Cortex-M parts which have two transport options, I'm
   thinking we'd replace &quot;jtag newtap&quot; with a new declaration that
   would work with SWD not just JTAG ... so target config files would
   easily work with either transport ... maybe it'd look like &quot;dap new ...&quot;
   We may want a new type for what's now &quot;target-&gt;tap&quot; ...

   We'll likely need a command to manipulate SRST by itself, and which can
   work with both JTAG and SWD sessions.  Otherwise I can imagine some of
   the target event handlers breaking.  Ditto updating interface clocks.

 * Individual targets will have &quot;target create&quot; options to cope with
   issues like LPC13xx Cortex-M3 cores being SWD-only.  I'm thinking

      &quot;target create -transport swd ...&quot; will mean &quot;-chain-position X&quot; is
      not allowed, and JTAG-only sessions won't work with that target.
