It references SVN, so ... clearly not!  But the functional summary isn't

For kernel debug, MMU support will surely be one thing to address.

I'd distinguish between A8 support and OMAP3 support.  They're not
entirely the same.  The MX51 chips don't &quot;just come up&quot; for example.

There's a bit of generic CoreSight/DAP work to be done.  Some of it
has FIXME comments in the ADI v5 or A8 suppport code ... A few things that
come to mind include:

 * Don't hard-wire assumptions about the DAP.  Look at its ROM table and
   use the data there .... instead of assuming fixed numbers for the debug
   AP and mem AP, and debug_base.  Save any ETM or ETB addresses.  THere's
   currently a bunch of code wrongly assuming A8 == OMAP3.

 * Look at details of debug entry/exit and fix a lot of the corner cases
   that are currently fudged.  The ARMv6/v7 spec is clear that much behavior
   should be shared between ARMv6 (ARM11) and ARMv7A) (Cortex-A) suppport ...
   the DPM code doesn't share as much as it should.

 * Along those same lines .... hard and soft breakpoint support for ARM11 and
   Cortex-A8 should be almost identical (arm_dpm.c).  ISTR that A8 doesn't yet
   have hard breakpoint support and ARM11 doesn't yet have soft, or maybe it's
   the other way around.

  * At some point ThumbEE support will deserve attention.  I don't know of
   anything relying on that mode yet, but surely that will come in time.

 * A clean way to tell GDB exactly what kind of core is present .... there's
   a way to do that with some GDB qXfer feature descriptor.  DO it right, and
   the floating point registers will no longer be pure lies.  (Nothing uses FPA
   any more, while OMAP3 has VFP3 ISTR ...)

  * Minimal suport for XDS100 JTAG adapters could be useful.  Don't get caught
    up in the legal issues there (TI has some strange licensing for schematic
    data) but maybe there's some bare-bones support possible without relying on
    more than the obvious (FT2232 uses four signals for JTAG, regardless)  that'd
    be easily customized .... at least, a private driver may be helpful for your
    own work.)

    One reason to care about xds100v2 is that it's got adaptive clocking suppport
    which means you can cope with the clock speed variations that Linux, for one
    example, will introduce.  WHen the core lock gates off, you will need to make
    sure you can still communicate over JTAG.  (This is another reason to want the
    ICEpick reset functionality...)

Well, that's a start.  Please send around what you come up with, so we can
give you some review before you dive in too deeply.
