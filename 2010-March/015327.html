This seems reasonable for me, but I don't know whether that's a right way.

This seems very fine, but:
1. (for example) STM32 can officially run up to 72MHz. However there are 
reports of ppl overclocking them to as much as 125MHz.
2. How would OpenOCD know whether this one is a board script and this 
one is not? Will it analyze the path of the files used?

Anyway - for me every it could be even extended - even if the target or 
board can run faster, the final word belongs to the adapter, which also 
has some maximum frequency. Maybe picking up the lowest value found in 
the config files would be enough? (with the possibility to override that 
somehow)

4\/3!!
