I've now spent some more time looking at this problem and have been
digging around in arm_adi_v5.c to see what's going on.

In the fault condition, even the first few operations in 
ahbap_debugport_init() don't seem to work. For example, reading the 
DP_CTRL_STAT register always returns 0. There's a loop which waits for 
the CDBGPWRUPACK bit in that register to be set. It never gets set in 
the fault condition, but the loop exits anyway and execution continues. 
I think this is a bug, but it doesn't affect the fault other than not 
reporting it.

There is an ABORT instruction in a special DR register (*not* one of the 
DPACC registers) which looks useful in potentially returning the debug 
unit to a sane state, or at least cancelling any outstanding debug 
transactions, but until I've got my head around how to make the 
necessary JTAG operation I can't get it to do anything.

I wanted to add some more basic tests of DR register reads other than 
the DPACC registers to check what was going on, and thought the IDCODE 
DR register would be a good start. I added:

adi_jtag_dp_scan_u32(swjdp, JTAG_DP_IDCODE, DP_IDCODE, DPAP_READ, 0, 
&amp;dummy, &amp;ack);
LOG_DEBUG(&quot;ahbap_debugport_init(): idcode=0x%&quot; PRIx32, dummy);

but this seems to return 0x16 in dummy, which is nothing like the IDCODE 
in the ARM/ST documentation (0x3BA00477). This happens on 'working' 
STM32s and in the fault condition. Am I doing something daft?

Can some kind soul help me navigate the various functions, please? I'm 
happy to spend the time investigating what's going on when armed with 
the necessary knowledge.

Chris
