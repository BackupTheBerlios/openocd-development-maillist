It's not about what users like to run (everyone should absolutely use
the environment they prefer) - it's about what different systems
allow in terms of a development environment, which is required to
build source code.

The Windows system that we can expect users have access to is an
incredibly limited development environment when compared to that
of Linux or MacOS X users. This matters when those users want to
do development (e.g. compile) of projects.

I think that it is important to optimize for users and to optimize
for developers, and that these two are very different things. I think
it's fine to place more requirements on developers and important to
have as few requirements as possible for users.


&gt;&gt;<i> and it's not really the task of openocd or any other project to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work around that.

</I>
There exists no easy build solution for the Windows systems that
users might have access to, because such systems are so limited.

This means that working on Windows will always have more
requirements.


&gt;&gt;<i> MSYS and Cygwin are significantly better environments, and they work

</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but do not confuse the &quot;how-to&quot; build and &quot;how-to&quot; use !!! We
</I>&gt;<i> build openocd for Windows under Cygwin and then we use openocd
</I>&gt;<i> binary on Windows without the need of Cygwin ...
</I>
Who is &quot;we&quot; ?

If the OpenOCD project produces some binaries then I feel strongly
that they should be built by MinGW and not using Cygwin.

It is fundamental to realise that Cygwin is not Windows. Cygwin is a
different system, running on top of Windows.


&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;/ This is not the case for the actual external Jim TCL .
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When there's no package management (like on Windows) dependencies

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dependencies within projects.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So why jimtcl directory in OpenOCD ?
</I>
I agree - I think the next step is to remove the jimtcl directory and
submodule, and only have a system jimtcl. This is the goal for me,
but there's no rush.

However, going to the submodule first might make the transition
easier, since it divides the change into two steps.
