Ok just as a follow up I've tested it with the fpga before and after
the arm on the chain (aka I rewired the hardware) and it behaves just
fine when the fpga is targetted by it's name:
openocd.exe -c &quot;svf a3p125.tap test.svf quiet&quot; -c exit

when openocd.cfg contains:
jtag newtap a3p125 tap -irlen 8 -expected-id 0x02a121cf
in the appropriate place

Leaving the command line set to plain executes the svf untouched and
it throws the same svf error as it did before, as it's not expecting a
chain.
Using a different svf that's been generated for the chain works fine
in both plain mode and targetted mode (targetted mode disables the
header/trailer commands just fine).
Using a different svf that's been generated for a different chain also
works fine, as again targetted mode disables the header/trailer
commands in the svf. This same svf fails in plain mode, as expected.

Basically all tests behaved as expected.

I think this patch is perfectly safe and reliable, it's only
question/downside is the modifying of an existing command line format.
I also can't say for sure whether I've really adhered to coding
standards with regard to commenting, structure, variables - but I
tried to base it on existing code around it.

With regard to command line usage, If you try to use the svf command
without new the plain/name switch it does give a usage message:

usage: svf &lt;device#|plain&gt; &lt;file&gt; [quiet]
Command handler execution failed
in procedure 'svf'

which again was made to be consistent with existing usage of xsvf command.

On a related node, is there a standard method of updating
documentation pages? are they accessible via svn/git or something to
easily make patches for updates to them?
My suggestion would be obviously to document the updated svf commands
and probably add to the FPGA/PLD page with a link to the svf page as
an alternative to the less maintained commands there.

Cheers,
Andrew
