I don't think that anyone has ever protested against this. Personally
I don't like this way of running openocd at all, but since some do of
course it should continue to work. Again, noone has protested against
this. Maybe you received little input on your suggestion, but that
can also mean that others are thinking about it and have not decided
yet. That's the case for me at least.


&gt;<i> Having cfg files for ALL supported targets in one solution, and I'm
</I>&gt;<i> willing to maintain such list for microcontrollers (arm7 and
</I>&gt;<i> cortex-m3)... Having REAL generic family config files is another
</I>&gt;<i> solution, but that's not as user friendly as the first solution...
</I>
In your use case. But in my use case files covering more devices are
more user friendly, since the same config file can be used for
different projects using a slightly different target from one family.

My first impression from openocd was that the target config files
mapped onto physical parts, which made sense to me, and I don't think
the fundamental thinking has really changed just because one or two
family files have been added. (e.g. stellaris)

However, from many other projects I have also seen lots of times that
people are very stupid or lazy when they want to add new support
which is very similar to existing support, and it is very easy to
copy and paste, which I find unacceptable if refactoring of some
common parts could be done.

The more copypaste we already distribute the more people will create,
which is something I think should be looked out for. The way to avoid
this is to have base config files for families that have common
settings, and per-target files which only have very few settings
specific for the target. Call it object orientation if that makes you
happy, though I hate that term. :)


&gt;&gt;<i> Now, OpenOCD is becoming more &amp; more difficult to build (with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dependency of external tools like JimTCL
</I>
Laurent, I'm really sorry that you are not comfortable with handling
a dependency for OpenOCD, but that is absolutely not a reason to keep
a copy of Jim within OpenOCD. I think you can mitigate your problem
by helping with integration of the packages into a package
distribution that is useful for you.

I think you indicated that you like to use Cygwin? It should be
really easy to add a Cygwin package for Jim, which eliminates your
problem with handling a dependency.


&gt;&gt;<i> and more and more difficult to use with changing System Reset idea ....
</I>
What idea? Seriously? What are you talking about?

The code that has been added does something in some way. We should be
happy that it works at all, and of course work on improving it.

The very definition of the open source concept is that if things do
not work the way we would like them to, then we have the power to fix
that. Complaining is not really so fruitful.


&gt;&gt;<i> If we do not keep the openocd Easy to use, we will certainly kill it,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You read my mind (;
</I>
This negative attitude is incredible! Why are you in the project at
all if you do not feel that it is useful for you in some way and/or
that you may be able to help improve it?

Please stop complaining, that's just an absolute waste of time!
Please instead work on how to move forward.
