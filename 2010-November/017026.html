access to the jtag on each board, I've just wired them into a chain by
making a custom cable to simulate how they'll be wired on the final design.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I actualy did try UrJTAG (even going to the extent of adding TI ICDI support
to is, I still need to submit the patch for that... ) but didn't get very
far there either, the UrJTAG parser didn't like some command or other in the
svf file.


As it turns out I did find the problem, and it's very basic. Amazing how
just writing down the problem thoroughly (to post a question) can be enough
to trigger an obvious idea.
It was a basic chaining issue. I had created the Actel project (with altium)
with the entire chain in place, so thought it would have created a svf file
specifically for the chain. Apparently not. All I had to do was connect the
TI ICDI programmer directly to the fpga's jtag (requiring another new custom
cable as it turned out) and the svf played no worries, and the part was all
flashed and ready to use!

Now I need to figure out how to bypass the lpc via software rather than
physically changing the chain. I can't seem to find much information about
how bypass works with openocd, do you have any idea?

Once I have it all sorted out I think this is well worth me making a wiki
page for programming fpga's on a chain, as there's not much info about it so
far, and it actually seems quite easy once you know what your're doing.
