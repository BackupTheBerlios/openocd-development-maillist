<PRE>Hi,
during the week-end I had access to one board with STR750. It's not
the evaluation board from ST.

Initially I had some issue with reset from JTAG, probably because the
on-board reset circuit differs from the original board.
After change the &quot;reset_config&quot; line in tcl/target/str750.cfg I was
able to properly reset.
I'm not providing any patch for this, since I expect the current
config file matches the evaluation board.

After that modification, I was still unable to execute &quot;reset init&quot;.
The default reset_init script in tcl/target/str750.cfg try to remove
flash protection.
I expect the failure was because the device has internal flash already
programmed and protected against duplication.
Anyway, &quot;reset halt&quot; was ok, and enough for my tests.

The board does not mount a serial NOR on SMI interface, but was easy
to temporarily connect one device.

In attachment a set of patches:
1) fix a segfault in case of no memory connected (my fault).
2) add STR750 as new device in SMI driver. This patch is much cleaner
than what I proposed last week.
    In the file tcl/target/str750.cfg I have added the proper HW
initialization for SMI in a separate procedure.
    This helped me to run &quot;reset halt&quot; followed by &quot;init_smi&quot; in place
of &quot;reset init&quot; (not working on my board).
    Should be also comfortable to anybody that needs to remove SMI support.
3) Since SMI is not anymore a SPEAr specific driver, this patch
changes all the names from &quot;spearsmi&quot; to &quot;stmsmi&quot;
4) last patch to rename &quot;spearsmi.c&quot; as &quot;stmsmi.c&quot;

All patches are ready to be committed.
Last 2 are not mandatory, but add consistency.

Best Regards,
Antonio Borneo
