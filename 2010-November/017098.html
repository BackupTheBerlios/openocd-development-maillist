</I>
I subscribed after those discussion, and it seems to me that we
continue to learn new things about reset, which means that the code
will change too.

Where to place a particular setting could easily turn into
bikeshedding, so I can understand if at some point in that discussion
a decision was made to do things in some particular way. I don't
think that means that it will never change.


&gt;<i> For me it should, but for the majority of OpenOCD maintainers it
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't and it won't be.
</I>
Please stop talking about how the future is hopeless for you! If
there is a good reason and a clean patch then anything and everything
will change.


&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe things need to get a little worse before they can get a lot
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better. I think we're still learning about cm3.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, but every maintainer has different opinion on what is &quot;right&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and what is &quot;better&quot;, that's why nothing get's changed
</I>
I would tend to disagree with that. From experience with many
different projects I know that also those who are considered
maintainers will not neccessarily *have* an opinion all the time.
However, I have noticed that they generally like to be thorough, I am
like that too, which means that learning what is right or best can
take time.

Making experiments, maybe in a branch, can be helpful, but if there
is not very active testing then the motivation for that will be
somewhat limited. If the goal is to steadily improve the codebase
then potentially many large changes will be neccessary to add
something like cm3 support, and that will take time.


&gt;<i> and the status quo will be here forever.
</I>
Very optimistic outlook. You are already changing status quo by
participating in this discussion, please remember that.


&gt;<i> IMO haveing target file for every supported chip (my recent proposal)
</I>&gt;<i> is very good and _very_ user-friendly,
</I>
I tend to agree with you that it is a good approach. I think I wrote
so already.


&gt;<i> I offered to do that, but maintainers were not interested,
</I>
Really? As in it was expressed that your idea was undesirable? If you
simply get no feedback that is not a protest. It may just be that
people are thinking about the change.


&gt;<i> so this mix of family-generic (stm32, stellaris) and
</I>&gt;<i> target-specific (lpc2103, lpc2148, at91sam7sx, at91sam7se, ...)
</I>&gt;<i> files will probably be here forever.
</I>
I don't think this is a bad thing. I would want more family files,
with the stuff that is really common for that family, and then target
files with stuff that is specific for the targets. The latter should
e.g. not really have any if statements, that would be in a family
file. Target files would also be pretty short. Probably just a few
lines.


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Completely off-topic: sometimes I think, that open-source projects
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> are just a cover-up made by people working for big companies
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sorry, this is a bit silly. I can understand that open source
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> projects are immensely frustrating if there is some kind of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> incompatibility, be it attitude or philosophy or even trivial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stuff like coding style.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This things may seem trivial, but imagine that someone produces a
</I>&gt;<i> patch that adds functioning support for SWD in OpenOCD and that
</I>&gt;<i> will not be accepted, because the lines are too long...
</I>
Personally I can not imagine this scenario at all. It is absolutely
foreign to me. I think it is a really unneccessary mistake to make
for someone who wants to get involved with an open source project.

It is important to remember that the person doing this has failed to
work *with* or *in* the project. They did their work on the side, and
then suggested it for inclusion. This is everyone's prerogative, but
it comes with significant risk - *especially* if one is new to the
project.

When joining any group it's important to &quot;fit in&quot;.

If the contributor you describe above has made no effort at all to
learn about e.g. the project coding style before submitting the
patch, then I consider the contributor to be clearly at fault.

If an effort was made to learn about the coding style but no response
was given, then instead the project is clearly at fault. It's very
important to help people with what they need in order to contribute.

If effort was made to learn about coding style and there was a good
response, but the contributor still submits a patch which goes
against the coding style, there's instead a problem of communication
or understanding, which are both very very difficult to deal with. A
completely different class of problem. Noone is clearly at fault and
how to resolve the situation depends on everyone involved. Quite
complicated.

Of course the latter is also incredibly frustrating for everyone
involved. I have first hand experience.


&gt;&gt;<i> I also completely understand that not everyone can do the changes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> themselves, but it's also important to remember that those who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> selflessly do want to contribute code changes that will help others
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have very limited resources, so it might take time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We can get back to my previous point. If that &quot;someone&quot; had produced a 
</I>&gt;<i> monolithic SWD patch, that would also not be accepted, because changes 
</I>&gt;<i> should be incremental, easy, isolated, and so on. But imagine how this 
</I>&gt;<i> contributor would feel when he/she would be told to spend another 100 hours 
</I>&gt;<i> on refactoring the patch that took hin'her 100 hours. I would probably just 
</I>&gt;<i> write &quot;love or leave&quot;...
</I>
In this hypothetical case it seems to me that the contributor was not
as wise as you are. If there had been a bit of discussion before
starting the work then probably there would have been no problem.

One thing I see in several projects is that the procedure needs to be
described many times, sometimes to the same contributors. The
eleventh time someone could of course react badly.

Documentation for developers is important to help with this, but they
also need to be written by someone.


&gt;&gt;<i> Just remember that this is really just piece of sh*t software that we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are hacking on to make it do a decent job.
</I>..
&gt;<i> It's not that I don't like OpenOCD, but how is it better than
</I>&gt;<i> commercial software that allows one to start debug session in 3
</I>&gt;<i> clicks (select target model, select debugger, click connect)?
</I>
Infinitely better for me because I hate using GUIs. But the steps
seem to be the same using the method you like:

$ openocd -f target/lpc2148.cfg -f interface/something.cfg

(One clear benefit of openocd is the remote control, which is not
really common in GUIs. Also, openocd is open source, which is an
immense benefit for me.)


&gt;<i> This attitude may seem a bit negative,
</I>
I don't think that's negative. If you see a GUI as a significant
benefit that's fine, and also a use case that should be considered in
openocd development, but that does not mean that openocd should
develop a GUI. Does that make sense? I think the remote control
feature of openocd is all that is needed (and &#216;yvind confirmed this)
to create a nice GUI.


&gt;<i> but believe me, that it's exact same attitude that a typical
</I>&gt;<i> newcomer to ARM's world shows.
</I>
I think it depends on where they are coming from. But I am all for
offering both a simple interface for those who do not need more, and
a powerful interface for those who can use that. Of course it needs
more work.


&gt;<i> Clarification:
</I>
Thanks!


&gt;<i> standard command &quot;reset_config&quot; can define that there are resets
</I>&gt;<i> present or not. Default is &quot;none&quot; and that is assumed when no
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;reset_config&quot; command is present.
</I>
By &quot;resets&quot; you mean physical signals, right? This makes sense.


&gt;<i> new command &quot;cortex-m3 reset_config&quot; can define reset method for
</I>&gt;<i> Cortex-M3 core - srst (real reset, only if the signal is available,
</I>&gt;<i> so &quot;reset_config srst&quot; is required), sysresetreq (almost-real-reset
</I>&gt;<i> - resets peripherals) or vectreset (soft-reset that does not reset
</I>&gt;<i> peripherals).
</I>
I think this makes sense too.


However, it's a little odd that cm3 has this special handling.. I
think it might be useful to consider refactoring the commands, but on
one hand I don't have good suggestions for how they could improve and
on the other I think e.g. SWD is more important in the immediate
term. Maybe a small fix to reset related commands makes sense though!


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1. no chip resets, no cortex-m3 reset method specified - use
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> SYSRESETREQ (now use VECTRESET - does not reset peripherals)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2. chip reset available, cortex-m3 reset method specified - use
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> cortex-m3 reset method that was specified
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What cm3 reset method would that be, for example? C code in OpenOCD?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> case 1 is when OpenOCD receives neither &quot;reset_config&quot; nor
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;cortex-m3 reset_config&quot;.
</I>
Ok. In this case I think openocd should exit with a fatal error,
since it isn't possible to assume about resets for cm3 targets.


&gt;<i> case 2 is when OpenOCD reveives &quot;reset_config srst / srst_and_trst&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and &quot;cortex-m3 reset_config srst / sysresetreq / vectreset&quot; - chip
</I>&gt;<i> would be reset with a method specified with the latter.
</I>
Good.


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 3. chip resets available, no cortex-m3 reset method specified - use SRST
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ok.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> case 3 is when OpenOCD reveives &quot;reset_config srst / srst_and_trst&quot; but
</I>&gt;<i> no &quot;cortex-m3 reset_config ...&quot; - normal reset signal is asserted.
</I>
I think this is similar to case 1, but it's a little complicated..

reset_config srst should maybe not mean that there is a default for
cm3. I think that missing a cortex-m3 reset_config for a cortex-m3
chip should be a fatal error.


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 4. no chip resets, cortex-m3 reset method specified - use it, but
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> if cortex-m3 reset method is SRST that will be changed to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> SYSRESETREQ (now it will be changed to VECTRESET, note as in 1.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Uh? So the cm3 reset method is not in C, but can be set to SRST?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> case 4 is when OpenOCD reveives &quot;reset_config none&quot; (or no &quot;reset_config&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> command) and &quot;cortex-m3 reset_config srst / sysresetreq / vectreset&quot; -
</I>&gt;<i> srst is impossible and it will be changed to sysresetreq (with my patch)
</I>
I think reset_config none + cortex-m3 reset_config srst must also be
a fatal error. It would be OK to create e.g. cortex-m3 reset_fallback
but maybe we can find an even better solution.


&gt;<i> or vectreset (current code), the chip will be reset using software
</I>&gt;<i> methods.
</I>
Problem is we can't make any assumptions about sysresetreq/vectreset
as per Spencer's quote.


&gt;&gt;<i> I guess this is what I was asking about - how common are the two?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> STM32 fully supports sysresetreq, lpc17xx does not, some stellaris
</I>&gt;<i> chips don't.
</I>
Thanks! So we must handle all variations.


&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe it makes the most sense to always require explicit reset
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> configuration in the config files.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This would make sense, but currently (check the other thread) I think 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;cortex-m3 reset_config&quot; takes priority over &quot;reset_config&quot; and that's
</I>&gt;<i> not the best solution...
</I>
I would agree with that.


&gt;<i> Do you propose separate cfg files for core and for implementation
</I>&gt;<i> (the latter would include the former)?
</I>
I think that makes sense, yes.


&gt;&gt;<i> It's totally possible that there is no applicable default for cm3 in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> general, then we just don't spec anything on that level, and we make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sure to add a check into openocd so that it screams at the user if no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reset config has been made, when cm3 is used.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This would be a good solution if &quot;reset_config&quot; would get priority over 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;cortex-m3 reset_config&quot; - I mean if hardware reset is available it
</I>&gt;<i> should be used in the first place, before resorting to soft-reset
</I>&gt;<i> methods.
</I>
Yes, but see later..


&gt;<i> Other option is to allow user to select, whether soft-reset method
</I>&gt;<i> available should be forced over hardware reset or not.
</I>
This is an interesting thought. I'm not sure if it would be useful,
but if there is plumbing in openocd to allow it and it could help
someone then why not.


&gt;<i> This reminds me about a proposal I made someday about configuration model 
</I>&gt;<i> in which user specifies the capabilities and OpenOCD uses the best common 
</I>&gt;<i> in case nothing is forced.
</I>
I agree completely that this is where we need to go. I fear that it
may mean a lot of changes in openocd though, so it will need small
steps and take some time.
