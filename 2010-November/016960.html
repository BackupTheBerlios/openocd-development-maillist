<PRE>Hi Igor and Laurent,

Thanks for responding.  I realised too late that -develop isn't the proper
list for this sort of questions.

Yes, but not on this chip, TMS320VC5501PGF, it needs TRST high to get
into the right mood/mode.

</I>
TI tic54x / tic55x too (like the one above).

</I>
What an interesting idea!  That is a very useful program to help out
if you don't know the system's JTAG connectors.  It might be a very nice
combo with the generic flash access I'm trying, although I cannot connect
the dots just yet.

&gt;<i> That said, a pull-down resistor should not prevent you from using the
</I>&gt;<i> pin. You just need to provide some voltage to override it.
</I>
I feel a bit hesitant to drive 0,27A into TRST :) but you are basically
correct, of course.

Yes, indeed.

&gt;<i> Using a pull-down to TRST is practiced to make sure the TAP go-and-stay

</I>&gt;<i> TI add pull-down on TRST on all their boards.
</I>
Yes, their chips then operate normally and are not influenced by the
EMU0 and EMU1 signals that might put the device in High-Z.

&gt;<i> But a 12 Ohm is a bit too smaller to strong !
</I>&gt;<i> Are you sure it is not 1K2 Ohm ?
</I>
Quite sure.

&gt;<i> If you have a Amontec JTAGkey or JTAGkey-2 you may drives TRST as 
</I>&gt;<i> push-pull or open-drain.
</I>
My Turtelizer2 is also open-drain, so it'll pull down from a pullup
resistor (that's what I had soldered on it for a previous PCB with
the same DSP chip).


Thanks,
 -Rick
