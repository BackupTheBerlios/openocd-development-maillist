How is going on SWD support?

No changes since my last update; I was
getting ready to merge the framework code when
the merge of the new Jim code made everything
break for me.  I've not yet had time to go back
and unbreak things.

Plans are still:  (i) merge framework code first,
hold the FT2232/Luminary driver code till later.


The framework changes haven't affected much of
the non-SWD code, but merging it sooner will help
avoid future conflicts.  The Luminary driver still
needs testing time from me, which has gotten harder
to come by this month due to other work.

  I think I'll at least post that code near the
time I merge the framework code, since I'll have
at least tested its initialization by then, and
have a handle on where the real bugs are.  I'm not
keen on posting very buggy code, and at this
point that driver is only compile tested.  (I think
some of that code might work for other FT2232
based hardware

(And as a reminder:  I did post a version of the
framework code a few months back, so it should
have no surprises for anyone who's been tracking
my posts on SWD topics.



Does the FT-based driver for SWD implemented?
I think the driver should be implemented first, so that other code and test can proceed.

Yes, see above.  Testing time remains the issue;
that driver code was written last summer.
 
I also have other stuff consuming my time.  (One
thing being a need to recover from the new Jim
code having merged (and broken my devel setup).

Turns out also that JLink published some docs,
but they seem limited to memory-based access,
which is only part of the SWD story ... and I've
not yet made time to think about how that kind of
SWD access will behave for us.  (That is, it's
less capable than JTAG or the FT2232/Luminary type
of driver (Or what I think Versaloon can do).  Doc
URL is now in the JLink driver; see GIT history.


It was said that the milestone
 for next release is SWD support, so probably we'll 

&quot;The&quot; milestone?  Maybe &quot;A&quot; goal among many.

have to wait a long time to see it ;( As you see (probably) nothing is going on in this matter...

If you think that, you've not bothered to read any
of my status reports.
