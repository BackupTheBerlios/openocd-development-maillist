Yeah, makes sense.

Can you say more about them? Did you study the SVF output by
FlashPro? It would be interesting to diff a failing SVF with a
working one.


&gt;<i> Some software like UrJtag ignores these commands if they even exist

I think this is the only sensible behavior.


&gt;<i> The svf player in openocd doesn't have anything like this (and I don't

</I>
Or maybe OpenOCD can patch in the neccessary stuff into the SVF?

3 minutes is also really slow imo, but it is what it is because of
how the simple interfaces work. I've ranted enough about that before.


&gt;<i> The basic openocd command then for me are simply:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> source [find interface/luminary-icdi.cfg] &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;#

</I>&gt;<i> init
</I>&gt;<i> scan_chain
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; # just to be sure they're connected properly
</I>&gt;<i> svf Chain_PROGRAM_ARRAY.svf quiet &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  # runs my
</I>&gt;<i> svf file from flashpro
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and it sits there quietly for just over 3 minutes before informing
</I>&gt;<i> me it's all done nicely, and I have a working fpga!
</I>&gt;<i> When I get a chance I'll make a patch/updates to the wiki page on
</I>&gt;<i> the svf player to be a bit more explicit on how to use it.
</I>
Thanks! Maybe another option would be for you to just submit a patch
with the above board file for your board, with some comments in it?
