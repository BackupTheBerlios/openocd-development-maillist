Yeah I'm much happier allowing previous syntax to work fine without
modification. I haven't looked at the xsvf module at all, while it
would be neater to bring it in line with this one, or even roll both
of them rolled together, I don't have any xilinx parts or software so
haven't had any call to use it. The xsvf parser or format may very
well have chain functionality built into it, I'm not sure.

Well I've made a whole heap more updates, and eventually realised I
should be splitting them up into separate patches, as many of them are
(or should be) somewhat independent. That was a bit of a hassle, but
it's neater this way.... as well as being openocd policy from what
I've read.

svf_chain_cmd_parser.patch : Main patch, chain tap handling and
updated command parser, mostly the same as earlier submitted patch.
svf_file_handling.patch: converts file handling from open to fopen
etc. Also input files are read as whole lines before parsing.
Debatable whether this is neater code, but it does result in 10% speed
improvement for me, and should be more portable.
svf_progress_indicator.patch: Adds progress indicator (xx% readout)
when (-)progress flag added to command line. this works in both quiet
and non-quiet modes. This patch is dependent on
svf_file_handling.patch being previously applied.
svf_time_output_format.patch: time taken readout at end of svf
operation converted from direct ms output to minutes-seconds-ms output
for better readability.

I've used this newer version to program my a3p125 and a3p060 parts on
identical chains with lpc3131 multiple times with different flags and
haven't had any problems.

One significant finding is the time difference when non-quiet
(default) mode is used, particularly on windows the verbose output
slows the overall operation down a _lot_. I'm talking 1mins 19sec for
quiet compared to 6mins 40sec on verbose. The time difference on linux
was much much less severe but I haven't tested it with the full length
file, but but on a much shorter test file it was a difference of 8
seconds to 14 seconds. The programming works fine either way, just
printing the lines takes some time. This slow file is ~290,000 lines
of svf, so not surprising that it takes some time to print all this to
console.
