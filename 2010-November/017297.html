I agree on that. Still I think it should be tested more. For example the problems I currently have on Mac OS should be resolved before a point release is done? But in general there should be regular point releases with bugfixes, additional scripts and so on. So that distributions like Debian can update their packages and contain all the small fixes and scripts for everyone to use easily. Otherwise the maintainers will fall back to the earlier mode, where they were packaging some arbitrary git revisions, to provide the users with a slightly more up to date version of openocd. Major features always need a long time and should be released in their own pace.

Cheers Esden
