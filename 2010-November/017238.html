&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yep I rewrote the command line parser, so the usage is now:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;usage: svf [-tap device.tap] [-quiet] &lt;file&gt;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Arguments are checked in a loop so it will accept switches and &lt;file&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> in any order. quiet or -quiet are both recognised. And of course, -tap
</I>&gt;<i> is optional. As such it is now back compatible, much nicer and more
</I>&gt;<i> flexible. There's also a help switch that simply prints usage in case
</I>&gt;<i> anyone tries it.
</I>
As someone who has previously used svf and xsvf functionality with
chained devices I'd like to add another 'yes please this is great'
vote, and thank andrew for his work (I'm glad someone understands
this stuff :-)

Oddly I have previously found that xsvf files would work even when
they were generated single but used in a chain (or maybe it was the
other way round). I was quite suprised about this and assumed that
openocd was already doing something clever equivalent to the
functionality this patch provides. But obviously that was just dumb
luck.

And yes the above syntax is the right way tto do this. Breaking
existing scripts is something we should work hard to avoid as it can
make openocd updates in production environments very awkward.. 

Wookey
