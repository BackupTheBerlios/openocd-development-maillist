That makes sense.

</I>
Not a big problem since there is a) lots of RAM in PCs and b) a
well-defined failure mode in (rare) case of memory pressure.
I agree conservative is good, but allocation is also slow, and in
for a handful of bytes I think it is an easy tradeoff.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; + &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; sprintf(svf_command_buffer, &quot;STATE RESET &quot;);

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
The point of snprintf() is that it will never write beyond the given
buffer size, yet always terminate the string with a \0. The return
value can be used to check if the buffer was large enough. This works
together to avoid possible buffer overrun conditions, which are quite
frequently exploited to inject code via data, and break security of
the program or product.


&gt;<i> &gt; will svf_run_command() take a const char[]? Then just do:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; svf_run_command(CMD_CTX, &quot;STATE RESET&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> they resulted in a smiley face character being printed on console
</I>&gt;<i> and system beep
</I>
Unfortunately changing svf_run_command() would not be a simple task,
it first tokenizes the input string into an array, then it also makes
some further modifications within the input command string..


&gt;<i> &gt; reuse .. existing handling of head/tail
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> looks like maybe it'll be quite straightforward.
</I>
.. but it looks like we can ignore that for now thanks to your other
changes. Great!

(A note that you can send patches easily by first committing and then
using the git send-email command.)


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; usage: svf [-tap device.tap] &lt;file&gt; [quiet]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yep I rewrote the command line parser, so the usage is now:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;usage: svf [-tap device.tap] [-quiet] &lt;file&gt;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Arguments are checked in a loop so it will accept switches and &lt;file&gt;

</I>&gt;<i> is optional. As such it is now back compatible, much nicer and more
</I>&gt;<i> flexible. There's also a help switch that simply prints usage in case
</I>&gt;<i> anyone tries it.
</I>
Good stuff! I just have one very minor request for the help text:

usage: svf [[-]help] [-tap device.tap] &lt;file&gt; [[-]quiet]

If [-]help is common in other commands then it is good to have here,
but otherwise I think it might be redundant. If I just enter svf
(without further options) then I will get the same output, right?

Also, I'd like quiet to still be at the end, to signal a little more
that this is still backwards compatible.

Are you sure about the dash in -quiet?

I would feel best about this:

usage: svf [-tap device.tap] &lt;file&gt; [quiet]

Because quiet can be treated specially, and it is even possible to
reliably allow a -tap filename by careful evaluation of the
arguments. I would be happy to make this change if you're OK with
that.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; reuse .. existing handling of head/tail
</I>..
&gt;<i> I dug deep enough to figure out how it works, it uses array's that it
</I>&gt;<i> dynamically sets the size of, so it's a little convoluted to set them.
</I>
I'd like to suggest a function to handle the setting, see below.


&gt;<i> It's debatable whether this newer code is neater to understand, but
</I>&gt;<i> it is certainly far more efficient to run, and avoids all the extra
</I>&gt;<i> string handling.
</I>
I like the new approach very much!


&gt;<i> Other than that it seems to run fine, I've tested the command line in
</I>&gt;<i> pretty much every direction and it works well. The operation of
</I>&gt;<i> header/trailer padding certainly seems to be completely compatible
</I>&gt;<i> with my first effort, I don't think I've missed anything of left out
</I>&gt;<i> any important steps.
</I>
Lovely.


&gt;<i> +static int svf_adjust_array_length(uint8_t **arr, int orig_bit_len, int new_bit_len, int set);
</I>
I would suggest adding a function with a new name that takes the
extra parameter, and renaming the existing function, and adding the
parameter to it. Then add a one-line function with the original name
that calls the new function with the last parameter set to 0. This
way, each previous call site for the existing function does not need
to be touched by this patch. The new call sites invoke the renamed
function and specify values as needed for the extra parameter.


&gt;<i> +		else if ((svf_fd = open(CMD_ARGV[i], O_RDONLY)) &lt; 0)
</I>&gt;<i>  		{
</I>&gt;<i> -			LOG_ERROR(&quot;unknown variant for svf: %s&quot;, CMD_ARGV[i]);
</I>&gt;<i> -
</I>&gt;<i> +			command_print(CMD_CTX, USAGE);
</I>&gt;<i> +			command_print(CMD_CTX, &quot;file \&quot;%s\&quot; not found&quot;, CMD_ARGV[i]);
</I>
I know this was already in here before, but open() can fail for many
reasons. It would be nice to not assume that the file is missing, and
e.g. call strerror() to get the specific error message:

else if ((svf_fd = open(CMD_ARGV[i], O_RDONLY)) &lt; 0)
{
  int err = errno;
  LOG.. 
  print usage ..
  command_print(CMD_CTX, &quot;open(\&quot;%s\&quot;): %s&quot;, CMD_ARGV[i], strerror(err));

Also, I'm surprised that open() is used instead of fopen(), but that
doesn't matter as long as this works. Are you testing on a Windows or
Linux system?


&gt;<i> +		// HDR %d TDI (0) 
</I>&gt;<i> +		error |= svf_adjust_array_length(&amp;svf_para.hdr_para.tdi, svf_para.hdr_para.len, header_dr_len, 0);
</I>&gt;<i> +		error |= svf_adjust_array_length(&amp;svf_para.hdr_para.tdo, svf_para.hdr_para.len, header_dr_len, 0);
</I>&gt;<i> +		error |= svf_adjust_array_length(&amp;svf_para.hdr_para.mask, svf_para.hdr_para.len, header_dr_len, 0);
</I>&gt;<i> +		svf_para.hdr_para.len = header_dr_len;
</I>&gt;<i> +		svf_para.hdr_para.data_mask = XXR_TDI;	
</I>
Watch out for trailing whitespace, in the last line quoted above.

These blocks of code are somewhat repetitive, maybe they could be
refactored into a nice function:

unsigned int set_xxr_para(struct svf_xxr_para *p, unsigned int len, unsigned char tdi) {
  int ret = 0;
  ret |= svf_adjust_array_length(&amp;p-&gt;tdi, p-&gt;len, len, tdi);
  ret |= svf_adjust_array_length(&amp;p-&gt;tdo, p-&gt;len, len, 0);
  ret |= svf_adjust_array_length(&amp;p-&gt;mask, p-&gt;len, len, 0);
  p-&gt;len = len;
  p-&gt;data_mask = XXR_TDI;
  return ret;
}

The blocks would then become:

  error |= set_xxr_para(&amp;svf_para.hdr_para, header_dr_len, 0);
  error |= set_xxr_para(&amp;svf_para.hir_para, header_ir_len, 0xff);
  error |= set_xxr_para(&amp;svf_para.tdr_para, trailer_dr_len, 0);
  error |= set_xxr_para(&amp;svf_para.tir_para, trailer_ir_len, 0xff);


&gt;<i> -static int svf_adjust_array_length(uint8_t **arr, int orig_bit_len, int new_bit_len)
</I>&gt;<i> +static int svf_adjust_array_length(uint8_t **arr, int orig_bit_len, int new_bit_len, int set)
</I>
Right, please do change the name of the function as mentioned above.
I think it's fairly important that all existing call sites do not
have to change, when they are not really relevant for this change.


&gt;<i>  	case HDR:
</I>&gt;<i> +		if (svf_tap_is_specified)
</I>&gt;<i> +			break;
</I>&gt;<i>  		xxr_para_tmp = &amp;svf_para.hdr_para;
</I>&gt;<i>  		goto XXR_common;
</I>
Maybe add a message when breaking here, so that the user is informed
why the commands in the file are being ignored? I'm not sure.


Really good stuff!
