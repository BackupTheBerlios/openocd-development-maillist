For me such situations are almost impossible, but some strange and 
bizarre policy makes default target file for stm32 tell OpenOCD there is 
no reset at all...

Of course user can change that, but with this assumption, target, board 
and interface cfg files can as well be deleted, as the user can write 
his/her own... Number of things that users of OpenOCD have to do prior 
to using it for it's main purpose tends to grow, rather than shrink...

I (and many other people) like to use OpenOCD with just command-line 
parameters, like this:
openocd -f interface/... -f target/...
It worked fine, and that was very cool, because one does not need to 
prepare millions of config files for each project / occasion. Now with 
this method peripherals are NOT reset during &quot;reset ...&quot; command on 
stm32... I know what to do to fix this, but I bet 95% of OpenOCD users 
don't. You can decide that it's their problem if you want. The files in 
target directory are soon going to be useless alone.

Completely off-topic: sometimes I think, that open-source projects are 
just a cover-up made by people working for big companies - they ensure 
that the software works, but is impossible to use without reading the 
manual twice, browsing through the mail archives, searching the web for 
half a day and then reading the manual again... Then they find out that 
this &quot;problem&quot; they have is a &quot;policy&quot; and that it will never be 
changed, because someone decided that it's the right way to go.

&gt;&gt;<i> If SRST is available, no soft-reset is required.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course. What decides on the code path?
</I>
I don't understand the question, so here is a blind answer...
1. no chip resets, no cortex-m3 reset method specified - use SYSRESETREQ 
(now use VECTRESET - does not reset peripherals)
2. chip reset available, cortex-m3 reset method specified - use 
cortex-m3 reset method that was specified
3. chip resets available, no cortex-m3 reset method specified - use SRST
4. no chip resets, cortex-m3 reset method specified - use it, but if 
cortex-m3 reset method is SRST that will be changed to SYSRESETREQ (now 
it will be changed to VECTRESET, note as in 1.)

4\/3!!
