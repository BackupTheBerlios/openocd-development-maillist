I cannot agree, as there were many discussions about whether 
reset_config should be placed in target file. For me it should, but for 
the majority of OpenOCD maintainers it shouldn't and it won't be.

&gt;&gt;<i> Number of things that users of OpenOCD have to do prior to using it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for it's main purpose tends to grow, rather than shrink...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe things need to get a little worse before they can get a lot

</I>
Sure, but every maintainer has different opinion on what is &quot;right&quot; and 
what is &quot;better&quot;, that's why nothing get's changed and the status quo 
will be here forever.

IMO haveing target file for every supported chip (my recent proposal) is 
very good and _very_ user-friendly, I offered to do that, but 
maintainers were not interested, so this mix of family-generic (stm32, 
stellaris) and target-specific (lpc2103, lpc2148, at91sam7sx, 
at91sam7se, ...) files will probably be here forever.

&gt;&gt;<i> Completely off-topic: sometimes I think, that open-source projects
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are just a cover-up made by people working for big companies
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, this is a bit silly. I can understand that open source
</I>&gt;<i> projects are immensely frustrating if there is some kind of
</I>&gt;<i> incompatibility, be it attitude or philosophy or even trivial
</I>&gt;<i> stuff like coding style.
</I>
This things may seem trivial, but imagine that someone produces a patch 
that adds functioning support for SWD in OpenOCD and that will not be 
accepted, because the lines are too long...

&gt;<i> And the fact that projects to a high degree are based on voluntary
</I>&gt;<i> contributions means that it can be basically impossible to get
</I>&gt;<i> something done the way you like unless you do it yourself. I am not
</I>&gt;<i> complaining that *you* do not contribute here, I mean this completely
</I>&gt;<i> generally.
</I>
Agreed, that's obvious, and no one is forcing any of the maintainers to 
implement someones requests.

&gt;<i> I also completely understand that not everyone can do the changes
</I>&gt;<i> themselves, but it's also important to remember that those who
</I>&gt;<i> selflessly do want to contribute code changes that will help others
</I>&gt;<i> have very limited resources, so it might take time.
</I>
We can get back to my previous point. If that &quot;someone&quot; had produced a 
monolithic SWD patch, that would also not be accepted, because changes 
should be incremental, easy, isolated, and so on. But imagine how this 
contributor would feel when he/she would be told to spend another 100 
hours on refactoring the patch that took hin'her 100 hours. I would 
probably just write &quot;love or leave&quot;...

&gt;<i> Just remember that this is really just piece of sh*t software that we
</I>&gt;<i> are hacking on to make it do a decent job. It is still good enough to
</I>&gt;<i> sell products based on, and sometimes it's many many times better
</I>&gt;<i> than proprietary products, but it is still not that amazing. Very
</I>&gt;<i> little software is. Fixing that is of course a huge task, but we all
</I>&gt;<i> want to make things better and try to help as best we can.
</I>
It's not that I don't like OpenOCD, but how is it better than commercial 
software that allows one to start debug session in 3 clicks (select 
target model, select debugger, click connect)? This attitude may seem a 
bit negative, but believe me, that it's exact same attitude that a 
typical newcomer to ARM's world shows.

&gt;<i> Sorry, it was unclear. I meant to ask how openocd knows to use SRTS
</I>&gt;<i> or soft-reset and if soft-reset then how it knows to use SYSRESETREQ
</I>&gt;<i> or VECTRESET. I guess it's all target and board config files.
</I>
Clarification:
standard command &quot;reset_config&quot; can define that there are resets present 
or not. Default is &quot;none&quot; and that is assumed when no &quot;reset_config&quot; 
command is present.
new command &quot;cortex-m3 reset_config&quot; can define reset method for 
Cortex-M3 core - srst (real reset, only if the signal is available, so 
&quot;reset_config srst&quot; is required), sysresetreq (almost-real-reset - 
resets peripherals) or vectreset (soft-reset that does not reset 
peripherals).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so here is a blind answer...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. no chip resets, no cortex-m3 reset method specified - use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SYSRESETREQ (now use VECTRESET - does not reset peripherals)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. chip reset available, cortex-m3 reset method specified - use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cortex-m3 reset method that was specified
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What cm3 reset method would that be, for example? C code in OpenOCD?
</I>
case 1 is when OpenOCD receives neither &quot;reset_config&quot; nor &quot;cortex-m3 
reset_config&quot;.
case 2 is when OpenOCD reveives &quot;reset_config srst / srst_and_trst&quot; and 
&quot;cortex-m3 reset_config srst / sysresetreq / vectreset&quot; - chip would be 
reset with a method specified with the latter.

&gt;&gt;<i> 3. chip resets available, no cortex-m3 reset method specified - use SRST
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok.
</I>
case 3 is when OpenOCD reveives &quot;reset_config srst / srst_and_trst&quot; but 
no &quot;cortex-m3 reset_config ...&quot; - normal reset signal is asserted.

&gt;&gt;<i> 4. no chip resets, cortex-m3 reset method specified - use it, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if cortex-m3 reset method is SRST that will be changed to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SYSRESETREQ (now it will be changed to VECTRESET, note as in 1.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Uh? So the cm3 reset method is not in C, but can be set to SRST?
</I>
case 4 is when OpenOCD reveives &quot;reset_config none&quot; (or no 
&quot;reset_config&quot; command) and &quot;cortex-m3 reset_config srst / sysresetreq / 
vectreset&quot; - srst is impossible and it will be changed to sysresetreq 
(with my patch) or vectreset (current code), the chip will be reset 
using software methods.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I still believe the best way is for each core to state that it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> supports SYSTEMRESET over VECTRESET in the cfg file.
</I> &gt;
&gt;<i> I guess this is what I was asking about - how common are the two?
</I>
STM32 fully supports sysresetreq, lpc17xx does not, some stellaris chips 
don't.

&gt;<i> Maybe it makes the most sense to always require explicit reset
</I>&gt;<i> configuration in the config files.
</I>
This would make sense, but currently (check the other thread) I think 
&quot;cortex-m3 reset_config&quot; takes priority over &quot;reset_config&quot; and that's 
not the best solution...

  &gt;&gt; LPC2xxx supposedly cannot be reset into halted mode (because SRST
&gt;&gt;<i> pulls TRST)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please *stop* adding to this misconception! I've had to patch both
</I>&gt;<i> lpc2148.cfg and lpc1768.cfg because someone apparently did not read
</I>&gt;<i> the chip PDFs before making or changing the config files. It's
</I>&gt;<i> nonsense.
</I>
This was meant only as an example of chip that somehow may violate ARM 
standard, and yet OpenOCD never assumed that as a default.

&gt;<i> The whole issue is really simple IMO; each &quot;level&quot; of config file
</I>&gt;<i> (cm3 vs. lpc1768, arm7 vs. lpc2148, etc) should reflect the accurate
</I>&gt;<i> settings for that level, and more specific files can override more
</I>&gt;<i> generic ones as neccessary.
</I>
Do you propose separate cfg files for core and for implementation (the 
latter would include the former)?

&gt;<i> It's totally possible that there is no applicable default for cm3 in
</I>&gt;<i> general, then we just don't spec anything on that level, and we make
</I>&gt;<i> sure to add a check into openocd so that it screams at the user if no
</I>&gt;<i> reset config has been made, when cm3 is used.
</I>
This would be a good solution if &quot;reset_config&quot; would get priority over 
&quot;cortex-m3 reset_config&quot; - I mean if hardware reset is available it 
should be used in the first place, before resorting to soft-reset 
methods. Other option is to allow user to select, whether soft-reset 
method available should be forced over hardware reset or not.

This reminds me about a proposal I made someday about configuration 
model in which user specifies the capabilities and OpenOCD uses the best 
common in case nothing is forced. For example interface cfg file states 
that max JTAG freq is 1MHz, target says that max JTAG freq is 0.5MHz, so 
use 0.5MHz. Interface has only SRST, target has correctly wired SRST and 
TRST, core supports srst and vectreset, so use SRST. If target would not 
have reset signals, vectreset would be used. You probably get the picture...

4\/3!!
