<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;/ By default OpenOCD should build the Jim Tcl submodule
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;&gt;/ automatically, but there should be an option to use the
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;&gt;/ installed Jim Tcl.
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ 
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ I disagree strongly with this.
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ 
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ Moving Jim out into a separate package means that it should also be
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ treated as a separate package. (Which it is, so it makes perfect sense!)
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ 
</I>&gt;<i> /
</I>&gt;<i> [snip lots of detail about building]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think all this misses the point that *right now* people are trying
</I>&gt;<i> to build openocd from git and failing. This means there is a problem
</I>&gt;<i> which needs to be fixed. I don't think telling people to go create
</I>&gt;<i> (.e.g.) cygwin projects to solve their problem is going to be popular.
</I>
Yes, you're right! 

By experience, 95% OpenOCD Windows users use cygwin to build their own openocd.exe for Windows. Then they use their openocd.exe on Windows System.
So, Cygwin is used in the build process only. For Linux and Mac the build process is a little bit easier, that's good.
But the advantage of Cygwin is to force us to learn more about dynamic / static dependency, since you build and use openocd server on two 'different' systems.

Also, a lot of users are building openocd from git now, since the release are too old -&gt; many improvements every days. Many new features every weeks.
But that's is not so bad, since more users are testing the last new features ...

Regarding TCL, it should be used as easy user interface only and not be used as algorithm description?

The other questions are : 
Does JimTCL mature enough to be extern to OpenOCD (get from git at any build)?
Does OpenOCD really will integrated the new features of JimTCL? 
Does the basic functions of actual JimTCL will suffice for 95% of our TCL task?
 

I am for having :
- the source of JimTCL in the git OpenOCD directory (some kB !!!)
- each release of OpenOCD has it own JIMTCL source release inside, 
- to never use JimTCL for any thing else than user interface.
- a review of all of this with a more mature JimTCL and a more mature openocd.
