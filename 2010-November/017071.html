I disagree strongly with this.

Moving Jim out into a separate package means that it should also be
treated as a separate package. (Which it is, so it makes perfect sense!)

I have added dev-lang/jimtcl and dev-embedded/openocd ebuilds to my
Gentoo Linux overlay, so you can build the latest openocd from git
easily using these commands, if you are running Gentoo:

# set up layman
emerge layman # and add the source line to /etc/make.conf per instructions
layman -a stuge

# permit git build of openocd
mkdir -p /etc/portage
echo 'dev-lang/jimtcl **' &gt;&gt; /etc/portage/package.keywords
echo 'dev-embedded/openocd **' &gt;&gt; /etc/portage/package.keywords

# install openocd from git (it pulls in jimtcl)
emerge =openocd-9999

(If you want to upgrade later, just run the last emerge again.)

My ebuilds here:
<A HREF="http://git.stuge.se/?p=stuge-overlay.git;a=blob;f=dev-lang/jimtcl/jimtcl-9999.ebuild">http://git.stuge.se/?p=stuge-overlay.git;a=blob;f=dev-lang/jimtcl/jimtcl-9999.ebuild</A>
<A HREF="http://git.stuge.se/?p=stuge-overlay.git;a=blob;f=dev-embedded/openocd/openocd-9999.ebuild">http://git.stuge.se/?p=stuge-overlay.git;a=blob;f=dev-embedded/openocd/openocd-9999.ebuild</A>

My jimtcl ebuild builds a shared library because I think that makes
the most sense.

Making the packages I noticed that the build infrastructure for Jim is
a little simpler than most other autotools packages, it has a
hand-made Makefile rather than an automake-generated one. In
particular the make install target doesn't work like others. There
are some hard coded paths here and there, which also makes it a bit
more difficult in general to install Jim into the system. But this
could probably be fixed fairly easily.

People can hopefully benefit from the ebuilds as well.

Anyway, my point is, install Jim like the independent package it is,
and let OpenOCD require Jim as normal, and all is fine.

For those who like Cygwin, it is my experience that it might be easy
to create a jimtcl package also in Cygwin, which openocd would depend
on, and all would be well.


&gt;<i> We have both capabilities, the master branch uses the installed Jim
</I>&gt;<i> Tcl, and a patch hardcodes building Jim Tcl. Now we just need the
</I>&gt;<i> two at the same time, which requires a bit of configure knowledge.
</I>
Please remember that, as I've pointed out before, an autotools
project build is not complete until *after* make install. IMO openocd
must not make assumptions about Jim beyond that it should be installed
in system directories, or that any required exceptional settings are
given to openocd configure, either via environment variables which is
very simple, or via a --with-jim-tcl=/wherever option.

I think it would be fine to not add such an option, and either
just require Jim to be installed in the system, or require the right
CFLAGS and LDFLAGS environment variables to openocd configure.
