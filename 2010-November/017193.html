Exactly. Every git working copy is a fully worthy repository clone.
(Hence the git clone command.)


&gt;<i> So far I'm just doing a git diff &gt; blah.patch
</I>
Which also works, but is not using many of the nice features of git.
For example you will need to commit in order to comfortably test
what someone else is doing when collaborating around the same change.

Start by configuring your name and email, and the mailing list
address, in the openocd git repository:

git config --global core.user 'Andrew Leech'
git config --global core.email <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">your at email.here</A>
git config sendemail.to <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">openocd-development at lists.berlios.de</A>

When working on the code, this is a process I like:

Run git add on files that have changed and should be commited.
Then run git commit to enter a commit message.

This creates a commit in your repository. The commit can be sent to
other repositories (git push, usually for small groups, or to a
personal public repository) or it can be saved into an email message
(git format-patch) or sent out as an email (git send-email).

Run each command with --help to learn more about them.

Continue working on files and then repeat the git add+git commit steps.

If the previous commit should be amended with the newly made changes,
then use git commit --amend. A commit different from the previous is
created, but it will *replace* the old one rather than follow after it,
in the repository history.

In order to combine incremental commits into one clean commit to be
sent as one patch, I strongly recommend the interactive rebase
functionality. (git rebase -i origin) But when only working on a
single commit and not wanting to save any intermediary steps, --amend
is sufficient, and simple.

Interactive rebase permits changing commit messages, changing commits,
and/or squashing two or more commits together into a single one.
Please do read git rebase --help for more information. (scroll to
INTERACTIVE MODE)

There's also a great book about git: <A HREF="http://www.progit.org/">http://www.progit.org/</A>

And of course the manual:
<A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html">http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html</A>

For some background on git in general, watch Linus' Tech Talk:

&gt;<i> I'm in no way certain about quiet having a dash, it just seems more
</I>&gt;<i> consistent to me to have all switches with a dash, more like standard
</I>&gt;<i> *nix programs. On the other hand it's also important to keep
</I>&gt;<i> consistency within openocd to try to make it easier to use.
</I>
The backwards compatibility is something I think is particularly
important, even if the SVF support is not the most frequently used
part of openocd.


&gt;<i> I'm also not too concerned whether -help stays in there, as as
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned yes usage gets printed if you have an incorrect command
</I>&gt;<i> line anyway. I'm not sure if help as a command is common in any
</I>&gt;<i> other modules. Either way I'm more than happy for you or anyone to
</I>&gt;<i> modify the command line layout / behavior to keep it relevant.
</I>&gt;<i> For now I've changed it to usage: svf [-tap device.tap] &lt;file&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> [quiet], I do think this looks cleaner.
</I>
That's really good. That means that the change has a minimal and
clean contact surface with everything previous.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; +static int svf_adjust_array_length(uint8_t **arr, int orig_bit_len, int new_bit_len, int set);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would suggest adding a function with a new name that takes the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; extra parameter, and renaming the existing function, and adding the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; parameter to it. Then add a one-line function with the original name
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that calls the new function with the last parameter set to 0. This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; way, each previous call site for the existing function does not need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to be touched by this patch. The new call sites invoke the renamed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; function and specify values as needed for the extra parameter.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Once again this was the way I was initially implementing it and it
</I>&gt;<i> gave some minor issues and I then thought it seemed wasteful to add
</I>&gt;<i> another function just to modify the functionality of an existing
</I>&gt;<i> function. But yeah, going and modifying all calls to an existing
</I>&gt;<i> function is pretty messy too.
</I>
Adding a function which is basically just a wrapper is admittedly a
little wasteful, but I think the benefit of keeping the change small
and clean is important enough to outweigh that waste. Your new
solution is even better though.


&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;command_print(CMD_CTX, &quot;open(\&quot;%s\&quot;): %s&quot;, CMD_ARGV[i], strerror(err));
</I>..
&gt;<i> Yeah that error reporting makes a lot of sense, added. Now if you
</I>&gt;<i> specify a folder rather than a file you get &quot;permission denied&quot;, much
</I>&gt;<i> better.
</I>
All right!


&gt;<i> I'm testing on Windows 7 (cygwin) x64 (x32 openocd binaries) and
</I>&gt;<i> haven't had any issues with the file open. I've got a linux vm I
</I>&gt;<i> could have a got at compiling it on, probably should give it a test.
</I>
If you like to, but I don't think it's needed. I was mostly worried
about how this would behave on Windows, and since you have tested
there I don't think the changes need more testing.


&gt;<i> &gt; Watch out for trailing whitespace, in the last line quoted above.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ah now I see what you mean about the trailing whitespace, I never
</I>&gt;<i> recognized this before. I think I've fixed it up, haven't noticed any
</I>&gt;<i> in the new patch.
</I>
git diff can colour code it's output, and make whitespace errors very
visible. The colouring works by default in Linux, but unfortunately
not in Windows. Maybe this is sufficient:

git config --global color.ui true
git config --global core.whitespace trailing-space,space-before-tab

Also make sure to let git know that it should not permit any Windows
line-endings into the codebase:

git config --global core.autocrlf true


&gt;<i> &gt; These blocks of code are somewhat repetitive, maybe they could be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; refactored into a nice function:
</I>..
&gt;<i> I also agree with this suggestion, and have rolled them into a neat
</I>&gt;<i> function that absorbs the &quot;modifying an existing function&quot; without
</I>&gt;<i> looking at all wasteful and I'm pretty happy with it.
</I>&gt;<i> Much easier to read and more target error messages now.
</I>
Great stuff.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &#160; &#160; &#160; case HDR:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; + &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; if (svf_tap_is_specified)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; + &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; break;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; xxr_para_tmp = &amp;svf_para.hdr_para;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; goto XXR_common;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe add a message when breaking here, so that the user is informed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; why the commands in the file are being ignored? I'm not sure.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I quite like this suggestion too, added. It now prints (skipped) after
</I>&gt;<i> header/trailer commands when not in quiet mode, as such:
</I>..
&gt;<i> SIR
</I>&gt;<i> ENDIR
</I>&gt;<i> HDR (skipped)
</I>&gt;<i> HIR (skipped)
</I>
I would like if it also mentioned that it skipped because of -tap,
but I'm not quite sure how to best do that within svf_run_command().


&gt;<i> Thanks again for the suggestions, it's helping me be a much neater
</I>&gt;<i> programmer!
</I>
Thanks for improving openocd!


&gt;<i> diff --git a/src/svf/svf.c b/src/svf/svf.c
</I>
I think this is commit material for the main codebase after one more
round of comments, at least as far as I'm concerned. Some things I
spotted just now, and one I saw before but forgot to mention:


&gt;<i> -#define SVF_NUM_OF_OPTIONS			1
</I>&gt;<i> +#define SVF_MIN_NUM_OF_OPTIONS			1
</I>&gt;<i> +#define SVF_MAX_NUM_OF_OPTIONS			4
</I>&gt;<i> +#define USAGE &quot;svf [-tap device.tap] &lt;file&gt; [quiet]&quot;
</I>
Maybe name this SVF_USAGE? Not very important, since this file is
only about the svf command anyway.


&gt;<i> -		command_print(CMD_CTX, &quot;usage: svf &lt;file&gt; [quiet]&quot;);
</I>&gt;<i> +		command_print(CMD_CTX, USAGE);
</I>
Note that this lacks the leading usage: text. But no problem, this
works:

		command_print(CMD_CTX, &quot;usage: &quot; USAGE);

(two string constants like these will simply be concatenated)


&gt;<i> +	for (unsigned int i = 0; i &lt; CMD_ARGC; i++) {
</I>&gt;<i> +		if (strcmp(CMD_ARGV[i], &quot;-tap&quot;) == 0)
</I>&gt;<i> +		{
</I>&gt;<i> +			tap = jtag_tap_by_string(CMD_ARGV[i+1]);
</I>
Here's the one I forgot to comment on. Please only do the above call
if i+1 &lt; CMD_ARGC, since openocd will likely crash otherwise, when
the following (invalid) command is given: svf -tap


&gt;<i> +		else if ((strcmp(CMD_ARGV[i], &quot;quiet&quot;) == 0) || (strcmp(CMD_ARGV[i], &quot;-quiet&quot;) == 0))
</I>
I'd like to only recognize the quiet keyword, and not even check for
the one with a leading dash, so that only very little changes in how
the command will behave. In fact, I think the very best would be to
avoid the loop, and check for the three components explicitly:

-tap device.tap (optional, but must come first)
filename (mandatory)
quiet (optional, but must come last)

Checking this strictly allows complete backwards compatibility, and
filenames quiet or -help will still be allowed, though they are
fairly bad filenames for anyone to use. :)


&gt;<i> +		else if ((strcmp(CMD_ARGV[i], &quot;help&quot;) == 0) || (strcmp(CMD_ARGV[i], &quot;-help&quot;) == 0))
</I>
Since it's removed from the usage I think it should also be removed
from the code.


&gt;<i> +		else if ((svf_fd = open(CMD_ARGV[i], O_RDONLY)) &lt; 0)
</I>..
&gt;<i> +			int err = errno;
</I>&gt;<i> +			command_print(CMD_CTX, USAGE);
</I>
			command_print(CMD_CTX, &quot;usage: &quot; USAGE);


&gt;<i> -	if ((svf_fd = open(CMD_ARGV[0], O_RDONLY)) &lt; 0)
</I>&gt;<i> +	
</I>&gt;<i> +	if (svf_fd == NULL)
</I>
Sorry, this isn't right. The fd is an int, open() returns &lt; 0 on
failure, but NULL is a void *, which normally is defined as 0. svf_fd
needs to be initialized to -1 in order to have a reliable test of
whether a file was successfully opened or not, and the condition here
chould then check if svf_fd == -1.


&gt;<i> +		command_print(CMD_CTX, USAGE);
</I>
Again the &quot;usage :&quot; string. It's frequent enough that I think it
makes sense to define a second USAGE variant which combines the
&quot;usage: &quot; string with the actual USAGE string.


&gt;<i> +static int svf_set_padding(struct svf_xxr_para *xxr_para_tmp, int length, unsigned char tdi)
</I>&gt;<i> +{
</I>&gt;<i> +	int error = ERROR_OK;
</I>&gt;<i> +	error |= svf_adjust_array_length(&amp;xxr_para_tmp-&gt;tdi, xxr_para_tmp-&gt;len, length);
</I>&gt;<i> +	memset(xxr_para_tmp-&gt;tdi, tdi, (length + 7) &gt;&gt; 3);
</I>
Nice solution with the memset() within this function. Please change &gt;&gt; 3
into / 8 though, it is slightly easier to read and the compiler will
do the optimization for us. A very minor detail is also that if
xxr_para_tmp would have a shorter name, maybe just para, then all
lines could make it in under 80 characters wide. 80 is in no way a
hard requirement, but it is the width of my windows, and maybe many
others, so I try to stay under 80 if I can.


&gt;<i> +	if (!svf_quiet)
</I>&gt;<i> +	{
</I>&gt;<i> +		if (skipped)
</I>&gt;<i> +		{
</I>&gt;<i> +			LOG_USER(&quot;%s (skipped)&quot;, svf_command_buffer);
</I>
So far there is only the -tap reason to skip a command, but perhaps
the flag should be named more specifically, like skipped_tap, and the
message could mention -tap somehow?


&gt;<i> +		.usage = &quot;[-tap device.tap] &lt;file&gt; [quiet]&quot;,
</I>
It would be nice to reuse the USAGE define here as well.


Thanks for your great improvements to this code!
