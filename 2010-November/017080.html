&gt;<i> Now with 
</I>&gt;<i> this method peripherals are NOT reset during &quot;reset ...&quot; command on

</I>&gt;<i> half a day and then reading the manual again... Then they find out that 
</I>&gt;<i> this &quot;problem&quot; they have is a &quot;policy&quot; and that it will never be 
</I>&gt;<i> changed, because someone decided that it's the right way to go.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>OpenOCD project was not started in this way. But it is close to become 
as you say.
Why the OpenOCD was a success,
- 1. open-source
- 2. easy to use to do BASIC debug
- 3. cheap hardware debug (USB JTAG)
- 4. easy to come in the project and add new features / patches ...

An important point is the &quot;BASIC debug&quot; - if you want to do more 
complexe debug you should buy something else DSRTEAM / KEIL / GREENHILLS ...

But the complex debug are only for the 1% of users, the 99% will use 
openocd or something like the excellent Rowley Crossworks ;-)

Now, OpenOCD is becoming more &amp; more difficult to build (with the 
dependency of external tools like JimTCL / for me it is not a good thing 
to have JimTcl as an external module -&gt; we will see more troubles in 
futures.) ... and more and more difficult to use with changing System 
Reset idea ....

If we do not keep the openocd Easy to use, we will certainly kill it, or 
we will just provide an Excellent Debug platform for some big company 
with more manpower, and some company not respecting open-source license !
my 2c.
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;/ If SRST is available, no soft-reset is required.
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ Of course. What decides on the code path?
</I>&gt;<i> /
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand the question, so here is a blind answer...
</I>&gt;<i> 1. no chip resets, no cortex-m3 reset method specified - use SYSRESETREQ 
</I>&gt;<i> (now use VECTRESET - does not reset peripherals)
</I>&gt;<i> 2. chip reset available, cortex-m3 reset method specified - use 
</I>&gt;<i> cortex-m3 reset method that was specified
</I>&gt;<i> 3. chip resets available, no cortex-m3 reset method specified - use SRST
</I>&gt;<i> 4. no chip resets, cortex-m3 reset method specified - use it, but if 
</I>&gt;<i> cortex-m3 reset method is SRST that will be changed to SYSRESETREQ (now 
</I>&gt;<i> it will be changed to VECTRESET, note as in 1.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4\/3!!
