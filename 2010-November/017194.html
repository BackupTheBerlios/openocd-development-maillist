Thanks for the git helper, that's a really concise overview of the diff usage.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consistency within openocd to try to make it easier to use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The backwards compatibility is something I think is particularly

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I agree on the backwards compatibility, hence I made the dash on quiet
optional, it accepts quiet and -quiet. But yeah it does look cleaner
with no dash I feel.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm also not too concerned whether -help stays in there, as as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mentioned yes usage gets printed if you have an incorrect command
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> line anyway. I'm not sure if help as a command is common in any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other modules. Either way I'm more than happy for you or anyone to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modify the command line layout / behavior to keep it relevant.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For now I've changed it to usage: svf [-tap device.tap] &lt;file&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [quiet], I do think this looks cleaner.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's really good. That means that the change has a minimal and
</I>&gt;<i> clean contact surface with everything previous.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; +static int svf_adjust_array_length(uint8_t **arr, int orig_bit_len, int new_bit_len, int set);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I would suggest adding a function with a new name that takes the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; extra parameter, and renaming the existing function, and adding the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; parameter to it. Then add a one-line function with the original name
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; that calls the new function with the last parameter set to 0. This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; way, each previous call site for the existing function does not need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to be touched by this patch. The new call sites invoke the renamed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; function and specify values as needed for the extra parameter.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Once again this was the way I was initially implementing it and it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gave some minor issues and I then thought it seemed wasteful to add
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> another function just to modify the functionality of an existing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> function. But yeah, going and modifying all calls to an existing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> function is pretty messy too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Adding a function which is basically just a wrapper is admittedly a
</I>&gt;<i> little wasteful, but I think the benefit of keeping the change small
</I>&gt;<i> and clean is important enough to outweigh that waste. Your new
</I>&gt;<i> solution is even better though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &#160;command_print(CMD_CTX, &quot;open(\&quot;%s\&quot;): %s&quot;, CMD_ARGV[i], strerror(err));
</I>&gt;<i> ..
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yeah that error reporting makes a lot of sense, added. Now if you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specify a folder rather than a file you get &quot;permission denied&quot;, much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All right!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm testing on Windows 7 (cygwin) x64 (x32 openocd binaries) and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> haven't had any issues with the file open. I've got a linux vm I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could have a got at compiling it on, probably should give it a test.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you like to, but I don't think it's needed. I was mostly worried
</I>&gt;<i> about how this would behave on Windows, and since you have tested
</I>&gt;<i> there I don't think the changes need more testing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Watch out for trailing whitespace, in the last line quoted above.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ah now I see what you mean about the trailing whitespace, I never
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recognized this before. I think I've fixed it up, haven't noticed any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the new patch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> git diff can colour code it's output, and make whitespace errors very
</I>&gt;<i> visible. The colouring works by default in Linux, but unfortunately
</I>&gt;<i> not in Windows. Maybe this is sufficient:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> git config --global color.ui true
</I>&gt;<i> git config --global core.whitespace trailing-space,space-before-tab
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also make sure to let git know that it should not permit any Windows
</I>&gt;<i> line-endings into the codebase:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> git config --global core.autocrlf true
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;<i> - &#160; &#160; if ((svf_fd = open(CMD_ARGV[0], O_RDONLY)) &lt; 0)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> +
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> + &#160; &#160; if (svf_fd == NULL)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, this isn't right. The fd is an int, open() returns &lt; 0 on
</I>&gt;<i> failure, but NULL is a void *, which normally is defined as 0. svf_fd
</I>&gt;<i> needs to be initialized to -1 in order to have a reliable test of
</I>&gt;<i> whether a file was successfully opened or not, and the condition here
</I>&gt;<i> chould then check if svf_fd == -1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yep I noticed this myself, it's getting fixed. I've also found
switching to fopen and improving the file read function has given a
slight (10%) speed improvement, so now NULL will be correct :)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> + &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; command_print(CMD_CTX, USAGE);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again the &quot;usage :&quot; string. It's frequent enough that I think it
</I>&gt;<i> makes sense to define a second USAGE variant which combines the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;usage: &quot; string with the actual USAGE string.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> +static int svf_set_padding(struct svf_xxr_para *xxr_para_tmp, int length, unsigned char tdi)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> +{
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> + &#160; &#160; int error = ERROR_OK;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> + &#160; &#160; error |= svf_adjust_array_length(&amp;xxr_para_tmp-&gt;tdi, xxr_para_tmp-&gt;len, length);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> + &#160; &#160; memset(xxr_para_tmp-&gt;tdi, tdi, (length + 7) &gt;&gt; 3);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nice solution with the memset() within this function. Please change &gt;&gt; 3
</I>&gt;<i> into / 8 though, it is slightly easier to read and the compiler will
</I>&gt;<i> do the optimization for us. A very minor detail is also that if
</I>&gt;<i> xxr_para_tmp would have a shorter name, maybe just para, then all
</I>&gt;<i> lines could make it in under 80 characters wide. 80 is in no way a
</I>&gt;<i> hard requirement, but it is the width of my windows, and maybe many
</I>&gt;<i> others, so I try to stay under 80 if I can.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> + &#160; &#160; if (!svf_quiet)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> + &#160; &#160; {
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> + &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; if (skipped)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> + &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; {
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> + &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; LOG_USER(&quot;%s (skipped)&quot;, svf_command_buffer);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So far there is only the -tap reason to skip a command, but perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> the flag should be named more specifically, like skipped_tap, and the
</I>&gt;<i> message could mention -tap somehow?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hmm, yeah I'll have a think about this one, I've damaged the output
here already somehow, it's only printing each lines' command and not
their arguments. I'll have to fix it too.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> + &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; .usage = &quot;[-tap device.tap] &lt;file&gt; [quiet]&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be nice to reuse the USAGE define here as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yeah I was thinking this too, just hadn't thought of rolling the whole
print usage line earlier into a define, doing this makes it neat
enough to just have the string here in one define, and the rest of a
print command as a second one.

I'm also most of the way through adding a progress output to svf too,
as another configurable option. I've found that when programming can
take a few minutes it's really nice to have an idea of how it's going.
But now I doubt I'll get much chance to finish it and the rest of
these suggestions until next week, I'll chime back in when they're
done.

Cheers,
Andrew
