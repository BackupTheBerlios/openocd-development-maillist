</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> One can also ponder why you need debug access to something molded in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> plastic... Wouldn't it be better to debug your application on a more
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> lab-friendly setup?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>        
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A production unit that is to be protected from the environment must be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> molded into something.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We would never use plastic in most application but the end result would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the same.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I do agree that molded in plastic is strange but what difference would it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make as for software is concerned?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> It's not the plastic mold that's strange, it's the desire to _debug_
</I>&gt;<i> software on a production unit, permanently sealed or not. Debugging is
</I>&gt;<i> software development, which is more comfortably done on a lab unit
</I>&gt;<i> which can be probed and measured (and, in the best of worlds,
</I>&gt;<i> preferably _before_ production even starts).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>

You didn't think this one thru. There is debugging during development 
but also during manufacturing.
Usually even when the package is sealed we leave connections for debugging.
What would you need to do if you have a recall of a product and you need 
to figure out what is wrong with your software?
It is not always a hardware issue where you just swap units.
Even in the cases where you have to disable jtag for units shipped it is 
nice to be able to debug with units almost identical to what is in the 
field.

We only debug on prototypes before the production cycle. Once units are 
in production prototypes cannot be used to debug. Also, the final debug 
phase is always done on production units since we need to work with the 
real stuff. If you need high security you need to disable jtag after all 
your test. It would then be impossible to debug returned units but you 
still have similar units where you could try to simulate the issues that 
occured in the field.

If you'd ever worked for the military you would realize that you need to 
have answers that the big brass will believe if you get a FUBAR or SNAFU.
