The first comment I have is that it would be good if a short
description of the purpose of the new function is added inside
the source code.

I assume that this function is designed as a convenience function
to skip the need to use the --source option or the
add_script_search_dir command when OpenOCD is built and started
directly in the source directory.

I am interested to know the target group for this function.

If it mainly is for the developers:
Then I question the gain of this function. I expect that the
--source option and the add_script_search_dir command work good
enough for them.
If it is determined that this function is really desired then
remember that it is quite common that developers build OpenOCD
in a directory separate from the source tree. I have myself three
different build directories that is configured from a single
source directory. One for Linux deployment, one for Linux
debugging and one for Windows deployment. The present patch do
not support this kind of setup. The patch could be modified so
the source code dir is stored at compile time and is added to
the search path with the tcl addition when the */src/openocd
pattern match. However the present patch can be seen as a first
step.

If it mainly is for the users that build OpenOCD them self:
This installation less build is a new may to deploy OpenOCD.
Is this something that we should promote?
I expect that it should be properly documented in the README
file. I think that it is unacceptable to expect that users
get awareness about this feature by accident.

In general, I think we should be careful with the additions of
small extensions that only are a convenience for some special
cases. One by one they may look like a good thing but I am
afraid that it in the long run can erode the maintainability
of the code.

Best regards
