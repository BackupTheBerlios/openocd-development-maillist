The only thing that comes to mind is checking to be sure that the
debug configuration settings are all referencing the new files in the
new project. On the main tab of debug configurations ensure the new
project is selected, and that the c/c++ application is set to the new
object file. Then on the startup tab that the image and symbols are
either set manually to the new one or to project binary (which has
just been checked).

And/or, if your object file is loaded with openocd (I load mine
through gdb) check that your openocd script is pointing to the new
object/bin file.

&gt;<i> I don't know how to get more info from gdb as to what is going on ..
</I>
Depends on whether the problem is arising from gdb or openocd. openocd
script can be changed to add --debug &lt;0-3&gt; to its command line.
For GDP I've got a &quot;verbose console mode&quot; checkbox on the Debugger tab
of debug configurations (just under the popup of protocol version)
that when enabled gives a heap of extra console output.

For reference I'm using Eclipse helios sr1 with GDB Hardware
Debugging, yagarto for gcc/gdb and git trunk openocd.

I know  what you mean about this being somewhat off topic, but I feel
your pain, there doesn't seem to be a particularly good place to
discuss issues relating to the overall open source toolchain setup.
Similarly I've got serious issues getting pipe openocd working
properly in helios. It'd be great to have running, but in the rare
configurations it actually connects to the target correctly, it debugs
(ie step, read regs, etc) at such an abysmally slow pace it's
unusable, whereas the traditional method of external tool openocd and
sockets works fine. This in on windows too, so it's quite possibly
just that pipes on windows are a bit of a hack? Either way I've given
up on pipe for now.
