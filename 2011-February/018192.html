</I>
I'm running:
Version: Helios Service Release 1
Build id: 20100917-0705

I highly suggest you update it, when I first tried the original Helios
it was so incredibly buggy I switched back to the previous release
until this update came out.
Also, are you using the GDB hardware debugging module to talk to
openocd (part of CDT) with it? (aka not something else like older
zylin... don't know if it's even possible with helios)
I'm using it in standard GDB Hardware Debugging Launcher mode (down
the bottom of the Debug Configurations window), not in DSF mode (I
assume you'll only get this choice if you've installed DSF stuff from
CDT as well). The verbose checkbox may have come with SR1, or with
this mode, I'm not entirely sure. Chances are it's a SR1 thing though.

&gt;<i> &#216;yvind, the command line doesn't crash .... so not sure what eclipse/gdb is

</I>&gt;<i> It seems my executable is the problem, because when I replace the &quot;good&quot;

</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> To duplicate the project, I just did a copy/paste within the eclipse IDE and
</I>&gt;<i> everything built ok .... really confused why this object file crashes the
</I>&gt;<i> debugger ..
</I>
With copying projects, I've done this a number of times myself - often
I forget to change the build directory in the project settings, and
while it looks like it's compiling fine, it's actually compiling the
old project still because it's pointing to that folder.
These days in the Project settings -&gt; C/C++ Build -&gt; Builder settings
I set the Build Directory to ${ProjDirPath} which removes this
problem. This is for a makefile based system, which I assume you're
using.
