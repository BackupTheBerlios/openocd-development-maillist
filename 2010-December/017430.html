</I>And everyone else can live with unreliable results? I don't like this

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And how often do you flash full 504kB? 100kB will take ~4s, so whats a
</I>&gt;<i> difference between ~4 and ~20 seconds? How about small program - 10kB?
</I>&gt;<i> In a day &quot;your way&quot; will give me maybe 1 free minute more. For me

</I>What's the purpose of using a 512KiB flash micro if you only need 50K?
Lots of applications *will* use big parts of the flash, and yes,
programming times *do* matter in my development cycle, especially if we
are talking 10s vs. 20s (and for no good reason!).

&gt;<i> And you won't have because world does not end on &quot;ready made boards&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> That's why people don't use them and that's why IMHO there is no point
</I>&gt;<i> in creating them. What's the point for a board config file if most of
</I>&gt;<i> the boards with small microcontrollers don't have any external ram,
</I>&gt;<i> fancy reset circuitry and anything unusual - normal target file works
</I>&gt;<i> just fine, and what's most important for me (and not only me!) is that
</I>&gt;<i> it works standalone - without anything more.
</I>Then let's provide a board config file that works fine on those barebone
applications where OpenOCD does not need to know anything beyond the CPU.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But most of all - this makes running OpenOCD with just command line
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> arguments impossible (openocd -f interface/sth.cfg -f
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> target/sth_else.cfg), as now you have to have your board config file.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Please - don't go this way.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Why would that be impossible? Who prevents you to use a script that sets
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *your* clock frequency and includes the target script?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You don't get my point. To run OpenOCD &quot;my way&quot; I don't need ANY
</I>&gt;<i> scripts beside standard target/interface files that come with OpenOCD.
</I>So what is the problem? Right now, you are using the LPC2478 target
config file. You could use some kind of &quot;lpc2478_std&quot; config file
instead - same amount of typing, same user experience, but those people
working with more complex boards will have the benefit of running at the
right clock speed.

&gt;<i> For this reply to be constrictive criticism, I suggest you leave 4MHz
</I>&gt;<i> default value in case no clock is specified.
</I>I am not sure if this is a good idea - users won't notice when they
forget to specify the clock speed in their board config files - after
all, it *is* a required parameter.

Let's just add a standard board config file that supplies the 4MHz default.

&gt;<i> I have a crazy idea - I think it is possible to measure frequency of
</I>&gt;<i> the external crystal (and check for it's existence) with simple code
</I>&gt;<i> using one timer. This way OpenOCD would work without specifying this
</I>&gt;<i> frequency. It could then - before programming - measure it (backup-ing
</I>&gt;<i> all settings of timer), switch PLL to max value (using external
</I>&gt;<i> crystal or internal resonator, also backup-ing all settings of clock
</I>&gt;<i> and PLL), flash, revert all changes made to clock, PLL and timer and
</I>&gt;<i> voila [; Problem gone
</I>Nice idea. However, that goes way beyond what is required right now to
get reliable programming at the maximum possible speed.

Also, will this work without a &quot;reset init&quot; to get the system into a
known state?
