I don't know how about you, but me (and 99% of &quot;normal users&quot;) &quot;reset 
halt&quot; the chip before programming - so it does run at 4MHz during 
programming.

&gt;&gt;<i> Debugging is negligibly faster when using high clock, flash
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> programming duration gain is probably also negligible (what's the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> difference between waiting for 20 seconds to waiting for 10 seconds?).
</I>&gt;<i> 10 seconds? 100% (as seen by the the lucky 10s user)? And by the way
</I>&gt;<i> this is unrealistic. The penalty is much higher!
</I>&gt;<i> At 72 MHz I can program the LPC2478 (504 KiB) in 14s with a simple JTAG
</I>&gt;<i> interface. I feel no urge to wait longer than that.
</I>
And how often do you flash full 504kB? 100kB will take ~4s, so whats a 
difference between ~4 and ~20 seconds? How about small program - 10kB? 
In a day &quot;your way&quot; will give me maybe 1 free minute more. For me that's 
not worth the trouble [; But that's not the main point...

&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway - I never enable PLL before flash programming, I bet that most
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;regular users&quot; also don't.
</I>&gt;<i> A classical chicken and egg case. We don't have good board scripts
</I>&gt;<i> especially for the LPC devices. That's why people don't use it.
</I>
And you won't have because world does not end on &quot;ready made boards&quot;. 
That's why people don't use them and that's why IMHO there is no point 
in creating them. What's the point for a board config file if most of 
the boards with small microcontrollers don't have any external ram, 
fancy reset circuitry and anything unusual - normal target file works 
just fine, and what's most important for me (and not only me!) is that 
it works standalone - without anything more.

&gt;&gt;<i> But most of all - this makes running OpenOCD with just command line
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> arguments impossible (openocd -f interface/sth.cfg -f
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> target/sth_else.cfg), as now you have to have your board config file.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Please - don't go this way.
</I>&gt;<i> Why would that be impossible? Who prevents you to use a script that sets
</I>&gt;<i> *your* clock frequency and includes the target script?
</I>
You don't get my point. To run OpenOCD &quot;my way&quot; I don't need ANY scripts 
beside standard target/interface files that come with OpenOCD.

For this reply to be constrictive criticism, I suggest you leave 4MHz 
default value in case no clock is specified.

I have a crazy idea - I think it is possible to measure frequency of the 
external crystal (and check for it's existence) with simple code using 
one timer. This way OpenOCD would work without specifying this 
frequency. It could then - before programming - measure it (backup-ing 
all settings of timer), switch PLL to max value (using external crystal 
or internal resonator, also backup-ing all settings of clock and PLL), 
flash, revert all changes made to clock, PLL and timer and voila [; 
Problem gone

4\/3!!
