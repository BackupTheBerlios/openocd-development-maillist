How can this be unreliable? LPC23xx/LPC24xx after reset use 4MHz 
internal clock. Doing &quot;reset halt&quot; sets that clock and prevents any code 
from changing that (let's not talk about broken cases, because a broken 
case can be found everywhere), so what's wrong with this approach?

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 10 seconds? 100% (as seen by the the lucky 10s user)? And by the way

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that's not worth the trouble [; But that's not the main point...
</I>&gt;<i> What's the purpose of using a 512KiB flash micro if you only need 50K?
</I>&gt;<i> Lots of applications *will* use big parts of the flash, and yes,
</I>&gt;<i> programming times *do* matter in my development cycle, especially if we
</I>&gt;<i> are talking 10s vs. 20s (and for no good reason!).
</I>
Why use big chip? LPC2478 has an LCD driver, and there is no chip with 
LCD driver that has less flash. Because for developement of the project 
you take big chip just-in-case, and choose right one (regarding flash 
size) for production when the code is ready. Anyway - we should be 
talking about the average size of the upload, and that's never 512kB - 
the code has to grow from 0 to this size during developement.

BTW - you use libusb of ftd2xx (if you use Windows and FT2232 based 
JTAG)? I'm asking because if waiting 10s is worth breaking 
configurations of OpenOCD's regular users, then I hope you use the 
fastest library for the process.

C'mon! 10s?! Don't read mailing lists and that will save you much more 
time (;

&gt;&gt;<i> And you won't have because world does not end on &quot;ready made boards&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's why people don't use them and that's why IMHO there is no point
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in creating them. What's the point for a board config file if most of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the boards with small microcontrollers don't have any external ram,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fancy reset circuitry and anything unusual - normal target file works
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just fine, and what's most important for me (and not only me!) is that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it works standalone - without anything more.
</I>&gt;<i> Then let's provide a board config file that works fine on those barebone
</I>&gt;<i> applications where OpenOCD does not need to know anything beyond the CPU.
</I>
But there's no point in having a &quot;board&quot; file that in reality is not for 
board but for target, that will do nothing more than include target 
file... What for? What does that make easier? If one has it's own board 
with some chip I don't think one would look for config scripts in board 
directory... I wouldn't. Please - try to make OpenOCD more 
user-friendly, not user-hostile!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But most of all - this makes running OpenOCD with just command line
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> arguments impossible (openocd -f interface/sth.cfg -f
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> target/sth_else.cfg), as now you have to have your board config file.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Please - don't go this way.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Why would that be impossible? Who prevents you to use a script that sets
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> *your* clock frequency and includes the target script?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You don't get my point. To run OpenOCD &quot;my way&quot; I don't need ANY
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scripts beside standard target/interface files that come with OpenOCD.
</I>&gt;<i> So what is the problem? Right now, you are using the LPC2478 target
</I>&gt;<i> config file. You could use some kind of &quot;lpc2478_std&quot; config file
</I>&gt;<i> instead - same amount of typing, same user experience, but those people
</I>&gt;<i> working with more complex boards will have the benefit of running at the
</I>&gt;<i> right clock speed.
</I>
The problem is that &quot;right now&quot; OpenOCD provides all I need, because 
there is no &quot;lpc2478_std&quot; config file, lpc2478.cfg works just fine - I 
(and anyone willing to use OpenOCD with that chip) would have to create 
it first. Same amount of typing and user experience? I doubt it - right 
now I don't need to know ANYTHING about tcl, OpenOCD's config files etc. 
They work out-of-the-box. People working with more complex boards are 
not forbidden to set right clock speed now. Actually I think they 
managed, because I've not seen any complaints...

&gt;&gt;<i> For this reply to be constrictive criticism, I suggest you leave 4MHz
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> default value in case no clock is specified.
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure if this is a good idea - users won't notice when they
</I>&gt;<i> forget to specify the clock speed in their board config files - after
</I>&gt;<i> all, it *is* a required parameter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's just add a standard board config file that supplies the 4MHz default.
</I>
In case of not-specifying that frequency there could be warning emitted 
from the config script. It's possible to emit error, so it's probably 
possible to emit a warning too. Or a scary message.

I've made a proposal to create target files for every chip that OpenOCD 
could support and organize them neatly in directories. This has a 
disadvantage of having hundreds of files. Your approach (having board 
file just because target file was made dependent on some parameters) 
creates a need for otherwise useless files...

&gt;&gt;<i> I have a crazy idea - I think it is possible to measure frequency of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the external crystal (and check for it's existence) with simple code
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using one timer. This way OpenOCD would work without specifying this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> frequency. It could then - before programming - measure it (backup-ing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all settings of timer), switch PLL to max value (using external
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crystal or internal resonator, also backup-ing all settings of clock
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and PLL), flash, revert all changes made to clock, PLL and timer and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> voila [; Problem gone
</I>&gt;<i> Nice idea. However, that goes way beyond what is required right now to
</I>&gt;<i> get reliable programming at the maximum possible speed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, will this work without a &quot;reset init&quot; to get the system into a
</I>&gt;<i> known state?
</I>
I was thinking about embedding that within OpenOCD's flash handling code 
specific for LPC, not in config files. Right now you have to supply that 
speed, with such wise flashing algorithm this parameter would be useless 
(could be provided, could be omitted - freq would be measured then).

4\/3!!
