<PRE>Hi Freddie,

</I>Incorrect. Yes, the chip starts from its 4 MHz oscillator, but what the 
clock frequency actually is by the time OpenOCD gets access is 
unpredictable.
If for instance the flash is empty, the device will enter ISP mode 
automatically. It will activate the PLL, and from then on run with 
14.748 MHz. When in this situation you program the flash with the clock 
parameter set to 4 MHz, the programming pulse will have a width of less 
than 30% of the required time. Might work, usually will, but is unreliable.

The clock parameter is vital for correct and reliable flash programming. 
It must be possible for the user to select the frequency that he is using.

&gt;<i> Debugging is negligibly faster when using high clock, flash 
</I>&gt;<i> programming duration gain is probably also negligible (what's the 
</I>&gt;<i> difference between waiting for 20 seconds to waiting for 10 seconds?).
</I>10 seconds? 100% (as seen by the the lucky 10s user)? And by the way 
this is unrealistic. The penalty is much higher!
At 72 MHz I can program the LPC2478 (504 KiB) in 14s with a simple JTAG 
interface. I feel no urge to wait longer than that.

&gt;<i> Anyway - I never enable PLL before flash programming, I bet that most 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;regular users&quot; also don't.
</I>A classical chicken and egg case. We don't have good board scripts 
especially for the LPC devices. That's why people don't use it.

&gt;<i> But most of all - this makes running OpenOCD with just command line 
</I>&gt;<i> arguments impossible (openocd -f interface/sth.cfg -f 
</I>&gt;<i> target/sth_else.cfg), as now you have to have your board config file. 
</I>&gt;<i> Please - don't go this way.
</I>Why would that be impossible? Who prevents you to use a script that sets 
*your* clock frequency and includes the target script?

Regards,
Rolf
