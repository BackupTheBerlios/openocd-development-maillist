When doing &quot;reset halt&quot; (which would halt the chip immediately after 
reset) the clock would be 4MHz.

Indeed - older LPCs don't work this way, because there is no internal 
oscillator. So why change lpc2478.cfg that CAN work with default value, 
and leave all older files that CAN'T?

I like that I can take my mind off firmware for a few seconds and trade 
a few words with a co-worker sitting next to me. Actually &quot;professional 
embedded development&quot; in here must not look like in your place - we're 
not racing for the fastest upload on the market, because the client 
probably would not care if you could deliver the product a few hours 
earlier due to these tremendous savings on upload time (;

&gt;&gt;<i> But there's no point in having a &quot;board&quot; file that in reality is not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for board but for target, that will do nothing more than include
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> target file... What for? What does that make easier? If one has it's

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more user-friendly, not user-hostile!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's the whole point of OpenOCD's layered config file approach.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you refuse to work with an LPC2138 device just because its target

</I>&gt;<i> board file here. And at the risk of repeating myself, the situation for
</I>&gt;<i> LPC23xx is the same.
</I>
I've stated on multiple occasions that for me this whole policy is wrong.

As for the second paragraph, you are wrong. All LPC2xxx target config 
files have that frequency embedded without possibility to change with 
some parameters in board config files and - somehow - people manage to 
use it without problems. And I like those files very much, because they 
work standalone, so in my favorite way.

&gt;&gt;<i> The problem is that &quot;right now&quot; OpenOCD provides all I need, because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there is no &quot;lpc2478_std&quot; config file, lpc2478.cfg works just fine - I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (and anyone willing to use OpenOCD with that chip) would have to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> create it first. Same amount of typing and user experience? I doubt it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - right now I don't need to know ANYTHING about tcl, OpenOCD's config
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> files etc. They work out-of-the-box. People working with more complex
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> boards are not forbidden to set right clock speed now. Actually I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think they managed, because I've not seen any complaints...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why can't you do with LPC2478 what you *must* do with LPC2148? I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> getting it.
</I>&gt;<i> We're talking about a three-liner: 1. your interface, 2. your clock
</I>&gt;<i> frequency, 3. your target.
</I>&gt;<i> That's clearly a no-brainer!
</I>
I don't have to do that with ANY LPC2xxx file now. You're wrong here, 
because all these target files have frequency embedded inside without 
any parameters.

Just for the record - typing names of 2 files in command line is 
more-no-brainer than creating a config file that includes them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I have a crazy idea - I think it is possible to measure frequency of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the external crystal (and check for it's existence) with simple code
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> using one timer. This way OpenOCD would work without specifying this
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> frequency. It could then - before programming - measure it (backup-ing
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> all settings of timer), switch PLL to max value (using external
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> crystal or internal resonator, also backup-ing all settings of clock
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and PLL), flash, revert all changes made to clock, PLL and timer and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> voila [; Problem gone
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Nice idea. However, that goes way beyond what is required right now to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> get reliable programming at the maximum possible speed.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Also, will this work without a &quot;reset init&quot; to get the system into a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> known state?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was thinking about embedding that within OpenOCD's flash handling
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> code specific for LPC, not in config files. Right now you have to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> supply that speed, with such wise flashing algorithm this parameter
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be useless (could be provided, could be omitted - freq would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> measured then).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Deep inside I have a feeling that this proposal is on a head-on
</I>&gt;<i> collision course with your wish for simplicity...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Technically, I do not know how you want to measure frequency without a
</I>&gt;<i> timing reference.
</I>&gt;<i> And why on earth would I *temporarily* enable the PLL to circumvent the
</I>&gt;<i> difficulty of enabling the PLL at all?
</I>&gt;<i> I'm lost.
</I>
The idea with timers was wrong, but I've come with even simpler one. A 
simple algorithm is being executed on the chip (count++;) after some 
time (say 10ms) you halt it and check the value of count which gives you 
an estimate of frequency the core is running at.

How can &quot;not-requiring a parameter&quot; be more complicated than &quot;requiring 
it&quot;? Deep inside OpenOCD is complicated way beyond that.

Why enable and then disable. Because I want the chip to be in an 
after-reset state after flashing - I thought that's obvious. Having PLL 
enabled after flashing has completely NO advantage and possible problems 
with user code.

4\/3!!
