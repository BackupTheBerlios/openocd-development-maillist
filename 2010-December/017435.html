&gt;<i> How can this be unreliable? LPC23xx/LPC24xx after reset use 4MHz

</I>So flashing is only supported after &quot;reset halt&quot;? That adds another step
during development in case I work with different clock settings. That's
what I meant by &quot;broken&quot;: flashing does not work until I bring the board
into some configuration (reset halt) that is different from what I
normally need.

&gt;<i> Why use big chip? LPC2478 has an LCD driver, and there is no chip with

</I>&gt;<i> developement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW - you use libusb of ftd2xx (if you use Windows and FT2232 based
</I>&gt;<i> JTAG)? I'm asking because if waiting 10s is worth breaking
</I>&gt;<i> configurations of OpenOCD's regular users, then I hope you use the
</I>&gt;<i> fastest library for the process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> C'mon! 10s?! Don't read mailing lists and that will save you much more
</I>&gt;<i> time (;
</I>It's not about the total amount of time, it is about interrupting my
work on every upload.

Now how is the operating system I use relevant for this discussion? Just
because some things in OpenOCD might be improved does not mean that we
should slow down other operations as well - for no benefit, just because
you declare that it should be &quot;good enough&quot; for everyone.
Then let's provide a board config file that works fine on those barebone
&gt;&gt;<i> applications where OpenOCD does not need to know anything beyond the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> CPU.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But there's no point in having a &quot;board&quot; file that in reality is not
</I>&gt;<i> for board but for target, that will do nothing more than include
</I>&gt;<i> target file... What for? What does that make easier? If one has it's
</I>&gt;<i> own board with some chip I don't think one would look for config
</I>&gt;<i> scripts in board directory... I wouldn't. Please - try to make OpenOCD
</I>&gt;<i> more user-friendly, not user-hostile!
</I>The config file you need *is* for a board, so it belongs in the board
directory. The LPC target alone can not know the clock used.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But most of all - this makes running OpenOCD with just command line
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> arguments impossible (openocd -f interface/sth.cfg -f
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> target/sth_else.cfg), as now you have to have your board config file.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Please - don't go this way.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Why would that be impossible? Who prevents you to use a script that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sets
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> *your* clock frequency and includes the target script?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You don't get my point. To run OpenOCD &quot;my way&quot; I don't need ANY
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> scripts beside standard target/interface files that come with OpenOCD.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So what is the problem? Right now, you are using the LPC2478 target
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> config file. You could use some kind of &quot;lpc2478_std&quot; config file
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instead - same amount of typing, same user experience, but those people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> working with more complex boards will have the benefit of running at the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> right clock speed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is that &quot;right now&quot; OpenOCD provides all I need, because
</I>&gt;<i> there is no &quot;lpc2478_std&quot; config file, lpc2478.cfg works just fine - I
</I>&gt;<i> (and anyone willing to use OpenOCD with that chip) would have to
</I>&gt;<i> create it first. Same amount of typing and user experience? I doubt it
</I>&gt;<i> - right now I don't need to know ANYTHING about tcl, OpenOCD's config
</I>&gt;<i> files etc. They work out-of-the-box. People working with more complex
</I>&gt;<i> boards are not forbidden to set right clock speed now. Actually I
</I>&gt;<i> think they managed, because I've not seen any complaints...
</I>Um - no. I proposed to add that file to OpenOCD, so no user would need
to learn TCL or write his own config file - just like it is now.


&gt;<i> I've made a proposal to create target files for every chip that
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD could support and organize them neatly in directories. This
</I>&gt;<i> has a disadvantage of having hundreds of files. Your approach (having
</I>&gt;<i> board file just because target file was made dependent on some
</I>&gt;<i> parameters) creates a need for otherwise useless files...
</I>It is not useless - it enables other board config files to specify the
real clock speed.
