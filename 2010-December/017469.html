I know what state the chip will be in - it is exactly the state which my 
startup code puts it into, so I can use the same state for flashing, 
without a need for an extra reset.

</I>
The PLL settings *do* belong in a board config file. The code that sets 
the PLL is not board-specific but CPU-specific, so it can be shared.

</I>
The term &quot;board&quot; refers to a CPU plus environment - even if you replace 
the physical &quot;board&quot; part with air.

You need at least some decoupling capacitors, and you need to wire-up 
the JTAG connector, which can be done in different ways (regarding reset 
signals), so there are multiple possible setups that require different 
configurations.
