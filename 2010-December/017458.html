<PRE>Definitely my last post on this thread.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>One last time. OpenOCD cannot halt an LPC2000 immediately after reset. 
It must let the CPU run, then try to gain control over the CPU as fast 
as possible. How fast it can do that depends on the JTAG clock and on 
delay settings.
By the time OpenOCD has taken control, the CPU may have entered ISP mode 
(it does that if the flash contains no user firmware). In that case the 
clock will be 14.748 MHz, and not 4 MHz anymore. If there is valid user 
firmware, this firmware may have set the PLL to any value you like, 
leaving you with an unknown clock frequency.

This process is not under your control. The only possible conclusion is 
that you cannot have knowledge of the CPU frequency even after reset halt.

As a side note: This is the reason why PLL initialization of an LPC2000 
device should first disconnect and disable the PLL before it 
configures/starts/connects it again. If the device runs standalone, this 
step is unnecessary (the PLL is off after reset). However, if you debug 
the application via JTAG, things are different: Your JTAG box may not be 
able to stop the CPU before the firmware starts the PLL. The debugger 
will then just set the program counter to 0, so that it *appears* to be 
the reset state. But it isn't. Running PLL initialization again on the 
now already connected PLL will let your system crash.

That's a fact which you should accept. Not only because I do indeed work 
for NXP.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Indeed - older LPCs don't work this way, because there is no internal
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> oscillator. So why change lpc2478.cfg that CAN work with default
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> value, and leave all older files that CAN'T?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No, the lpc2478.cfg *CANNOT* work with a default, because there is none.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You say there is none, I say there is. There's no way we can agree.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>If you follow the arguments above about clock frequency uncertainty, 
then with all due respect you cannot but agree :-)


&gt;&gt;<i> lpc2103.cfg: The clock frequency is hard-coded as 12 MHz.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So you're saying is that anybody using crystals of 10, 14.756, 16,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 18.432, 20, 24 MHz has to accept that flashing won't work for him?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Just because you don't mind failures here and then?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously this device cannot be used with 14.765 crystal because 
</I>&gt;<i> LPC2148 also cannot (see your paragraph above) - I don't know why is 
</I>&gt;<i> that, but if you say so...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I haven't said so.

I said that nobody will do it. The LPC2148 will only be used by people 
who want USB. That requires a 12 MHz crystal, 14.756 MHz will not work. 
Besides the general nonsense of default frequencies in all these files, 
I took this as an outstanding example of a config file that will fit 
*ZERO* real world applications.


&gt;<i> Changing these 5 numbers is pretty straightforward and people do that 
</I>&gt;<i> (as OpenOCD works for them). I do. And are you saying that programming 
</I>&gt;<i> flash with wrong speed causes it to fail LATER? Again - do you have 
</I>&gt;<i> some secret knowledge from NXP that general public doesn't?
</I>You do not want to write a 3-line board file to describe your 
application, but you do accept having to modify predefined files, with 
the risk that they get overwritten next time you update OpenOCD?
Are you teasing me?

This is not the place to teach you about flash technology. Just a simple 
reminder: Flash is an analog component. Not applying a proper 
programming pulse will leave a cell charged at only say 30%. Every flash 
cell loses charge over time, but while the correctly handled cell keeps 
its charge for 20 years, the incorrectly handled cell may already fail 
after a few months.

&gt;<i> Yes, this must be plain wrong, and you must be plain right, as the 
</I>&gt;<i> world is black and white. Ease of use does not matter, the most 
</I>&gt;<i> important thing is to be ultra-correct with everything. Do you 
</I>&gt;<i> actually care about the users, or maybe you're affiliated with Keil or 
</I>&gt;<i> IAR and your goal is to make using OpenOCD harder? 
</I>Let me quote Sergeant Hartman:
&quot;What is your major malfunction?&quot;

&gt;<i> Really - your change does nothing more than make OpenOCD harder to 
</I>&gt;<i> use, as everyone could change that frequency before that (and they 
</I>&gt;<i> did, as people were using OpenOCD successfully with those chips for a 
</I>&gt;<i> long time), but to do that no additional file was required.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again (and again) - default (whatever they may or may not be) values 
</I>&gt;<i> with warning for ALL LPC config files are GOOD. Adding &quot;board&quot; files 
</I>&gt;<i> with such default value is exactly the same as leaving default value 
</I>&gt;<i> inside target files. You loose nothing, we gain easy use and we are 
</I>&gt;<i> warned that this may fail in some way or another.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I'm sorry, but the fact that you don't use anything but 12 MHz crystals 
should not give direction for others.
