I don't know. But, generally, if I _can_ register the same handler
twice, I'd expect each registration to require a separate unregister
call. The actual call sites would have to be inspected before changing
this behavior, of course. There shouldn't be many of them, since the
bug has gone unnoticed for so long.

Two of them differ only in the callback signature, the third is very different.

There are several imaginable solutions. You could have the list
functions operate on a generic next pointer, included as the first
element of all specialized list types. Or the actual data could be
stored outside the list structure, with just a void pointer in it.
Both require some nasty casts. Neither is likely to be more clear and
concise than the duplicated code. Maybe if it was used in _ten_
places...
