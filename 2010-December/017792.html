Sorry Jon, I skipped your message since not involved in the subject.

I partially agree with Peter. The transistor can be used as a valid
voltage level shifter.

I've just checked the schematic of Flyswatter adapter. The nSRST part
is common with many JTAG adapters.
The main reason for using the transistor in these circuits is to build
a &quot;wired AND&quot;.
Wikipedia does not have a valid description for &quot;wired AND&quot; circuit,
but a reasonable one is available in
<A HREF="http://tams-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/applets/hades/webdemos/00-intro/03-stdlogic/wired-and.html">http://tams-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/applets/hades/webdemos/00-intro/03-stdlogic/wired-and.html</A>

On the target board, nSRST can have many sources, e.g.:
- reset button
- watchdog circuit
- power-good detector
- JTAG
All such sources have to be combined together in a single nSRST signal.
The role is: nSRST is high when all the reset sources are high too,
equivalent to the behaviour of the &quot;AND&quot; gate
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AND_gate">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AND_gate</A>
In this case, &quot;wired AND&quot; is a good replacement for the AND gate.

All the reset sources must have &quot;open collector&quot; output (&quot;open drain&quot;
in case of CMOS devices). It means their output can only be either at
low level or left floating.
On the target board there must be one passive pull-up, a resistor to
Vcc, that provides the high level when all the sources are floating.

Best Regards,
Antonio Borneo
