<PRE>Do I actually need a new config file for the Logic 35x development board?

The CPU is the same OMAP3530. The JTAG header has 1.8V supply. 
The only difference is the fact this board uses a 20 pin ARM JTAG connector 
instead of the Ti-14 JTAG connector. As far as I see,  this different header 
only provides an nSRST line.

At the moment my biggest worry is that I do not understand what sets up the 
Flyswatter JTAG adapter to use 1.8V. Improper use here can damage the Logic 35x 
development board.
I hope you guys know something about it since you have support for the 
Flyswatter hardware JTAG dongle in openocd.

If Flyswatter uses the voltage provided on the ARM-20-pin header via pins 1/2 
(TVD/VDD) then it's ok. It means my board is dictating the supply. 

If Flyswatter needs a software configuration on init from openocd, I am not able 
to find it myself in the scripts.

Any help would be appreciated,
Gabi Voiculescu

unsupported board - Logic 35x Development Kit (aka LogicPD OMAP3530 SOM LV)

Hi.

Our board  has just bricked after an ESD. It no longer seems to boot up: does 
not autoload from the SD card, nor show characters in the debug console, nor 
turn on the LCD, not blink the GPIO leds like before.

It is an Logic 35x Development Kit (aka LogicPD OMAP3530 SOM LV): 
<A HREF="http://www.logicpd.com/products/development-kits/texas-instruments-zoom%E2%84%A2-omap35x-development-kit.">http://www.logicpd.com/products/development-kits/texas-instruments-zoom%E2%84%A2-omap35x-development-kit.</A>



I have measured most of  power supplies and concluded they are fine and the 
problem is most likely that the bootloader is corrupted in NAND.

I have a Flyswatter JTAG dongle and have created a ribbon adapter cable based 
on the schematics found here: 
<A HREF="http://www.tincantools.com/assets/ARM%2020-Pin%20JTAG%20Adapter.pdf.">http://www.tincantools.com/assets/ARM%2020-Pin%20JTAG%20Adapter.pdf.</A>

So hardware wise I'm sort of ready to reflash the NAND using JTAG.

I am looking into using openocd for the job but the first problem is there is no 

board cfg file for the  Logic 35x Development Kit (aka LogicPD OMAP3530 SOM LV) 
board. 


I do not want to damage the Logic board in the process.

Does anyone have a tested cfg file for this board?

If not, I would appreciate some support in creating a new file with these 
characteristics:

- the som module uses an OMAP3530 cpu
   * I imagine it calls source [find target/omap3530.cfg] in one of the lines
- the JTAG connector on the board is an ARM standard 20 header connector (same 
as in the pdf indicated above)
   * does this mean i need this line?
        reset_config trst_and_srst separate
- JTAG uses 1.8V (same as the beagleboard JTAG)
- the RTCK line is unconnected into the fliswater connector
  * does it mwan I need to default some cliock to 6MHz like in the 
ti_beagelboard.cfg?
       # Fall back to 6MHz if RTCK is not supported
       jtag_rclk 6000
- if it helps I need to flash the NAND and the default boot is according to the 
SOM LV schematics the SYS_BOOT[6:0] set by the default pinout:
       Default SYS_BOOT[6:0] =1101111NAND, USB, UART, MMC1



Thank you,
Gabi Voiculescu
