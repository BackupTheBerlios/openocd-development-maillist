Sorry, can't do that... The patch you see was created in Windows with 
TortoiseGIT, and there you cannot change method of patch creation. In 
Linux using git from command line makes me crazy in less then 5 
minutes... I really can't do anything with it, SVN is like 10^10 times 
simpler to use, and the names of commands do mean something, while in 
git they are very amusing and completely meaningless for me...

Believe me - I've tried. I've read a dozen of git guides lately and 
while I'd like to do something as simple as rename 3 files and commit 
it, I just can't. First I've fought for a while to reset my repository 
to a &quot;clean&quot; state (it's easier to just delete it and download 
again...), then I've tried renaming those files, but no luck there - git 
wants to commit a new directory jimtcl and there is no way to change its 
mind, and files with new names just cannot be commited...

Sorry, maybe someone else can try to do this right.

4\/3!!
