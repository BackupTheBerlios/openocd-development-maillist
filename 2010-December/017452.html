Are you blaming me for not having changed all the other lpc2xxx.cfg 
files yet? I promise I *will* change them all. They *must* be changed. 
See below.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> target file... What for? What does that make easier? If one has it's

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> more user-friendly, not user-hostile!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's the whole point of OpenOCD's layered config file approach.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Do you refuse to work with an LPC2138 device just because its target

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've stated on multiple occasions that for me this whole policy is wrong.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for the second paragraph, you are wrong. All LPC2xxx target config

</I>&gt;<i> some parameters in board config files and - somehow - people manage to

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>For me this policy is right. I'm willing to state this on as many 
occasions as required.

Look at the ever so perfect standalone configs:

lpc2148.cfg: The clock frequency is hard-coded as 14.756 MHz.
Nobody will ever use this device with a 14.756 MHz crystal. Nobody. Never.
Now assuming a realistic crystal of 12 MHz, the gentle user will use the 
device outside spec. With a 24 MHz crystal he might still be able to 
program the flash and verify correctly. Unfortunately he will have field 
returns, because the devices will certainly start failing after six 
months or so.
This has already happened.

lpc2103.cfg: The clock frequency is hard-coded as 12 MHz.
So you're saying is that anybody using crystals of 10, 14.756, 16, 
18.432, 20, 24 MHz has to accept that flashing won't work for him?
Just because you don't mind failures here and then?

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The problem is that &quot;right now&quot; OpenOCD provides all I need, because
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> there is no &quot;lpc2478_std&quot; config file, lpc2478.cfg works just fine - I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (and anyone willing to use OpenOCD with that chip) would have to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> create it first. Same amount of typing and user experience? I doubt it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - right now I don't need to know ANYTHING about tcl, OpenOCD's config
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> files etc. They work out-of-the-box. People working with more complex
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> boards are not forbidden to set right clock speed now. Actually I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> think they managed, because I've not seen any complaints...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Why can't you do with LPC2478 what you *must* do with LPC2148? I'm not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> getting it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We're talking about a three-liner: 1. your interface, 2. your clock
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> frequency, 3. your target.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's clearly a no-brainer!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't have to do that with ANY LPC2xxx file now. You're wrong here, 
</I>&gt;<i> because all these target files have frequency embedded inside without 
</I>&gt;<i> any parameters.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>You don't do it now? Then you're failing *miserably*.
Having embedded frequencies in the target files is plain wrong. It 
*DOESN'T* work.
