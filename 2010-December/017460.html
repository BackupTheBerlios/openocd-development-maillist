You may work for NXP, but you are wrong on this one. OpenOCD can halt 
the core before any instructions are executed. You may not believe me, 
but I've checked that.

I've created a code that changes the value of Timer0 TC register in the 
second instruction (the first one is loading the address of this register):

	ldr r0, =0xe0004008
	str r0, [r0]

After this instruction this register should have a value equal to its 
address. Value after reset is 0. Remember that this is the very first 
code that will be executed! There is no vector table, these two 
instructions are placed at address 0 in flash. Value of this register is 
not used anywhere else, the timer itself also isn't.

As you see having &quot;reset_config separate&quot; allows you to halt the chip 
immediatelly after reset - the value of Timer0 TC after &quot;reset halt&quot; is 
0. That's why having default value (when having reset_config separate) 
actually is possible for the parts that have internal oscillator.

The core is halted even before executing the code of internal LPC 
bootloader... I can see the first instructions of it, changing MEMMAP 
makes it possible to see the code I'm talking about above.

I wonder whether writing to flash can be made in a smarter way bypassing 
this whole IAP. There's just 8kB of thumb code to be disassembled, 
probably most of it regarding UART communication that's not interesting 
in OpenOCD's case.

I once also believed that in LPCs you cannot &quot;reset halt&quot; reliably. I 
didn't check that - I just believed because everyone told that and I 
told the same to everyone else. And yet it's not true...

So - once again - are you sure that when &quot;reset_config&quot; is &quot;separate&quot; 
the core after reset will not be running at 4MHz? Because I know it will 
and nothing can change that.

&gt;&gt;<i> You say there is none, I say there is. There's no way we can agree.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you follow the arguments above about clock frequency uncertainty,
</I>&gt;<i> then with all due respect you cannot but agree :-)
</I>
If you follow the arguments above about clock frequency certainty then 
with all due respect you cannot but agree that there is a default frequency.

As you don't wish to participate in this discussion then I will not 
reply to the rest of your post.

4\/3!!
