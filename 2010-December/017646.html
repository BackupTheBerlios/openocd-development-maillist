<PRE>Hi together,

I made some config scripts for the Hilscher netX chips and several
evaluation boards. I am currently preparing to get them added and now I
have some questions how they should look like, as I am currently having
a large script for each board / JTAG combination, containing all options
and I want to break it up into target/board/interface.

As far as I understand the interface scripts are for the different JTAG
connections. Most of the Hilscher boards have an FTDI chip on board but
the identification is always board dependent. They all have a common
VID/PID but a different device descriptor.

Example:
Hilscher NXHX500 Board has VID=0x0640 , PID=0x0028, Descr=&quot;NXHX500-RE A&quot;
Hilscher NXHX50 Board has VID=0x0640 , PID=0x0028 , Descr=&quot;NXHX50-RE A&quot;
As there are several variants of the board it will be quite a large
amount of scripts, so I would prefer a single script getting the
descriptor passed (or can I leave out the descriptor)?

Will I need to provide an individual file for each interface or is there
some possibility to make this common (e.g. passing the Descriptor via
command line, or something else)?

Another thing is. Currently I have one script for attaching to CPU
(ommitting the &quot;reset init&quot; command) and one for completely initializing
the board. Is this something I can control from the command line too or
how would someone attach to the CPU without reset?

Last thing. If I am done with reworking the scripts should I post a git
pull request or are you prefering patches on the mailing list?

Regards,
Michael
