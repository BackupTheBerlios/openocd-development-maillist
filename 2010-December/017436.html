<PRE>Hi Freddie,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>This is a misconception. When OpenOCD tries to take control after a

may or may not have changed the clock tree. Like it or not, but there is 
no a priori knowledge of CPU clock.

With LPC23xx you are in the same situation as with older LPC2000 which 
required an external crystal. The operating frequency is *not* a target 
parameter, it is a board/application parameter.

&gt;&gt;<i> What's the purpose of using a 512KiB flash micro if you only need 50K?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Lots of applications *will* use big parts of the flash, and yes,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are talking 10s vs. 20s (and for no good reason!).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why use big chip? LPC2478 has an LCD driver, and there is no chip with

</I>&gt;<i> we should be talking about the average size of the upload, and that's 
</I>&gt;<i> never 512kB - the code has to grow from 0 to this size during 
</I>&gt;<i> developement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW - you use libusb of ftd2xx (if you use Windows and FT2232 based 
</I>&gt;<i> JTAG)? I'm asking because if waiting 10s is worth breaking 
</I>&gt;<i> configurations of OpenOCD's regular users, then I hope you use the 
</I>&gt;<i> fastest library for the process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> C'mon! 10s?! Don't read mailing lists and that will save you much more 
</I>&gt;<i> time (;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I'm afraid but professional embedded development is different. Speed 
matters.
Why would I renounce the comfort of a fast download when I can get it 
for free?
I want OpenOCD to be as efficient as possible.

If you don't like that, you may always run at a slower clock, and help 
yourself with a cup of tea.


&gt;<i> But there's no point in having a &quot;board&quot; file that in reality is not 
</I>&gt;<i> for board but for target, that will do nothing more than include 
</I>&gt;<i> target file... What for? What does that make easier? If one has it's 
</I>&gt;<i> own board with some chip I don't think one would look for config 
</I>&gt;<i> scripts in board directory... I wouldn't. Please - try to make OpenOCD 
</I>&gt;<i> more user-friendly, not user-hostile!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>That's the whole point of OpenOCD's layered config file approach.

Do you refuse to work with an LPC2138 device just because its target 
config file cannot include a clock frequency? There is no way to avoid a 
board file here. And at the risk of repeating myself, the situation for 
LPC23xx is the same.


&gt;&gt;<i> So what is the problem? Right now, you are using the LPC2478 target
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> config file. You could use some kind of &quot;lpc2478_std&quot; config file
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instead - same amount of typing, same user experience, but those people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> working with more complex boards will have the benefit of running at the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> right clock speed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is that &quot;right now&quot; OpenOCD provides all I need, because 
</I>&gt;<i> there is no &quot;lpc2478_std&quot; config file, lpc2478.cfg works just fine - I 
</I>&gt;<i> (and anyone willing to use OpenOCD with that chip) would have to 
</I>&gt;<i> create it first. Same amount of typing and user experience? I doubt it 
</I>&gt;<i> - right now I don't need to know ANYTHING about tcl, OpenOCD's config 
</I>&gt;<i> files etc. They work out-of-the-box. People working with more complex 
</I>&gt;<i> boards are not forbidden to set right clock speed now. Actually I 
</I>&gt;<i> think they managed, because I've not seen any complaints...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Why can't you do with LPC2478 what you *must* do with LPC2148? I'm not 
getting it.
We're talking about a three-liner: 1. your interface, 2. your clock 
frequency, 3. your target.
That's clearly a no-brainer!

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I have a crazy idea - I think it is possible to measure frequency of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the external crystal (and check for it's existence) with simple code
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> using one timer. This way OpenOCD would work without specifying this
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> frequency. It could then - before programming - measure it (backup-ing
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> all settings of timer), switch PLL to max value (using external
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> crystal or internal resonator, also backup-ing all settings of clock
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and PLL), flash, revert all changes made to clock, PLL and timer and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> voila [; Problem gone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Nice idea. However, that goes way beyond what is required right now to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> get reliable programming at the maximum possible speed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, will this work without a &quot;reset init&quot; to get the system into a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> known state?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was thinking about embedding that within OpenOCD's flash handling 
</I>&gt;<i> code specific for LPC, not in config files. Right now you have to 
</I>&gt;<i> supply that speed, with such wise flashing algorithm this parameter 
</I>&gt;<i> would be useless (could be provided, could be omitted - freq would be 
</I>&gt;<i> measured then).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Deep inside I have a feeling that this proposal is on a head-on 
collision course with your wish for simplicity...

Technically, I do not know how you want to measure frequency without a 
timing reference.
And why on earth would I *temporarily* enable the PLL to circumvent the 
difficulty of enabling the PLL at all?
I'm lost.

Rolf
