<PRE>Hi,

Thanks.

I have had significant development issues both with LPC2148 and
LPC1768 having reset_config srst_pulls_trst in their target files.

It was impossible to control either microcontroller with
srst_pulls_trst set.

In case of 2148 it was a matter of my code generating an exception
before OpenOCD could take control. Since the pins were independent
on chip and JTAG connector I tried removing srst_pulls_trst and that
immediately allowed me to reliably control the CPU.

I was quite annoyed at whomever had set this option. It took me a
while to discover the first time. Especially as it was my first
project using OpenOCD.

I only patched these two target configs as I encountered the issue on
each of them, specifically because I thought that maybe this was
something that had been true for earlier LPC2000 and had been
extrapolated to all of the configs. Since Freddie needs it also for
2103 I guess it's plain wrong, and only some really badly designed
boards need it. (Agree, we need that capability infrastructure.)


&gt;<i> You say this option is required, I say it's not, the experiments
</I>&gt;<i> show reliable debugging etc. so where's the problem?
</I>
I will violently oppose any attempt to add the option back to config
files for 2148 and 1768. Expect all sorts of bits and bytes thrown at
you. It has wasted enough of my life time already thank you very much.


//Peter
