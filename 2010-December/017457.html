Funny thing, each time I recall a discussion about LPC2xxx scripts, the 
discussion always quickly drifts to state where there isn't even a 
simplest attempt to try to make any good out of it. Most of time, there 
are good points in both (or several, even) camps but I'm sorry to say, 
that you who seem to do the most development are making the decisions as 
*you* think what the users want. That said, I don't feel much like 
contributing to any of this but just trying to make it all to work for 
me and all the companies I work for.

Personally I don't like using NPX's ARM7 devices due to the stupid 
hardware where the user software on the flash is executed &#8211; only gods 
know how many lines - before JTAG gets grip on the device. One can deal 
with it, but not elegantly out-of-box, which I think should be the 
target for all the OpenOCD development. Ok, I admit that of course not 
everything can be universal &#8211; and should not be as it is just pure 
impossibility &#8211; but good examples for necessary steps to get everything 
running is good way to go.

For what it's worth, I think the interface and target scripts should be 
as general as possible. Need of board file shouldn't be a bad thing? 
This is a great place to put everything product specific configurations, 
e.g. crystal speed. This *can* vary and thus not changing the target 
script itself makes it useful for *all* boards being used.

About the programming speed: I've heard a lot of complaints about this. 
It's not about the time wasted in minutes per day. It's just purely 
about convenience of use. The developer needs to try out something &#8211; 
sometimes by trial and error &#8211; and more you have to wait the more you 
hate it. It's like using a poor text editor. If the response between key 
press and display is slow, it's pain in ass to use although it surely 
isn't obstacle for getting the work done.

I don't know, this seems to be one of those very touchy topics so most 
likely I'm not coming back to this anymore, but hope this gives a new 
view to the discussion, and hopefully you can find a consensus of some kind.

With best regards,
Petri
