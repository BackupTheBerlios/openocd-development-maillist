Looking at this further, there are only two places that 
jtag_register_event_callback() is called from, the first from 
jtag_tap_init() with the a new TAP instance as the priv parameter, and 
the second from target_examine() with a target as the priv parameter.

The first case I believe can only be called once per unique priv 
instance by virtue of the fact that it's part of the TAP initialisation 
and the TAP instance is the priv parameter.  The second case only 
appears to be called from the init handler which is guarded by a static 
initialized flag.

However, there is nothing to help prevent issues being introduced with 
their future usage.  At the very least the functions should have banner 
describing the interface contract, specifically whether multiple 
registration are disallowed, allowed with balanced de-registration, or 
allowed with only a single de-registration necessary.  I think the 
former with safety checks would be the safest, however this would 
increase the footprint of change if we were to require consistency.

For now I suggest we can stay consistent with the target based list 
function implementations?  This would appear to imply that multiple 
registrations are possible but registration / de-registration balance is 
the responsibility of the client.

I also think the benefits of a common list function here are outweighed 
by the simplicity of the function (the bug and the generated discussion 
excepted!) and lost readability in the specialisation casts.

I'd be happy to test and submit a new patch candidate if and when we're 
all in agreement.

Peter, note that the double pointers are in the target list function 
implementations (that would be copied), are you ok with this?  I think 
the implementations are concise and readable, though maybe my 
sensitivity to double pointers has dulled...

Cheers,

Paul
