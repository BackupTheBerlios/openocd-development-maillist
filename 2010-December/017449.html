</I>
So you're all about correctness and you don't reset halt the chip before 
flashing? How is that correct? Actually flashing does not work if you 
don't &quot;reset halt&quot; the chip. The need for halting is obvious. The need 
for reset is not, but think about what would happen if your code would 
have a timer (or any) interrupt enabled and running during your 
flashing. Actually you DO need to get the chip in some known (and 
specific!) condition to flash it. Moreover - the new config file works 
exactly the same way - you can specify the clock as a parameter, but to 
be sure about it you need to reset halt or reset init.

&gt;&gt;<i> Why use big chip? LPC2478 has an LCD driver, and there is no chip with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> LCD driver that has less flash. Because for developement of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> project you take big chip just-in-case, and choose right one

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> BTW - you use libusb of ftd2xx (if you use Windows and FT2232 based
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> JTAG)? I'm asking because if waiting 10s is worth breaking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> configurations of OpenOCD's regular users, then I hope you use the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> C'mon! 10s?! Don't read mailing lists and that will save you much more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time (;
</I>&gt;<i> It's not about the total amount of time, it is about interrupting my
</I>&gt;<i> work on every upload.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now how is the operating system I use relevant for this discussion? Just
</I>&gt;<i> because some things in OpenOCD might be improved does not mean that we
</I>&gt;<i> should slow down other operations as well - for no benefit, just because
</I>&gt;<i> you declare that it should be &quot;good enough&quot; for everyone.
</I>
Operating system matters because ftd2xx is faster only on Windows - in 
Linux it's slower or the same.

I'm not telling &quot;slow down&quot; - I'm saying &quot;don't use this file that can 
speed things up because it also makes using OpenOCD a bit harder&quot;. 
Technically this file does not speed anything up, because there is no 
PLL setting anywhere in it - the new board config file (another patch) 
does speed things up and it can speed things up exactly the same way now 
or when lpc2478.cfg would use some default value.

BTW why isn't the pll configuration function placed in target file?

&gt;<i> Then let's provide a board config file that works fine on those barebone
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> applications where OpenOCD does not need to know anything beyond the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> CPU.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But there's no point in having a &quot;board&quot; file that in reality is not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for board but for target, that will do nothing more than include
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> target file... What for? What does that make easier? If one has it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> own board with some chip I don't think one would look for config
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scripts in board directory... I wouldn't. Please - try to make OpenOCD
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more user-friendly, not user-hostile!
</I>&gt;<i> The config file you need *is* for a board, so it belongs in the board
</I>&gt;<i> directory. The LPC target alone can not know the clock used.
</I>
If I'd have the microcontroller hooked up directly to JTAG and PSU with 
thin cables would that be considered a board too? It's just a simple 
microcontroller! It needs almost none configuration on OpenOCD's side - 
every board with LPC2478 was using the old file and it was fine.

&gt;&gt;<i> The problem is that &quot;right now&quot; OpenOCD provides all I need, because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there is no &quot;lpc2478_std&quot; config file, lpc2478.cfg works just fine - I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (and anyone willing to use OpenOCD with that chip) would have to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> create it first. Same amount of typing and user experience? I doubt it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - right now I don't need to know ANYTHING about tcl, OpenOCD's config
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> files etc. They work out-of-the-box. People working with more complex
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> boards are not forbidden to set right clock speed now. Actually I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think they managed, because I've not seen any complaints...
</I>&gt;<i> Um - no. I proposed to add that file to OpenOCD, so no user would need
</I>&gt;<i> to learn TCL or write his own config file - just like it is now.
</I>
You said &quot;use some file&quot;, not &quot;I'll add that to OpenOCD&quot;...

&gt;&gt;<i> I've made a proposal to create target files for every chip that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenOCD could support and organize them neatly in directories. This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has a disadvantage of having hundreds of files. Your approach (having
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> board file just because target file was made dependent on some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parameters) creates a need for otherwise useless files...
</I>&gt;<i> It is not useless - it enables other board config files to specify the
</I>&gt;<i> real clock speed.
</I>
Again - it would be even more useful if it had default frequency with a 
warning.

4\/3!!
