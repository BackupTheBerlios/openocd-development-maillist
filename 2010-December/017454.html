So you say that after reset and immediate halt the chip clock (for new 
LPCs) is not 4MHz? Are you working for NXP and do you know something 
that's not public? Because the manuals say something different than you. 
Bootloader has nothing to do with it, as &quot;reset halt&quot; will prevent it 
from running and changing anything.

&gt;&gt;<i> Indeed - older LPCs don't work this way, because there is no internal

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> value, and leave all older files that CAN'T?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, the lpc2478.cfg *CANNOT* work with a default, because there is none.
</I>
You say there is none, I say there is. There's no way we can agree.

&gt;<i> Are you blaming me for not having changed all the other lpc2xxx.cfg
</I>&gt;<i> files yet? I promise I *will* change them all. They *must* be changed.
</I>&gt;<i> See below.
</I>
Sure - OpenOCD can be changed so that other - easier to use - tools 
would be more and more popular.

&gt;<i> For me this policy is right. I'm willing to state this on as many
</I>&gt;<i> occasions as required.
</I>
I can also say it's wrong anytime, so obviously we cannot agree on that 
subject too.

&gt;<i> Look at the ever so perfect standalone configs:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> lpc2148.cfg: The clock frequency is hard-coded as 14.756 MHz.
</I>&gt;<i> Nobody will ever use this device with a 14.756 MHz crystal. Nobody. Never.
</I>&gt;<i> Now assuming a realistic crystal of 12 MHz, the gentle user will use the
</I>&gt;<i> device outside spec. With a 24 MHz crystal he might still be able to

</I>&gt;<i> months or so.
</I>&gt;<i> This has already happened.
</I>
Changing these 5 numbers is pretty straightforward and people do that 
(as OpenOCD works for them). I do. And are you saying that programming 
flash with wrong speed causes it to fail LATER? Again - do you have some 
secret knowledge from NXP that general public doesn't?

&gt;<i> lpc2103.cfg: The clock frequency is hard-coded as 12 MHz.
</I>&gt;<i> So you're saying is that anybody using crystals of 10, 14.756, 16,
</I>&gt;<i> 18.432, 20, 24 MHz has to accept that flashing won't work for him?
</I>&gt;<i> Just because you don't mind failures here and then?
</I>
Obviously this device cannot be used with 14.765 crystal because LPC2148 
also cannot (see your paragraph above) - I don't know why is that, but 
if you say so...

&gt;&gt;<i> I don't have to do that with ANY LPC2xxx file now. You're wrong here,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because all these target files have frequency embedded inside without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any parameters.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You don't do it now? Then you're failing *miserably*.
</I>&gt;<i> Having embedded frequencies in the target files is plain wrong. It
</I>&gt;<i> *DOESN'T* work.
</I>
It works because I set the right frequency in files. This is pretty 
simple because I usually see no reason to use crystals different than 
12MHz. Yes, this must be plain wrong, and you must be plain right, as 
the world is black and white. Ease of use does not matter, the most 
important thing is to be ultra-correct with everything. Do you actually 
care about the users, or maybe you're affiliated with Keil or IAR and 
your goal is to make using OpenOCD harder? Really - your change does 
nothing more than make OpenOCD harder to use, as everyone could change 
that frequency before that (and they did, as people were using OpenOCD 
successfully with those chips for a long time), but to do that no 
additional file was required.

Again (and again) - default (whatever they may or may not be) values 
with warning for ALL LPC config files are GOOD. Adding &quot;board&quot; files 
with such default value is exactly the same as leaving default value 
inside target files. You loose nothing, we gain easy use and we are 
warned that this may fail in some way or another.

Alternatively you may want to make that work:
openocd -c &quot;set FREQ 12345&quot; -f interface/... -f target/...
Because now it does not work (at least it didn't work the last time I've 
tried). It would also be fine. The need for obligatory creation of 
otherwise useless files is not fine.

4\/3!!
