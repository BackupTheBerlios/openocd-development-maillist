<PRE>&#216;yvind Harboe a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> We use the Zylin Embedded CDT on linux daily inhouse and I've received
</I>&gt;<i> lots of feedback indicating that there are Linux users out there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It does work on Cygwin too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On cdt-contrib.sourceforge.net you need to check out embeddedcdt4. The
</I>&gt;<i> older embeddedcdt versions are still there only for reference. Perhaps it
</I>&gt;<i> would be better to delete them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is the latest version:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://opensource.zylin.com/embeddedcdt.html">http://opensource.zylin.com/embeddedcdt.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
On Mandriva 2009.1 the latest version still has 11 warnings and no 
errors, a good improvement.
Some warnings seem to be irrelevant and some give some doubt on whether 
it will run correctly or not.

example

- Acc&#232;s d&#233;conseill&#233; : The method getInstance() from the type
     WorkbenchHelpSystem is not accessible due to restriction on required
     library /usr/lib/eclipse/plugins/
     org.eclipse.ui.workbench_3.4.2.M20090127-1700.jar

There were some issues on Fedora 9. The previous version I tried would 
barf on Ubuntu 8.10 until I installed the newer eclipse.

This one is better than the 4.5 version even though it still has the 
requirement for two phantom directories
It can be fixed by removing those items. The name of the directories in 
question seem to give the impression that the plugin
will be cripple in some instances unless those are put it there.
What are those ThirdParty parts?

One thing I don't understand about that eclipse compiling is that I 
would consider a missing directory an error and not a warning.

&gt;&gt;<i> When you get to the zylin website it is obvious that only windows is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> supported.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For my information: where does it say that only windows is supported?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It certainly was not my intention to give that impression.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>You haven't provided a working Linux binary since version 3.2
I prefer to compile my own but many people do not.
I think that the best approach on your site would be to ask people to 
provide packages for different distributions if you are not willing or 
don't have
the time to do it. On the setedit and turbo vision projects we have done 
that and it has been very well received.
Not too many people are interested in blindly copying plugins in the 
eclipse plugin directory and prefer to rely on people who know what 
they're doing.

If you are interested I could provide some packages for
1-Fedora 9 32 bits
2-Ubuntu 8.10 32 bits
3-Ubuntu 9.04 32 bits
4-SuSE 11.1 64 bits
5-SuSE 11.0 32 bits
6-Mandriva 2009.1 32 bits
