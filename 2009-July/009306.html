We might not release until X-mas.

There needs to be testing of all changes in trunk.  That takes a week
without significant changes, at our current level of activity.

</I>&gt;<i> Cutting a release is *cheap* right?
</I>
Yes, but there is some cost in having N versions in the field.  Sure, we
could release after each commit, and we would see few bug reports for
any given release.  Users have no idea which one is good.  This be bad.

In contrast, we have been working towards the 0.2.0 release for months.
We need a release off which users can perform testing and spot
regressions from 0.1.0 (or earlier).  Right now, we still require bug
reports from SVN, and that will end with 0.2.0 (and sooner is better).
Once we fix &quot;enough&quot; bugs we can consider releasing 0.3.0, which will
include some additional development.

We need to find some balance.  Right now, the presses are too heavily
biased toward &quot;development&quot; to the extent that &quot;release&quot; suffers badly.

Cheers,

Zach
