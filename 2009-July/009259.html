This does not meet my standard for &quot;explaining&quot; the changes that went
into the OpenOCD tree, in so far as I still need additional confidence
that your changes were correct.  The above only clarifies that they were
well intentioned.

Your commit messages and posts need significantly more details.  I am
not expressing this sentiment for my own sake.  Your lack of explanation
translates directly in to development opacity for the users, as your
commit messages will appear in the published ChangeLog files.  

Brevity is not user-friendly in these areas.  It is not even good to
assume that other developers will grok your changes, or that your
changes will be correct on all host platforms or targets.

&gt;<i> One concern that I have with 0.2 is that it contains a lot
</I>&gt;<i> of *great* refactoring work, but this is unobservable to
</I>&gt;<i> the casual user.
</I>
This is one price of progress, but releases will help with this.

&gt;<i> It will take a *long* time get testing done for all types
</I>&gt;<i> of targets. Testing really has to be done on svn head anyway...
</I>
*sigh*   These comments have caused me to write up testing processes
that are not entirely unlike the release processes in the scope.  I am
providing the same sort of analysis (why, who, what, how, when), in
order to set down some understanding about what &quot;testing&quot; should mean.  

In the face of those broader definitions, I disagree with your claims.
Your definition of that word seems far too narrow, but we can settle
this debate in a separate when I post that new file. :)

&gt;<i> &gt;From this point of view 0.1 is much better because there
</I>&gt;<i> was a lot less development going on prior to 0.1 release...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What about cutting a 0.2 branch now(going back a few svn
</I>&gt;<i> versions if necessary) and leaving arm926ejs for 0.3?
</I>
No.  That creates more work for the release manager (me), because there
are other fixes that have gone in on top of your changes.  I will not be
doing extra make-work like this in an unpaid capacity, and I would
rather see others spend their time improving the trunk and producing
more releases.

Until your recent patches, the trunk was ready to be branched and tagged
without such extra labor, and I am somewhat unhappy that the release
needs to been postponed for more testing.  I am more disappointed that
you avoided explaining the patches directly, which takes more individual
responsibility for the situation than your present suggestions and
continued actions seem to demonstrate to me personally.  Rather, than
waiting for clarification from the Release Manager, you plunged ahead.

It's great that you found these bugs and want to fix them, but your
patches should not be committed without sufficient explanation and
community review.  You have been committing directly during the
preparations for the 0.2.0 release, which I see as a serious failure in
our process.  However, this characterization as &quot;failure&quot; reflects my
hope for the future, rather than expectations from my experiences here.
Since things have been more flexible in the past, these events should
more fairly be called a &quot;learning experience&quot; for all involved. ;)

So, we need to move forward.  After we are done with testing, I think we
should release 0.2.0 and plan to release 0.3.0 in the middle of August.
This will allow for a few weeks of development and a week of testing,
more or less.  That may seem like a fast cycle, but it seems like a good
compromise in the face of skipping bug-fix releases for 0.2.0.

I would see us schedule 0.4.0 in the same fashion, but I may want to
change things for 0.5.0 or beyond.  Two or three more releases should
allow enough time for many major clean-ups and improvements that have
planned to be implemented (e.g. libopenocd, modules, etc.).  

After 0.5.0, the pace of change may slow unless more innovation makes
its way onto the list.  Hopefully, we will be coping with a large influx
of developers writing support for new targets, and we will have the
resources to be producing both -rc and bug-fix releases.

&gt;<i> Perhaps we can backport a few things from svn head?
</I>
Again, I do not think we should spend any of our time doing release
branch maintenance at this point.  There is too much work remaining in
the code for the project's resources to be diluted in that way, when we
should simply be releasing more often and getting more testing feedback.

I think we need more active contributors and users to be able to sustain
release branches.  Until then, the community should focus on each
release in unison.  We should all stop development and work to test the
pending release, post patches to fix bugs, review those fixes, and apply
only changes that work everywhere for everyone -- without regressions or
other new bugs to clean up (functional, stylistic, or otherwise).

Right now, we are seeing that this process needs work in the trunk, as
these steps are not being used in critical cases.  The idea of trying to
manage multiple branches in these conditions frightens and confuses me.

Cheers,

Zach
