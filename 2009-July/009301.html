This seems like a slippery slope to me.  One week could easily turn into
two, then another week after that, and so on.  We said that we would
release on 7/1, and we are now a week late.  Another week makes us two
weeks late.

Speaking as release manager, I find this unacceptable from the
perspective of users' expectations.  We have talked about that deadline
for a while, and we need to stick by it unless these problems are truly
insurmountable.  I believe there are workarounds for all bugs being
discussed, so -- while it would be great to have fixes -- they do not
seem like reasons to block the release for much longer.

Tell me about it.  I am happy to see it happening, but seeing patches
rejected should cause things to be different for the next release.

&gt;<i> During that week ... should there be a policy on commits,

</I>
Right.  I am happy with direct trunk commits during the normal
development process -- just not during the release process.
Explicit ACK/NACK is probably the best policy, particularly if everyone
know that such will be required for progress.

Cheers,

Zach
