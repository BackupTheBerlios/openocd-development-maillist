<PRE>Zach,

I agree with you in principal that in an ideal situation finding the
problems and fixing the behavior there rather then in openocd would the best
practice.

I think it is also safe to say that the primary testers Xiaofan, Spencer,
you, and me are all using the latest library versions.  So that is safe to
rule out as a possibility for causing problems.

Likewise I have reviewed the USB manual over and over as others have looking
for the missing magic link.  But based on the observations that Xiaofan and
others have made about the sorry state of libusb's current development
state, I personally don't think there is one to be found.

With all those things said, at this point as ugly as conditionals are, I
would rather have openocd work for as many platforms as possible to attract
user interest and capture mindshare.  The alternative is to have no
conditionals and have users frustrated and leave when openocd is found to be
buggy on their particular platform.

Given the fact that fixing libusb is looking more like an improbability, I
took Spencer's latest patch and made two minor modifications (comments +
moved second open_usb up one notch so that it was excluded for Mac OS X
builds).  I don't believe they will have any bearing on Windows or Linux
since the code emitted should be the same for those platforms.  I am hoping
that both Spencer and Xiaofan will give the modification a lookover to
confirm that.

If they give a thumbs up, would you agree that committing the patch makes
the most sense at this point given what we know today about libusb?
