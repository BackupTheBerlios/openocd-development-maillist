<PRE>Hi all,

I have been thinking about adding some supplemental &quot;source&quot; packages,
which can be used by OpenOCD distributors as they see fit:
- openocd-user-guide: both PDF and HTML versions (or separated?)
- openocd-developer-manual: both PDF and HTML versions (ditto?)

Some of these things require more work to produce or package, but I have
a patch that improves the doxygen output to produce an (enormous) PDF
version of the Developer Manual.  This makes the main page and
introductory text pages that I have put in place _much_ more readable,
as they are presented in a linear format.

Since these changes impact the build time for the documentation, I
decided to forgo further work in this area until after 0.2.0, when I can
add some configure options to manage what gets built.  Today, these
artifacts could distributable by creating suitable archives by hand, but
I would be happier to see these come later (through automation) to avoid
delays with the current release.

I think that packaging all of this documentation would be preferable to
forcing every developer or distribution to produce them, as it allows
both easy packaging and distribution as well as uniform presentation of
the information (e.g. get graphs without having to install graphviz).

Thoughts?  I am curious what packagers think of this idea too.

Cheers,

Zach
