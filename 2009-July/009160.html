<PRE>Hi all,

With my latest series of commits, I believe that the release process is
finally ready to see action.  That said, we have seen a bit of
bug-fixing activity during the time that I have been preparing, and
several new patches have hit the repository.  The countdown is on hold.

The new changes for arm7_9_common.c and arm926ejc.c need to be given
time to ensure they work on all targets being tested for the release.
Honestly, I am tempted to ask for them to reverted for the time being,
as I cannot trivially determine their correctness after casual review.
Of course, these were not given time for review in the first place;
given the pending release, this was a major faux pas and cannot escape
mention as such.  :/

Since it appears that they do not help the ARM926EJS problems that were
reported after the commits, perhaps reverting them may be the best path
If not, I want to understand why we should keep them for 0.2.0. Again,
such explanations should have been provided with the e-mail descriptions
or commit message.  I hate to &quot;make an example&quot; out of these changes,
but I want the community to handle these issues better in the future.

What do others think about these changes?  Are they safe to keep, or
should we revert them to make the release?  If we keep them without
confirmation, I want to wait until the community provides feedback
confirming that nothing has broken.  In this respect, I think the
release process deserves to be put on hold, until the changes are
reverted or have been explained fully and confirmed to be correct.
Personally, I would prefer to hear confirmation that they are good.

Other than those changes, fixes for MinGW32 cross-compiling are pending
to be committed, but I cannot think of any other issues that have a
solution waiting to be tested.  Maintainers: please commit ONLY patches
that have been reviewed by the mailing list for at least 12 hours.
These should be confirmed by others that the changes fix problems (or
have benefit) for the community.

If feedback to this thread indicates that we are ready, I will produce
the 0.2.0 release about 12 hours after the last patches are committed.
Each new patch that is committed will reset the release clock.  Does
this sound reasonable to everyone?

Cheers,

Zach
