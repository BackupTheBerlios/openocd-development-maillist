That's sure helping in the development process.  &quot;Here, see if this
patch fixes the problem for you.&quot;  Without that sort of feedback
loop, projects get nowhere.

Also, keep in mind that anyone using a JTAG tool in their work is
likely to be a developer already ... one fluent in low-level issues,
in fact.  There won't be many exceptions to that rule; and they'd be
the kind of folk that *this* team doesn't address, much less deal
with directly.  Using JTAG for pass/fail board testing on a factory
floor, maybe ... rather than the people who use results of such tests
to figure out if the board can just get a partia repair.


&gt;<i> It is _those_ individuals that should never be asked to build from the

</I>&gt;<i> produce one for them with their fix using 'make dist'. &#160;Right?
</I>
No.  If they're getting support from their distributor, we
aren't invoved anyway.  (They're more part of the vendor's
community than ours...)  I think anyone getting support from
the developers needs to be willing to test patches.  If
they weren't willing to apply experimental patches and then
rebuild, WTF would they expect to happen?
