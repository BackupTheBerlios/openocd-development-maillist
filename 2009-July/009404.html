Volunteers in most communities are expected to behave professionally, as
evidenced by medical or early educational volunteer positions.  If you
do not perform according to expectations, you do not get to retain the
privilege of even a volunteer position.  That may sound harsh, but it
derives from high standards.  In this way, we need these guidelines to
define the roles of key contributors, as performance standards can only
be enforced from the top down.

The reality about the harsh language is this: I hope it never needs to
be used.  However, you should read this as a social contract: governance
of the project is in the maintainers hands, and this document spells out
their responsibilities -- which allows users to hold us accountable.
Without such language, there will be only continued chaos, which has led
to valued contributors leaving the project and threats to fork the code.

If the rules seem too harsh, then you are not ready to be a maintainer.
This may itself sound harsh, but I hear the world is unfair too.  These
are drafts documents, however; I want to incorporate feedback like yours
until the community agrees that the guidelines seem fair.  The language
may need to be revised for any number of reasons; however, these kinds
of guidelines exist in any project that reaches a certain critical mass.

With these guidelines in place and agreed upon, the community should be
able resolve disputes regarding maintainer authority, responsibility,
and accountability in the project.  Personally, I have no problem being
held accountable for the responsibilities that I have been doing here,
so long as I had the required authority to complete the work.  

Speaking in the capacity of an unpaid volunteer, I will not continue to
volunteer my time on a project that has been filled with volatility,
most of which appear to be caused by power struggles over issues that
could have been resolved if proper management had been in place.  Wither
paid or not, these are signs of a poorly governed project.

These guidelines seek to put an end to such shenanigans, before the
constant turmoil drives all of the quality contributors to create a fork
where this chaos will never be allowed to blossom in the first place.

&gt;<i> As for the test document part, I feel this sentence is a bit strange.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Users should never be asked to test the SVN.&quot;. Maybe this sentence
</I>&gt;<i> itself is correct. But users will have to test the SVN after all since
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD has not reached 1.0 stage and many bug fixes will have to
</I>&gt;<i> be tested in SVN.
</I>
There is an important point to make to start: the labels &quot;user&quot; and
&quot;developer&quot; are disgustingly black-and-white for open source software.
Our reality tends to be full of gray; however, I think it is clearly a
bad policy to ask &quot;users&quot; -- those who are not developers -- to use the
&quot;developer&quot; SVN repository.

We should be producing releases frequently enough that &quot;users&quot; can wait
for the next release.  If you _can_ build the repository, then you are
not really a &quot;user&quot; in this scenario.  I do _not_ want &quot;users&quot; trying to
_build_ the SVN repository.  Asking the users to test the SVN is asking
them to do everything that a developer must do.  That is an unacceptable
process for users, as it will result in more false reports from failed
(re)building than it will help test the bug.

Instead, they should wait for a source archive release, which will not
require them to use the autotools bootstrap.  If we need &quot;users&quot; to test
more often than releases, we can produce nightly tarballs.  They should
_not_ use SVN.  Our processes have failed if we must ask them to do so.

In other words, the costs of &quot;users&quot; trying to use SVN will far outweigh
the benefits , when nightly tarballs would solve the problem.  Further,
most &quot;users&quot; will probably be running binaries provided by others, and
those individuals should be reporting bugs to their distributor -- not
the open source community.  Those individuals _can_ test SVN.

Cheers,

Zach
