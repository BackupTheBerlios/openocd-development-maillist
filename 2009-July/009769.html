<PRE>I'll answer a few more questions here, but really these belong
in the zylin-discuss mailing list.

[stuff deleted w.r.t. warnings, I'll have a peek at the current warnings
at some point]

&gt;<i> This one is better than the 4.5 version even though it still has the
</I>&gt;<i> requirement for two phantom directories
</I>&gt;<i> It can be fixed by removing those items.
</I>
What directories?

&gt;<i> The name of the directories in
</I>&gt;<i> question seem to give the impression that the plugin
</I>&gt;<i> will be cripple in some instances unless those are put it there.
</I>&gt;<i> What are those ThirdParty parts?
</I>
What are they called?

&gt;<i> One thing I don't understand about that eclipse compiling is that I would
</I>&gt;<i> consider a missing directory an error and not a warning.
</I>
Hmm... java doesn't &quot;compile directories&quot; or require empty ones... I don't
know what you are referring to here.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> When you get to the zylin website it is obvious that only windows is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> supported.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For my information: where does it say that only windows is supported?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It certainly was not my intention to give that impression.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You haven't provided a working Linux binary since version 3.2
</I>
What binary are you referring to?

The update site works fine on e.g. Eclipse 3.5 w/Ubuntu 9.04.

There update site works on all operating systems, no special
linux binary required.

&gt;<i> I prefer to compile my own but many people do not.
</I>&gt;<i> I think that the best approach on your site would be to ask people to
</I>&gt;<i> provide packages for different distributions if you are not willing or don't
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> the time to do it. On the setedit and turbo vision projects we have done
</I>&gt;<i> that and it has been very well received.
</I>&gt;<i> Not too many people are interested in blindly copying plugins in the eclipse
</I>&gt;<i> plugin directory and prefer to rely on people who know what they're doing.
</I>
The Zylin Embedded CDT is identical for all distributions of linux
or operating systems for that matter.

What is it that you are referring to that requires binaries for
a particular distribution?
