The USBprog adapter expects 7-bit sequences to be sent as part of its 
TMS_CHAIN command. More than one JTAG state transition from the table can 
be sent in a single USB command, but the adapter then treats each byte as 
a 7-bit TMS sequence to follow. Thus sending the shorter sequences from 
the short table results in the wrong transitions (e.g. IDLE -&gt; DRSHIFT = 
B8(001, 3) is interpreted as 0000001, and 4 incorrect shifts of data out 
of DR are done and lost).

By sticking to the old table (for this adapter only) with 7-bit 
transitions everywhere, this adapter that requires 7-bit transitions works.

What workaround? Expecting anyone that uses it to work out that they 
need an extra line in their config file? At least we should make this 
adapter default to the correct table, so that no-one is caught out.

&gt;<i> I believe the fix for USBprog belongs inside the C code rather than

I agree, but I'd rather see 0.2.0 go out more likely to work out of the 
box than not... The C fixes are longer, more involved and you are right 
that they are inappropriate to happen before the release.

My J-Link V6 is working under debian squeeze as of SVN r2503, with my 
target. I appreciate that some of the other stuff recently discussed about 
the J-Link may not make it, but at least we can say &quot;works under some 
circumstances, on some platforms&quot;.
