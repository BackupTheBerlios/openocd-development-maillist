<PRE>Hi Oyvind,

This patch is not ready to commit yet.

Unfortunately I had several emails open at a time and I inadvertently pushed
send on the wrong message before I had it polished.

Here is the short story of this patch left out of the first email:

I have a SAM-ICE device running V8 firmware that I am using on an Atmel
AT91SAM9G20-EK evaluation board.  When I execute openocd, approximately
every third attempt causes a complete communication failure, the green light
on the SAM-ICE extinguishes for about three seconds (internal watchdog
timeout in the dongle?), flickers a few times, and then resumes a solid
illumination.  The console displays the following messages during the event
and the debugger is left unusable afterwards:

    Jupiter:Embedded garycarlson$ openocd-jlink -f
    /usr/local/openocd-config/interface/jlink.cfg -f
    /usr/local/openocd-config/target/at91sam9260.cfg
    .
    .
    .
    Error: J-Link command EMU_CMD_VERSION failed (-60)
    Error: J-Link command EMU_CMD_VERSION failed (-1)
    Error: J-Link command EMU_CMD_VERSION failed (-32)
    Info : J-Link initial read failed, don't worry
    Info : J-Link JTAG Interface ready
    Error: usb_bulk_read failed (requested=1, result=-32)
    Error: jlink_tap_execute, wrong result -107 (expected 1)
    Error: usb_bulk_read failed (requested=1, result=-32)
    .
    .
    .


Based on the j-link code written by the original author, I suspect he may
have experienced the same or a similar problem.  The code has a while loop
and three retries in the jlink_init function to get communication to work
with the dongle.  The first version patch I submitted yesterday has
decreased the statistical startup failure rate in my case from 43% to 2%,
but has not completely eliminated the problem.

Unfortunately I only have one j-link device with one particular board.  What
I am hoping to find is some other people who use the j-link device with
other CPUs that have also experienced the problem and are willing to test
this patch and a possible revised patch prior to making a final commitment
decision.  What I don't want to do is break it for someone else through
unintended consequences.

The second version of this patch that I am working on will hopefully reduce
the failure rate from 2% to zero.  I will try to get that out either today
or tomorrow if my own testing proves fruitful.
