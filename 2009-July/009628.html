</I>&gt;<i> But usually such stuff is left undocumented for good reasons...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
It was in the rev0 docs, but got removed in the rev1 - added back in rev2.

It has been sent to the documentation team but is yet to be released - this
was over a year ago.
The info came from the cortex_m3 design team, and i have validated it on all
cortex_m3 revisions
that this reg does indeed exist. This was the reason i removed the original
implementation.

&gt;<i> Regardless, &quot;four bytes in one register&quot; is a *BIG* 
</I>&gt;<i> difference from &quot;four registers&quot;.  The existing code can't 
</I>&gt;<i> have worked.  And I looked at the revision history for the 
</I>&gt;<i> armv7m.c file, and nothing mentioned any changes to register 
</I>&gt;<i> handling.  Plus, just now I looked at the diffs not just the 
</I>&gt;<i> comments -- same.  Maybe that happened before this code left 
</I>&gt;<i> the M3 branch.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
The code is in cortex_m3.c.
The original code used 4 virtual regs to let the user see each special
register.
All that has changed in the patch is this is now hidden - it still works the
same.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also a note regarding the new handling of the reg20
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This sort of breaks cortex_m3 support
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In what way?  It worked just fine in my testing... that is, 
</I>&gt;<i> no worse than before, where access to those registers was 
</I>&gt;<i> broken, even though it claimed to work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
It works, just a visual thing - an array bug may be lurking.
reg produces:

(18) psp (/32): 0xB1805920 (dirty: 0, valid: 1)
(19) spec20 (/32): 0x00000000 (dirty: 0, valid: 1)
(20) (null) (/32): 0x00000000 (dirty: 0, valid: 1)     &lt;====================
invalid reg

&gt;<i> &gt; Due to the way the original code was written the order was very 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; important for armv7m core register cache - consecutive reg numbers 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only allowed in the array.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's broken-as-designed then.  The register number is 0x14, 
</I>&gt;<i> and nothing is at 0x13.  See table 10-3 in the r2p0 TRM (DDI 0337G).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
It is, i am just pointing it out.

&gt;<i> What code uses register *index* instead of register *number* 
</I>&gt;<i> to access things through DCRSR though?  That I didn't fix?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am in favour of reverting to individual reg names - 
</I>&gt;<i> easier for the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; end user.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But completely incorrect in technical terms.  See table 10-3.
</I>&gt;<i> They are fields in *ONE* register as identified using DCRSR.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I agree that the info comes from a single reg, perhaps we need some tcl
magic
to help the user decipher the info.

For info most vendors split this regster up into the seperate 8bit regs.

Cheers
Spen
