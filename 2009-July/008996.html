</I>
Private header files seem fairly standard way of separating declarations
from definitions.  I imagine that I could find some of what I have
described in all of the projects that you mention.  Heck, I have worked
on patches for the Linux kernel that included private header files, and
they were allowed for the reasons that should become clear below.

&gt;<i> A header file is something any one can &quot;#include&quot;, and thus defines a 
</I>&gt;<i> public interface, there is no means to enforce the 
</I>&gt;<i> 'this-is-private-do-not-touch' rule.
</I>
There is no rule that prevents you from committing layering violations.
The layers still need to be exposed, and it is your responsibility to
understand how the pieces fit together and use them properly.  How is
this situation any different?  There are small (if private) layers here.

&gt;<i> How does this &quot;help define the contract for the C file&quot;?
</I>
Changes to that file define the part and have impact on the entire
module, whereas the C file implements using that the specification in
the context of others (i.e. the flash interface).  Using an H file
separates declaration from definition clearly and aids future factoring
efforts to improve modularity.

Specifically, it allows this C module to be split into two pieces:
&quot;core&quot; and &quot;TCL command&quot; modules.  This then allows future development
of alternative command modules (e.g. native C calls to the core flash
module, or built-in command modules for other interpreted languages).

In this way, I wrote a Linux kernel module that used a &quot;private&quot; header
to share the &quot;contract&quot; between a USB device driver, its /proc driver,
and other optionally configurable sub-modules.  Sadly, that driver was
killed because of GPL licensing issues with the device firmware, but it
had passed review by GKH through private exchanges (back in '01, iirc).

Cheers,

Zach
