<PRE>Here is a patch to the README file to document my experiment
with MinGW cross build.

Please feel free to change it if you think it needs some modifications.

Tips For Building From The Subversion Repository
************************************************

Building OpenOCD from a repository requires a recent version of the GNU
autotools (autoconf &gt;= 2.59 and automake &gt;= 1.9).  For building on
Windows, you have to use Cygwin. Make sure that your PATH
environment variable contains no other locations with Unix utils (like
UnxUtils) - these can't handle the Cygwin paths, resulting in obscure
dependency errors.  This was an observation gathered from the logs of
one user; please correct us if this is wrong.

1) Run './bootstrap' to create the 'configure' script and prepare
   the build process for your host system.

2) Run './configure --enable-maintainer-mode' with other options.

(my patch follows).
The following URL is a good reference if you want to build OpenOCD
under cygwin.
<A HREF="http://forum.sparkfun.com/viewtopic.php?t=11221">http://forum.sparkfun.com/viewtopic.php?t=11221</A>

Alternatively you can build the Windows binary under Linux using
MinGW cross compiler. The following documents some tips of
using this cross build option.

a) libusb-win32
You can choose to use the libusb-win32 binary distribution from
its Sourceforge page. As of this writing, the latest version
is 0.1.12.2. This is the recommend version to use since it fixed
an issue with USB composite device and this is important for FTDI
based JTAG debuggers.
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb-win32/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb-win32/</A>

You need to download the libusb-win32-device-bin-0.1.12.2.tar.gz
package. Please extract this file into a temp directory.

Copy the file libusb-win32-device-bin-0.1.12.2\include\usb.h
to your MinGW include directory.

Copy the library libusb-win32-device-bin-0.1.12.2\lib\gcc\libusb.a
to your MinGW library directory.

Take note that different Linux distros often have different
MinGW installation directory. Some of them also put the
library and include into a seperate sys-root directory.

If there is a new svn version of libusb-win32, you can build it
as well.

This is the instrunction from the libusb-win32 Makefile.
# If you're cross-compiling and your mingw32 tools are called
# i586-mingw32msvc-gcc and so on, then you can compile libusb-win32
# by running
#    make host_prefix=i586-mingw32msvc all

b) libftdi
libftdi source codes can be download from the following website.
<A HREF="http://www.intra2net.com/en/developer/libftdi/download.php">http://www.intra2net.com/en/developer/libftdi/download.php</A>

It does not provide Windows binary. You can build it from the
source tarball or the git tree.

If you are using the git tree, the following is the instruction
from README.mingw. You need to have cmake installed.
- Edit Toolchain-mingw32.cmake to point to the correct MinGW
installation.
- Create a build directory like &quot;mkdir build-win32&quot;, e.g in ../libftdi/
- cd in that directory and run
  &quot;cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../Toolchain-mingw32.cmake ..&quot;
- Copy src/ftdi.h to your MinGW include directory.
- Copy build-win32/src/*.a to your MinGW lib directory.

c) OpenOCD
Now you can build OpenOCD under Linux using MinGW.
You need to use --host=your_mingW_prefix in the configure option.

Example for libftdi (in one line, tested under Ubuntu 9.04):
./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --enable-maintainer-mode
--disable-shared --enable-ft2232_libftdi

Example for ftd2xx (in one line, tested under Ubuntu 9.04)
./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --enable-maintainer-mode
--disable-shared --enable-ft2232_ftd2xx
--with-ftd2xx-win32-zipdir=/home/mcuee/Desktop/build/openocd/libftd2xx-win32
