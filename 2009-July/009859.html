    Host (GDB Client) --TCP/pipe--&gt; OpenOCD --JTAG--&gt; bare metal

If you're saying that the host should be able to provide binaries
or other data, instead of using $PWD of the OpenOCD server, I'd
tend to agree.  It's problematic that it uses $PWD, unless the
OpenOCD &quot;--pipe&quot; option is used to start (and thus GDB and OpenOCD
have the same $PWD).

</I>
This is what still makes no sense to me.  The target is &quot;bare metal&quot;,
and likely has its own notions of what makes a syscall and how its
params get passed.

To handle syscalls ... use a GDB server (or stub) running native
in that OS.  Not on bare metal, not talking over JTAG.
