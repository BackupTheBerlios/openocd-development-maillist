<PRE>Hi Xiaofan,

Based on your most recent information, I am pretty sure this a different
problem that my patch won't fix.  I have a sneaking suspicion that you are
running into some issue with libusb.  If you don't have access to a DSO, do
you have at least a DMM?

If you do, I think there is some value writing a simple test routine in
jlink_init after the USB handle is available that does the following:

    jlink_jtag_handle = jlink_usb_open();

    if (jlink_jtag_handle == 0)
    {
        blah...blah...blah...
    }

    /* Begin new test stuff here */

    while (1)
    {
        jlink_simple_command(EMU_CMD_HW_RESET0);
        sleep(1);
        jlink_simple_command(EMU_CMD_HW_RESET1);
        sleep(1);
    }

You should see the reset line transition on your target once a second from
high to low on your DMM without skipping a beat.  If it does this likely
will help you rule out libusb.

As for using USBMon, I can't disagree that it is hard to use and is
deficient compared to a true hardware protocol analyzer.  I wouldn't waste
my time with that.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Xiaofan,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The session transcript that you provided below seems to indicate a different
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem then my patch would fix in your case. &#160;Was this for the Arch Linux
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or all host systems? &#160;One of your earlier messages indicated success, so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> knowing that helps.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your patch works for Ubuntu 9.04 (without the patch it works as well but
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes got initialization error). I have not tested Fedora 10 but I believe
</I>&gt;<i> it would work. It failed under Arch Linux and OpenSuse 11.1 (without
</I>&gt;<i> your patches it did not work either. Your patch at lease helped to remove
</I>&gt;<i> the initialization error).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Take note all these 4 Linux distros are installed on the same computer.
</I>&gt;<i> I also use the same USB port to connect the J-Link.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Judging from your log, you seem to be getting outright write errors out of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the USB port to the dongle.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I obviously don't have your dongle, target, and computer in front of me or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> know your technical background, but here are some starting suggestions of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> things I would try to narrow the problem:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) If you have a DSO with a differential probe you may want to look at the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> data signals emitted onto the USB link. &#160;Are they reasonably clean at the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dongle?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) As part of the previous suggestion, if you write a simple test loop and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> emit one test command to the dongle at each startup, do you see signal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transitions at all or does the port seem to be dead during the failures? &#160;If
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you send one command at a time and everything works normally every time,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what happens if you modify the test loop to send the same command in rapid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> succession instead? &#160;Does the link then break?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was doing that at home so no DSOs. At work, I have DSOs but probably
</I>&gt;<i> I would not want to do this type of things at work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) If you have a good USB sniffer, have you done a closer inspection of what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is actually crossing the link? &#160;The simple test loop helps here so that you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are not overwhelmed by data.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe USBmon under Linux but it is a bit difficult to understand the log.
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, I will try some old versions of OpenOCD. I remember
</I>&gt;<i> it was working last time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, Segger's Linux utility seems to work fine.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4) Verify that your board is actually being reset during initialization by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> monitoring the reset line into the processor using the DSO or reset LED (if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your board has one). &#160;Over 20 years of working on multitudes of different
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> processors and emulators I can't think of all the times that I nearly pulled
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out my hair tracing odd problems only to find out that the board was not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reset like it should have been. &#160;If your link is working at all, the very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first thing you should see is the board tossed into reset by the dongle if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the first few USB writes are interpreted correctly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 5) What version of libusb do you have on your system(s)? &#160;If you are using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an older version, you may be running into bugs that have since been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> corrected in the USB support library.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think Arch Linux and OpenSuse 11.1 have the latest version of libusb.
</I>&gt;<i> Actually I normally run the latest version of libusb 0.1 and libusb 1.0
</I>&gt;<i> (svn version) under my main Linux distro which is Ubuntu 9.04.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 6) What hardware version of USB does your host system have (USB 1.0
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or USB 2.0)?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is a USB 2.0 high speed port. As I mentioned before, I
</I>&gt;<i> am using the same computer (An Acer M1641, GeForce 7050 / nForce 620i
</I>&gt;<i> ICP chipset, Intel Core 2 Duo E4700), same USB port.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway some things to think about.
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the hints.
