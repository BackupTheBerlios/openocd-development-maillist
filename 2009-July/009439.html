We all agree with that. But the reality is different.

&gt;<i> I think it is also safe to say that the primary testers Xiaofan, Spencer,

</I>
I think it is safe to assume so. libusb 0.1 and libusb-win32 0.1 have
not been changed for years.

&gt;<i> Likewise I have reviewed the USB manual over and over as others have looking
</I>&gt;<i> for the missing magic link. &#160;But based on the observations that Xiaofan and
</I>&gt;<i> others have made about the sorry state of libusb's current development
</I>&gt;<i> state, I personally don't think there is one to be found.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With all those things said, at this point as ugly as conditionals are, I
</I>&gt;<i> would rather have openocd work for as many platforms as possible to attract
</I>&gt;<i> user interest and capture mindshare. &#160;The alternative is to have no
</I>&gt;<i> conditionals and have users frustrated and leave when openocd is found to be
</I>&gt;<i> buggy on their particular platform.
</I>
I agree with you.

&gt;<i> Given the fact that fixing libusb is looking more like an improbability, I
</I>&gt;<i> took Spencer's latest patch and made two minor modifications (comments +
</I>&gt;<i> moved second open_usb up one notch so that it was excluded for Mac OS X
</I>&gt;<i> builds). &#160;I don't believe they will have any bearing on Windows or Linux
</I>&gt;<i> since the code emitted should be the same for those platforms. &#160;I am hoping
</I>&gt;<i> that both Spencer and Xiaofan will give the modification a lookover to
</I>&gt;<i> confirm that.
</I>
A minor fix needs to be done as I mentioned before.
usb_init(); needs to be moved up to the helper function find_jlink_device(void)
(before the line usb_find_busses();)

Could you rework the patch? Thanks.

&gt;<i> If they give a thumbs up, would you agree that committing the patch makes
</I>&gt;<i> the most sense at this point given what we know today about libusb?
</I>&gt;<i>
