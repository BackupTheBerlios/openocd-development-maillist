<PRE>Hi all,

Last week, I had a conference call with Dan Ravicher, Legal Director of
the Software Freedom Law Center, and two of his colleagues.  He helped
answer some questions that came up for me during the licensing debate.
Further, he has generously offered to take questions from the community
regarding our licensing situation; individuals may contact him directly
at the SFLC via e-mail, phone, or mail.

The key points: OpenOCD is GPL, and binaries linked to FTDI's library
cannot be distributed legally.  I have legal standing to enforce GPL
compliance independently of other authors, though I am not alone in
wanting compliance.  I intend to enforce the GPL for 0.2.0 and future
releases, so this message serves as a warning to anyone that intends to
distribute a solution that may violate the license terms.  This is also
a reminder that past violations will be forgiven; only future violators
will be met with letters from the SFLC, on the behalf of those copyright
holders that wish to enforce the GPL license.

As I said before, my compliance efforts will not be for personal gain.
Any profits will be donated to a free software organization, preferably
one where the funds can be used to help the OpenOCD community.  Early
and full compliance will be preferred, and several possible solutions
have been presented and can be located in the mailing list archives.

If you have a copyright stake in OpenOCD and want to enforce the GPL,
please feel free to talk with Dan about your concerns.  While some may
be unwilling to cooperate, others retain their rights to seek legal
redress for violations.  I continue to hope that such remedies never
need to be employed, as these matters distract from productive
development activity.

In addition to the SFLC, I contacted FTDI and received confirmation that
developers may enter into an NDA to obtain their protocol documentation.
With that, libftdi can be made to perform competitively.  With this
information confirmed, I reiterate: I think this should be the preferred
solution, despite any apparent viability of other potential options.

Cheers,

Zach
