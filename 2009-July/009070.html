<PRE>Dear Sirs,

I am:

Still looking into why ./bootstrap will not work when building openocd
(latest)
on cygwin.

I did not see much about openocd on cygwin lists except:

Hello Orin,

Thanks for the reply.

My TEMP and TMP directory settings that I am looking at on my vista laptop
are /cygdrive/c/Users/OWNER_~1/AppData/Local/Temp.
I wonder if it does not like &quot;OWNER_~1&quot; which is really OWNER_858_689_0947

I did this in a couple ways, at first I changed the name of my account on
VISTA from OWNER_858_689_0947 to jmk, but this did not change the directory
name. I notice c:/Users, on vista at least,  resists having directories
renamed

So..

I changed the variables TMP and TEMP in windows temporariily while I
am running cygwin so they point at c:\temp  rather than c:\Users
now $ echo $TEMP returns a nicer &quot;/cygdrive/c/temp&quot;


After this I repeated repeated

./bootstrap
========
$ ./bootstrap
+ aclocal
/usr/bin/m4:configure.in:428: canot create temporary file for diversion:
Permission denied
autom4te-2.6.3: /usr/bin/m4 failed with exit status: 1
aclocal-1.11: autom4te failed with exit status: 1
Bootstrap complete; you can './configure -enable-maintainer-mode ....&quot;
========

I noticed that  there  does exist a &quot;m4.exe&quot; file in the /usr/bin directory
it looks like
m4.exe is haveing trouble doing whatever it is supposed to do.
IMPORTANT - I noticed that now the message is
/usr/bin/m4:configure.in:718: canot create temporary file for diversion:
Permission denied

HEY, I got from line 428 to line 718 - Does that indicate progress ? :}
Does the 428 or 718 refer to a line in m4.exe , or does it refer to
the line in configure.in located in the trunk directory for openocd ???

I'd guess it's a line in configure.in, but line 418 of configure.in didn't
look interesting on my system.


BTW:
I put back  My TEMP and TMP directory  settings to original so that
$echo $TEMP gives &quot;/cygdrive/c/Users/OWNER_~1/AppData/Local/Temp.&quot;
now it displays:
/usr/bin/m4:configure.in:418: canot create temporary file for diversion:
Permission denied

Orin,
You may be right about

&quot;My money is on the '~' in any path passed as a command line parameter to
the shell in the autotools scripts.&quot;

How do I eliminate more of these ? Perhaps just changing TMP and TEMP is not
enough.


I wondered about length of the name of the directory you have the OpenOCD
source in,
but mine is in c:\projects\OpenOCD_SRC which is longer than 8 characters,
so that shouldn't be a problem.

Have you tried downloading a complete fresh copy of OpenOCD in a new
directory from svn?
Perhaps the autotools have cached something.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> YES, BUT DOING THIS DID NOT HELP
</I>
I'm going to see if it works on my Vista laptop - I believe I already have
cygwin on it.




Best regards,

Joe

P.S Would it be ok if I re-post some of this to the openOCD list ??


Sure, go ahead.

Orin.
