</I>
Lacking feedback, I committed this earlier, and I have my script all but
ready to commit to the repository and perform the release.  Here is the
NEWS blurb that I could not resist trying to write, though I realize
that I have probably left out a number of important contributions.
That's not from oversight or any slight, just that I am growing rushed
and this was my quick job of it.

After a minor berliOS permission shortcoming, I have gained sufficient
privilege to release the archives to the project site.  I created the
new release this afternoon and read some more about its &quot;requirements&quot;.
After some thought, I think the NEWS file needs to be rewritten for each
major/minor release in manner like this, as it can be used (after being
further condensed) to use in RSS feeds and similar distribution. 

I should have had the community working on this before now, but I was
actually planning to punt on it.  In hindsight, I realize that was not
the right choice.  Ideally, future patches will include an entry in this
file when they accomplish something NEWS-worthy, to help build our list
of accolades as we go along.  Live and learn.

Anyway, I have personal commitments this weekend, so I need to put the
release process aside for the next 36-48 hours and meet my prior
obligations.  Sorry for this delay, but I hope that it will prove worth
the wait in the long run.  In the meantime, please provide feedback for
improving the NEWS blurb or other release-related materials.

Cheers,

Zach

-------------- next part --------------
The OpenOCD 0.2.0 source archive release includes numerous improvements
that have been made since the initial 0.1.0 source archive release.

This release does not maintain backward compatibility in all respects,
so some target or configuration scripts may need to be updated.

The following areas of functionality were changed in this release:

JTAG Layer:
- Improve modularity: core, TCL, driver commands, and interface have
  been separated, encapsulated, and documented for developers.  Mostly.
- The JTAG TAP transition tables have been made variable, rather than
  being fixed at 7 steps.
- Improved JTAG driver/minidriver support
- Improved drivers:
  - ft2232+ftd2xx:
    - initial high-speed device support: --enable-ftd2xx-highspeed
  - jlink:
    - now works with more versions of the firmware (v4 and newer)
    - dynamically detects device capabilities and limits
  - vsllink:
    - support for very long scan chains
- New drivers:
   - New stub minidriver for developing new embedded JTAG interfaces.

Target Layer:
- Numerous bug fixes for many platforms

Flash Layer:
- Improved drivers: mflash
- New drivers: AT91SAM3, AVR

Documentation:
- Updated User Guide:     <A HREF="http://openocd.berlios.de/doc/html/index.html">http://openocd.berlios.de/doc/html/index.html</A>
- Added Developer Manual: <A HREF="http://openocd.berlios.de/doc/doxygen/index.html">http://openocd.berlios.de/doc/doxygen/index.html</A>
- Significantly improved and expanded in this release:
  - Now includes architecture, technical primers, style guides, and more.
  - Available in-tree and on-line.

Build and Release:
- Use libtool to produce helper libraries as a step toward &quot;libopenocd&quot;.
- New processes and scripting to facilitate future source releases.

In addition to these specific list items, countless bug fixes and
cleanups have been performed across the tree.  The TCL scripts have been
moved to their own directory, separate from the C source code.  Various
parameters now received stricter checking, and many more error
conditions are being handled correctly.  These efforts should help to
make this release the more stable than past releases, though some change
may expose latent bugs in your configuration scripts.

Many contributors helped make this release a great success, and the
community looks forward to seeing you use this release.  See the new
Developer Manual (or the BUGS and PATCHES files in the source archive)
for more information about contributing reports, bug fixes, and new
features or device support.

For more details about what has changed since 0.1.0, see the ChangeLog
associated with this release.
