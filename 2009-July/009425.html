ISTR it was never one project to begin with.  It started out on
Linux as a usbfs wrapper ... not as a cross-platform programming
interface for USB.

And given that Linux want to eventually do away with usbfs (it's
a real mess internally), it's no surprise that there's no clear
forward direction for that code.

If &quot;Someone&quot; were to create such a cross-platform USB interface,
that would likely attract users.
