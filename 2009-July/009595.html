</I>&gt;<i>   - One patch per post; the original post feel short here.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I loath the idea of asking others to fix code of an active developer.

</I>&gt;<i> such efforts would mean that it ceases to be &quot;his&quot; patches to manage.
</I>&gt;<i> To me, this sounds like a rude thing to do, since he did not abandon
</I>&gt;<i> those bits to the community's care.  While we have provided the
</I>&gt;<i> community with a patch that will apply against the trunk HEAD, that
</I>&gt;<i> should be sufficient to enable him to finish the rest of the work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the meantime, this patch should be used for testing only, and not

Hi list,

I will not do any more work on these patches in the near future.

I know that there is a lot of work to be done before they are up to
standard, but I have been asked to submit the work I have done so far,
anyway. So I give this to the community to improve. Hopefully the
experiments I have done with the Beagleboard and my analysis of how
Cortex-A8 relates to other ARM subsystems in OpenOCD can be useful as a
basis for a future full and clean Cortex-A8 subsystem.

So I have full understanding if somebody does a major rework or if
somebody decides to write another implementation. But the patches as they
stand actually makes it possible to do basic debugging of Cortex-A8
systems (Beagleboard) and some members of the community have expressed
interest in this well aware of the limitations in the present code.

I hope this project has not lost the facility to work on and collectively
improve incomplete subsystems.

So as an old teacher I can only say that I wish the Cortex-A8 code all
future success, in whatever form it will transform into after meeting with
the community. This is not abandoning, it is setting free to allow future
growth.

Have a nice summer.
Best regards
Magnus
