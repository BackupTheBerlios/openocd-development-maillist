As Magnus has now indicated that he does not intend to finish working on
these patches, I know others will descend on them like piranha.

I should have mentioned that developers need to be clear when they post
patches that are being punted to the community, as such is certainly
acceptable practice.  His first message posting the patches did not
indicate this intention clearly, but his latest post cleared the path
for others to step up.  That's clearly not going to be a problem. ;)

These ideas should probably be incorporated into our guidelines for
submitting patches, as it is very important to know who will be taking
responsibility for fixing a patch that has been posted.  We should not
allow future complaints of either &quot;I thought the maintainers were taking
care of this patch&quot; or &quot;I should have been allowed to fix it&quot;.

&gt;<i> This patch is a trivial re-factoring, but getting this committed should
</I>&gt;<i> reduce the rest of the patch to Cortex A8 specfic stuff. Magnus
</I>&gt;<i> felt that it was ready to commit.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If we can have some smoke testing it should be alright to commit.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Comments?

It looks like David has dealt with my complaints. :)  Committed.

Cheers,

Zach
