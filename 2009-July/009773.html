<PRE>&#216;yvind Harboe a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> I've committed a few fixes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Patches gladly accepted for any other warnings you can sort out...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I will let you know, right now I am trying to figure out why the openocd 
ftdi driver will not work at all on Mandriva 2009.1
The proprietary stuff works like a champ.
&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The guilty file is build.properties
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fix committed (removed obsolete references).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>good
&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The update site works fine on e.g. Eclipse 3.5 w/Ubuntu 9.04.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Doesn't work on Ubuntu 8.10
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could you elaborate? Eclipse 3.5 does not work or the plugin?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What happens?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Tons of errors. I downloaded version 3.5 and installed locally and 
problem was fixed.
I actually preferred version 3.5 of Eclipse so I never went back to the 
3.2 version that was installed.
It would have been nice to have the standard ubuntu Eclipse install work 
with it.

&gt;<i> I can't see any reason for problems with Ubuntu as such. This even
</I>&gt;<i> works on Mac &amp; Ubuntu 9.04.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Last I tried with Ubuntu 8.10 and fedora 9 it would barf, so I relied to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> old fashion way which is to copy the compiled java
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to their proper directory.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What barfed?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We had some domain name problems with our server that we sorted
</I>&gt;<i> out. Could it that you hit that problem window?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Don't remember the details except that I got lotsa messages of errors, 
not just warnings.
&gt;&gt;<i> I am referring to the .jar files. It is important which version of Eclipse
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is used.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you have 3.3, 3.4 or 3.5 you need different ones.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is no way I could hope to support anything than the latest
</I>&gt;<i> version of Eclipse with the resources available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I understood that, it is why I opted to recompile my own plugin. That 
way I can have a working system without any concern
with what Linux version I have. Perhaps your way around for people who 
have issues would be to give a short description on how
to generate  ones own plugin from source. The upgrade is dependant on 
what a distribution has done to &quot;beautify&quot; their version of
Eclipse. I have little confidence on the eclipse upgrade approach for 
this kind of stuff as you have no control on what Mandriva, Redhat
or SuSE do with their Eclipse. Redhat for instance compiles everything 
for the opensource of java which has nowhere near the quality
of the Sun Java. I've had lotsa crashes with Redhat's Eclipse and it is 
often due to the non Sun Plugins. This will change eventually.

Maybe the best approach for eveyone would be to install Eclipse locally 
with the official stuff but to convince anyone to do that would be
quite a challenge.
&gt;&gt;<i> ECDT_Debugger_Name       = gdb
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a silly default, but there isn't really a good default here.
</I>&gt;<i> I chose arm-elf-gdb.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>It is easy to change, I was just mentionning that it looks bad because 
gdb is the local debugger and not an embedded one.
A common free debugger is arm-elf-gdb while the most familiar commercial 
versions have eabi in it. It would be better to have arm-elf-gdb
or arm-linux-gdb since if you forget to change the default you will not 
get weird messages that will confuse the hell out of a newbie.
A missing filename message is better than a criptic message which unless 
you realize that it is trying to debug x86 stuff makes no sense.
