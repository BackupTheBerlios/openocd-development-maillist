<PRE>Hi list,

I know there is a lot of fixing to get a stable 0.2.0 so this is  
clearly for next release.
But I also know that some folks wants to get going with CortexA8, so 
here it comes.

================================================================================

Index: src/target/Makefile.am

Index: src/target/armv7a.c
Index: src/target/armv7a.h
Index: src/target/cortex_a8.c
Index: src/target/cortex_a8.h

Index: src/target/armv7m.c
Index: src/target/arm_adi_v5.c
Index: src/target/arm_adi_v5.h

This code has mainly been developed and tested against R1606, it has 
been built and tested against R2294 where it runs but step and resume 
commands are broken due to regression in codebase, this should be fixed 
in current head.

I do have not have access to the ARMv7A/R archtecture manual so it is 
hard to make a precise distinction between CorexA8 and ARMv7A features.

The  ARMv7A architecture and register set is a variant of the armv4/5/6 
and it is not a variant of the ARMv7M used by CortexM3.
The debug interface is ARM_ADI_V5, most (hopefully all) changes to 
handle the differences from the CortexM3 implementation has already been 
added to arm_adi_v5.c.

This code is really written for OMAP3530.
The identification of debug resources from the ROM table is not 
implemented, there is code to scan a rom table in 
arm_adi_v5.c:dap_info_command but it is not used for setting adresses of 
debug resources.
In the most general situation every memory mapped debug resource, 
including ROM and RAM, must be associated with a dap number and a memap 
address, this can, and probably most often will, be equal to the 
processor memory bus address but this is not necessary.

The OMAP3530 uses two memap access ports, dap 0 and dap 1.
dap ap #0 is connected to L3 interconnect, with passthrough to L4 Emu
dap ap #1 is connected to L4 Emu interconnect , with access to L4 Wakeup 
and holds the ROM table
This means that most memory bus accesses should be done through dap ap 
#0, but access to L4 Emu interconnect and scanning the ROM table should 
be done through dap ap #1.

The are at present some defines to handle this in cortex_a8.c, they 
should be replaced with more general code, but that should probably be 
done when we have access to other Cortexa8 implementations.

#define swjdp_memoryap 0
#define swjdp_debugap 1
#define OMAP3530_DEBUG_BASE 0x54011000

--------------------------------------
PATCH AGAINST 2294
arm_adi_v7m_R2294.patch

Index: src/target/arm_adi_v5.c
Index: src/target/arm_adi_v5.h
Index: src/target/armv7m.c

The changes in these files move the dap command handler implementations 
to arm_adi_v5.c, leaving just thin wrappers in armv7m.c.
There should be no change in functionality here. Should be harmless to 
commit.

--------------------------------------
NEW FILES

Index: src/target/armv7a.c
Index: src/target/armv7a.h

Here we find the core register architecture and command line handlers 
for the dap commands implemented in arm_adi_v5.c.
These fuiles does not affect any other but cortex_a8.h/c code in 
OpenOCD. Should be harmless to commit.
--------------------------------------
COMPLETE REPLACEMENT

Index: src/target/cortex_a8.c
Index: src/target/cortex_a8.h

This is the target implementation. This code is similar to the CortexM3 
and ARM7_9 targets.
This replaces the previous nonfunctional cortex_a8 code with something 
that at least basically works even if it is incomplete.
Does not affect any other subsystem, thus harmless to commit.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comments

This code has been tested with a Flyswatter interface and a BeagleBoard.
Under uBoot, virtual memory disabled:
+ mdw/mww works
+ load_image/dump_image of a 100k jpeg picture to ram
+ load_image of a small application (led blink) to ram run using resume 
&lt;startaddr&gt;
+ halt/step/resum works  (R1606)
+ breakpoints works
Testing is not exstensive but on my system it works.


After Linux is started things get WEIRD !!!

I know that there are lots of very raw edges but instead of holding off 
until it is nice and clean, I submit this for everybody to play with.

Good luck and have fun.
Magnus
