<PRE>Dear Devepment and support people,

On &quot;sparkfun&quot;  I am following &quot;mifi's&quot; instrutions to a tee.
<A HREF="http://forum.sparkfun.com/viewtopic.php?t=11221">http://forum.sparkfun.com/viewtopic.php?t=11221</A>
never the less:

I took another shot at attempting to compile my own version
of openOCD with ftd2xx.  Both attemps on my work laptop (Vista)
and my home PC (XP) resulted in identical failure.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This is important and relates,
</I>to a bunch of people who would like to be able to succesfully use
openOCD with ftd2xx, right now &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;:

<A HREF="http://forum.sparkfun.com/viewtopic.php?t=16172">http://forum.sparkfun.com/viewtopic.php?t=16172</A>

Fact of the matter is we can not get the compile to work and get stuck
trying to use the unix like commands &quot;./bootstrap&quot; and &quot;./configure&quot;
One nice and impressive thing is that subversion was able to
properly download all the source files for openOCD via cygwin,
as advertised, so we are almost there.

This is a plea for help.

Here is an excerpt from openOCDs own website, that indicates
they may admit that using cygwin is not easy. It would sure help
if someone would come to our rescue and prove to us that it can
be done.

Building OpenOCD from a repository requires a recent version of the GNU
autotools (autoconf &gt;= 2.59 and automake &gt;= 1.9).  For building on
Windows, you have to use Cygwin. Make sure that your @env{PATH}
environment variable contains no other locations with Unix utils (like
UnxUtils) - these can't handle the Cygwin paths, resulting in obscure
dependency errors.  This was an observation gathered from the logs of
one user; please correct us if this is wrong.
Ref bottom of page here:
<A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/openocd/trunk/README">http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/openocd/trunk/README</A>

It seem this statement is saying &quot;We have not figured it out yet, either&quot;
So the community is still looking for more guidance.
I think there is someone out there who is more unix savy than me
that can get us un-stuck. Cygwin is more like unix than windows.


&quot;A penny will get you on the subway, but garlic will get you a seat&quot;

Sincerely,
Joe
