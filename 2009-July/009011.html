I copied and rephrased that statement from the User's Guide, but I did
not originate it or try to confirm it.  The in-tree documentation
remains woefully incomplete when it comes to Win32 build support.

While we have multiple indications that the SparkFun instructions can be
made to work, I have seen repeated indications that they also fail to
cover some of the extenuating circumstances that are encountered in the
real world.  It seems that some details are missing, or you would be
able to find and resolve your problems by using those instructions.

That said, the SparkFun forum is NOT an acceptable place to distribute
build instructions for OpenOCD.  In-tree documentation should be
produced and included for users, as this will eliminate the requirement
for these users to visit the internet in order to build this project.
I have grown baffled that this has not been remedied before now, since I
made an explicit request to this effect on the list recently.

As you mentioned, the SparkFun instructions were written by &quot;mifi&quot;; that
user, Michael Fischer, is also subscribed here, and he should have the
copyright for the forum-based instructions.  It should be easy enough
for him to add those instructions to the repository, so others can then
provide patches to clarify and improve them.  I have added him to the CC
line for this message to ensure he is aware of this request.

Myself, I want README.CygWin for this purpose, but I would like us to
develop instructions to put into README.MinGW32 as well.  These days, a
solution that avoids CygWin entirely would be to run a VM on Windows
with a Linux image that builds the mingw32 cross-compiler and compiles
suitable Windows binaries of the required packages.  I have worked on
projects that provided an in-tree MinGW32 build script that produced
tools and all dependencies from source.  Such a script can even produce
a standard installer (using Nullsoft's tools), from what I remember.

Cheers,

Zach
