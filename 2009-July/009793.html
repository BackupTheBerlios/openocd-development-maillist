<PRE>Hello Jon,

JB&gt; I'm porting OpenOCD to a new processor architecture and I've noticed that
JB&gt; there doesn't appear to be any support for the X and F GDB Stop Reply
JB&gt; Packets
JB&gt; (<A HREF="http://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb_34.html#SEC724">http://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb_34.html#SEC724</A>),
JB&gt; which are used to indicate that a process has exited (X) or to perform
JB&gt; system calls on the host (F). 
You're looking at this from the wrong side. The GDB &quot;server&quot;
in OpenOCD is what is called &quot;stub&quot; in the documentation. It does not
need to support F or X; those need to be implemented on the host
side _if_ the stub is going to send them. And I don't see a situation
when OpenOCD would send those. (Well, I guess it could send X if it
loses connection with the target...)

JB&gt; Also, there doesn't currently appear to be any support for signals other
JB&gt; than SIGINT &amp; SIGTRAP. I think it would be useful if other common signals
JB&gt; such as SIGBUS, SIGILL and SIGSEGV could also be passed on, when applicable.
Those are all user-mode signals. Since OpenOCD works on the lowest
level (JTAG), it doesn't know about processes. It can only report events from
hardware (such as breakpoints). I guess one _could_ install a custom
prefetch abort handler and convert it to a SIGBUS... but it's much more likely
that OpenOCD user is debugging a kernel or an RTOS which has its own
handler.

JB&gt; Looking at server/gdb_server.c, it should be fairly straight forward to do
JB&gt; by adding a few additional DBG_REASON_s. There shouldn't be any issues for
JB&gt; targets that don't support them - as the code will not be executed.

JB&gt; If I create a patch to add support for this, is it likely to be accepted, or
JB&gt; is there a reason there is no support for this?
