Right... but it's bootstrap's autotools that are the real problem.  
The above steps are the easy part; bootstrapping is for developers only,
and only required from the SVN repository.

&gt;<i> &gt; That is an unacceptable 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; process for users, as it will result in more false reports from failed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (re)building than it will help test the bug.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Build bugs need fixing, regardless.  Especially if &quot;we&quot; are
</I>&gt;<i> not in the support-binary-builds end of the business.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But for the record ... standard process for bug reporters
</I>&gt;<i> in Linux most typically involves getting the submitter to
</I>&gt;<i> build *current* stuff to verify the bug still exists.  If
</I>&gt;<i> the kernel isn't current, it's very likely that at least
</I>&gt;<i> some of the symptoms changed; maybe the bug is fully fixed!
</I>
The contributor of a patch is acting as a developer, so they should be
able to build it.  I agree completely that developers should be testing
and submitting patches against the trunk HEAD.

&gt;<i> It's impractical to support users who are on code so old
</I>&gt;<i> the developers can't use it.  At least, not without some
</I>&gt;<i> kind of paid support contract ... and at that point, it's
</I>&gt;<i> not the developers who are supporting the old code base.
</I>
I agree, which is why need to find a balance between the forces of
development, bug fixes, and frequent releases.  Because there are active
&quot;users&quot; and a lot of development remains to be done, we need to make
releases frequently enough that they never feel tempted to use the SVN.

&gt;<i> Plus ... this *is* open source.  One of the strengths of
</I>&gt;<i> those processes is that they make it easy to morph from
</I>&gt;<i> user to developer, as the need arises.  So IMO it's more
</I>&gt;<i> than counterproductive to draw a circle with &quot;developers&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> inside, and everyone else outside.  Going back and forth
</I>&gt;<i> should be no big deal whatsoever.  It should be *easy* to
</I>&gt;<i> contribute.  If it seems hard ... that's worth fixing.
</I>
I did make this point clearly. :)  Labels are useless when you _can_
swap back and forth between using and developing the project.  However,
real &quot;users&quot; _can't_ do development, even if they can run build a source
release using configure and make. 

It is _those_ individuals that should never be asked to build from the
SVN repository.  We have established that this community does have such
individuals (via one or more vendor); those individuals can test a
nightly build or wait for their distributor (i.e. a developer) to
produce one for them with their fix using 'make dist'.  Right?

Cheers,

Zach
