I unfortunately deleted my rev0 M3 TRM.  :(


&gt;<i> It has been sent to the documentation team but is yet to be released - this

</I>&gt;<i> The info came from the cortex_m3 design team, and i have validated it on all
</I>&gt;<i> cortex_m3 revisions
</I>&gt;<i> that this reg does indeed exist. This was the reason i removed the original

</I>
Good, that will promote saner code on our end.  :)

I'll plan on removing the version check, but I want to
do that in conjunction with some yet-to-be-written test
code to let me trigger the various processor modes.  So
it'll be a few days yet.


&gt;<i> &gt; Regardless, &quot;four bytes in one register&quot; is a *BIG* 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; difference from &quot;four registers&quot;.  The existing code can't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have worked.  And I looked at the revision history for the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; armv7m.c file, and nothing mentioned any changes to register 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; handling.  Plus, just now I looked at the diffs not just the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; comments -- same.  Maybe that happened before this code left 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the M3 branch.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The code is in cortex_m3.c.
</I>&gt;<i> The original code used 4 virtual regs to let the user see each special
</I>&gt;<i> register.
</I>
I didn't see anything to morph the &quot;real&quot; register into four
&quot;virtual&quot; ones though... the code was treating it as having
for unique DCRSR identifiers, which is incorrect.


&gt;<i> (20) (null) (/32): 0x00000000 (dirty: 0, valid: 1)     &lt;====================
</I>
I see:

(18) psp (/32): 0x00000000 (dirty: 0, valid: 0)
(19) spec20 (/32): 0x00000000 (dirty: 0, valid: 0)
(20) GDB dummy floating-point register (/32): 0x00000000 (dirty: 0, valid: 0)

Which is a different type of bug.  There *IS* no floating point...


&gt;<i> I agree that the info comes from a single reg, perhaps we need some tcl
</I>&gt;<i> magic to help the user decipher the info.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For info most vendors split this regster up into the seperate 8bit regs.
</I>
Agreed that would be nicer.
