</I>&gt;<i> &gt; legitimate bugs that you are fixing.  No dispute about that.  In that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; regard, I am happy to reset the release deadline while we consider the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; patches.  However, there does need to be a limit to the number of resets
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that we allow for new issues.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If I may be very blunt: I don't think we are very close to a 0.2.0
</I>&gt;<i> release. It seems (based on bug reports) the recent changes broke some
</I>&gt;<i> of the existing functionality. That needs to be tested &amp; fixed first. 
</I>
I think that we need to fix the bugs that we have spotted, but each
release window has its limits.  The 7/1 deadline had been discussed in
on the list more than once, and I am fairly certain that I gave ample
warning to the community in the past week or so.  The late rush and
subsequent delays are simultaneously expected and disappointing.

&gt;<i> IMHO release 0.2.0 should have at least the same functionality that
</I>&gt;<i> 0.1.0 had.
</I>
This kind of expectation does not hold indefinitely, as not even the
Linux kernel maintains support for all platforms indefinitely.  I bet
every minor release sees a regressions in a small part of the tree.
Given that OpenOCD shares the same hardware testing requirements, I
think it would be insane to expect that we never have regressions for
some platforms.  Moreover, some of the reset bugs being discussed appear
to have been introduced before the 0.1.0 release.

We can't wait for everyone that missed the release window, when others
get their work in on time.  That is simply not fair to the maintainers
that are keeping up with the schedule.  This is why the world has
deadlines, and there will always be consequences for missing them.
Fortunately, we can make new releases in due course, so any mistakes
will be corrected with sufficient patience from the community.

All of this is for the future.  For now, we're playing things by ear,
and it sounds like we need to give 0.2.0 a little more time to brew.

Cheers,

Zach
