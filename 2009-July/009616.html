The fact that my last message hit the list before the commits reflects
that it broke in two new and exciting ways.  First, the SVN connection
was reset after the second commit, so I had to restart the series
commit.  Second, the final two patches originally included improperly
encoded characters; Subversion wants UTF-8, and it discovered that my
current environment was not set up for such just yet.  Live and learn.

After reading more about this, it seems that most Linux folks should be
using UTF-8 by default.  For example, my Ubuntu 9.04 shows 'UTF-8' as
the output from 'locale charmap', whereas my Gentoo system showed
'ANSI_X3.4-1968'.  So, my setup needed to be fixed (d'oh!), and others
may need to correct the same deficiency.

Cheers,

Zach
