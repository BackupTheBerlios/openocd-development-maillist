<PRE>Hi Zach,

thanks for a good post &amp; followup on this.

I'll try to adjust to the new rules of engagement and stop committing
willy nilly.

W.r.t. when 0.2 should go out of the door, I'm thinking that we
should have a few days without finding and fixing regressions
before we say it's time to release.

Here is a list of recent commits I've made where the impact is non-localized
to obscure features and non-trivial. Some additional  explanations too.


2464 - fixed regression since 0.1. No human readable error message
were reported when feeding in an illegal number.
2469 - deleted unclear unused code. There was a complicated
check on what the debug_reason was. The new check *only*
checks against the only value/case that needs to be treated specially.
This was a bug waiting to happen. If a new DBG_REASON was
introduced, then this check would do the wrong thing. related
to arm926ejs work.
2470 - added a timeout check on the polling loop for cp15 read/write.
This was for arm926ejs work, but the timeout problem is no longer
visible as the underlying interface problem was fixed.
2478 - fix post 0.1 regression in OpenOCD &quot;step&quot; command. This
command is *crucial* for the trunk/testing scripts.
2479 - arm926ejs reports unknown MOE. Rather than just failing
outright, allow step/halt to at least function while we look for this
bug.

My current feeling about 0.2 is that we should allow at least
a week of work on the outstanding reset problems before we cut
the release.

Also I'm especially pleased that we caught 2478
before anything went out of the door, because *ALL* smoke
tests would have failed without that fix in place... Based on
the experience in the last couple of days w/the reset problems,
I'm not quite ready to hand over svn head to Michael Fischer
for running the smoketest suite.

0.2 is special. There has been LOTS of system wide changes this
spring.

Is there a downside to staying in &quot;near 0.2 release mode&quot;
for a month or so?

What type of changes would we have to postpone?

Surely we could do more system wide cleanup work this fall?
