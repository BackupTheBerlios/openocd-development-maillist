We can and should improve that knowledge level, IMO.  :)

For now I'll assume folk are aware of the GIT documentation
and tutorials; there's a link to them on gitweb pages.  It
should be easier to reference some existing how-to docs
than to write Yet Another Tutorial ...  I was hoping that
&quot;git for SVN users&quot; URL I referenced would help.


My concern was more about patch content, and in this case
the patch descriptive data.  Good inputs to the system, in
short; most users can live with &quot;git clone&quot; and &quot;git pull&quot;,
plus maybe &quot;git diff&quot; if they write patches.


I think there's some overlap here with folk using git for
work with Linux (== kernel) and U-Boot.  I think all those
skills should transfer directly; and there are writeups in
those projects for &quot;how 2 maek gud patches&quot;.  Ones that come
quickly to mind:

 <A HREF="http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/stuff/tpp.txt">http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/stuff/tpp.txt</A>
	&quot;The Perfect Patch&quot;

 linux/Documentation/SubmittingPatches
	There's a good basic checklist in part 1, and
	information about the Signed-off-By stuff.

In terms of &quot;email-to-GIT&quot; models, some points to remember
(also mentioned in those two files):

  - $SUBJECT becomes the one-line patch summary, so have
    it be useful.  &quot;fix memleak &lt;IN FOO&gt;&quot;; reference FOO!
    It's also used for tracking discussions about that
    particular patch (email etc)

  - One-line summaries aren't enough to explain patches.
    Make sure that folk browsing the repository history 
    can make sense of the patch by including a useful
    summary of the patch too.

Right now a &quot;git log&quot; is often not informative; let's
fix that.  (An &quot;svn log&quot; was pretty much unusable because
of network issues; we can blame part of that on history.)


Also, I'll suggest we adopt the audit trail model that
includes &quot;Signed-off-By&quot; etc.  Minimally, committers
can use &quot;git-am -s&quot; to sign off on what they commit;
that way we can know which maintainer was involved,
not just who wrote the original bit.

It's probably useful practice for submitters to include
that too, the &quot;Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1&quot;
basically affirms that there are no known legal issues.
 
Other bits -- acks, tested-by, cc, etc -- can be used
when they're helpful.
