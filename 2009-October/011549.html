I thought we were aiming to release a month ago...

My implicit suggestion was that if we're going to
have any &quot;RC&quot; at all, we should do it like that.

As you noted, testing is going to be problematic
since we don't have much of the hardware in hand.

As one data point, both Linux and U-Boot have the
same issue, and they've settled on a (git-based)
devel cycle which features a &quot;merge window&quot; of a
few weeks right after each release, terminated by
the first &quot;RC&quot;.  The point of the RC phase is to
get *lots* of testing done, merging bugfixes-only.

This project is IMO not ready for a release cycle
that's half (or more!) RC.  But I think we could
easily be ready to declare that we'll have a few
weeks of RC that are bugfix-only.


&gt;<i> I'm very pleased we have successfully migrated to git
</I>&gt;<i> before 0.3.
</I>
Yes; though as Nico pointed out, doing some work in
branches would be a good thing.  (I'm thinking of
checking out &quot;stgit&quot; myself ... )

During a bugfix-only RC phase, it'd be natural for
folk to have ongoing development in branches.  Then
there would be some post-release merges of those
branches into the mainline.

Having a short 0.3.0-rc1, and maybe 0.3.0-rc2, could
be a good way to get our collective feet wet in such
processes.  :)


&gt;<i> &gt; Yes; we're overdue to close this dev cycle, IMO.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I get the feeling &#370;yvind is impatient for 0.4.0-dev &#160;... :)

</I>&gt;<i> One day I'll be able to post messages/email and have

</I>
Sorry; when I sent that email, it displayed correctly.

Something in the mail system seems to be mangling
charsets.  That message went out in ISO-8859-1 (I'm
forcing this one to UTF-8), which does have the
right character:

  330   216   D8     &#216;     LATIN CAPITAL LETTER O WITH STROKE

And it's also correct in the mailing list archive:

  <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2009-October/011545.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2009-October/011545.html</A>

Something evidently mangled it on the way into your mailbox.
