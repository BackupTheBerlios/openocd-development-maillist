&gt;<i> Therefore, when composing a commit message text, it is a good idea to 
</I>&gt;<i> include the following elements:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) A short summary for the patch that is ideally 80 characters or less.
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;Good examples are:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;&quot;Fix incorrect line endings&quot;
</I>
And that one is interesting since it's also an example
of a patch where the summary *suffices* ...


&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;&quot;SVF: fix parsing hex strings containing leading '0' characters&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;&quot;ETM: rename registers, doc tweaks&quot;
</I>
Those two highlight another point:  please tag the patch
according to the subsystem it affects.  That makes log
summaries (the patch-per-line flavor) much more useful.

 
&gt;<i> 2) An empty line. &#160;That's how Git distinguishes the summary line from
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;the main commit explanation text.
</I>
Or ... &quot;git am&quot; will take $SUBJECT as the summary, and add
this blank line automatically.  Which serves a related goal:
when someone sees a commit in the repository, they may want
to see the discussion associated with that patch.

 
&gt;<i> 3) Explanations on the commit. &#160;Here is the place to provide details 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;justifying the change, like a description of the issue, the way this
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;patch is solving it, any remaining issues after that patch is 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;applied, etc. &#160;Of course there are patches that are so trivial to
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;justify any more explanation other than what was already provided in 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;the summary line (the &quot;Fix incorrect line endings&quot; being one 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;such example). &#160;But most patches certainly deserves to be justified
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;with more than one line of text as can be seen from many email 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;threads following their initial posts on the list.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are good examples in the repository already. &#160;So please take some 
</I>&gt;<i> time to look at the output from 'git log' and think about making that 
</I>&gt;<i> log understandable to people other than the patch author by following 
</I>&gt;<i> those good examples.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Also makes &quot;git whatchanged foo.c&quot; be more useful ... you can
then read the history in the file where you isolated the bug,
and then &quot;aha!  this patch probably uncovered/introduced/...
the bug I just ran into!&quot;.  And only *then* look at details.
