Thanx for working on this.

I'll test this imminently. SVF/XSVF has been completely broken since
r1614 when the set of permitted transitions was reduced to be 'more
compliant'. The practical result of this was that any SVF/XSVF file
generated by the Xilinx tools (for our target device at least - Xilinx
coolrunner CPLD) was deemed invalid by openocd. I recently tried using
the python (3.0!) converter which allegedly converts 'illegal' xilinx
xsvf files into kosher xsvf files, but I still found that all I got
was 'illegal transition' errors, just a few lines later than without
that translation.

My understanding of the sordid details is still fuzzy but I
desperately want to move beyond r1614 and can't until SVF/XSVF can be
made to work somewhow. That either needs a way of generating XSVF
files that openocd is happy with, or a way of telling it to accept the
ones it accepted up until r1613 (they work just fine, and come
straight out of Xilinx's tools so I find myself skeptical of the 'this
is not valid and shouldn't be allowed' claim).

More soon.

Wookey
