Are these being updated by hand or by script presently?  It should not
take much to run a cron job that builds the docs and mirrors them, and I
have a server that could do this job for us.

I agree that the split is not ideal, but it looks we had few options.
Arguably, it was already there, and we're just redistributing weight. :)
In the future, the best solution will be a server for our own domain,
though not without more resources.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; So talking in terms of an &quot;RC&quot; model, a week after switching to

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Again, this aligns with my thoughts on our progress, as that should also

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to GIT.  It should be far more useful for others after the re-write too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right.  You'll see I updated small parts of the text, only,
</I>&gt;<i> and left the release.{txt,sh} mostly alone where they were

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For GIT, I think the model is just to tag a release, and then
</I>&gt;<i> branch off that tag if we need bugfix releases (0.3.1 etc).
</I>
Yes, it should be simpler too.  :)  Thankfully.

Cheers,

Zach
