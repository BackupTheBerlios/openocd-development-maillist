</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No, but then I wouldn't expect it to in this case. The xsvf command
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allows the specification of a tap which means that an XSVF file
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nominally created for a single JTAG port still works with chained
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ports (magically - I wasn't expecting openocd to be that clever). The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; svf command doesn't have that option so the svf probably shouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work. I need to re-arrange hardware in order to do the direct
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; side-by-side single-port test and/or generate files for chained-port
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Too bad; but understandable.  That was another reason to
</I>&gt;<i> create XSVF, as I understand:   not just smaller programming
</I>&gt;<i> files, but ones that didn't always need to be rewritten for
</I>&gt;<i> each different scan chain.
</I>
Apparently. I see that SVF specifies a head and tail for the bypassed
devices, whilst XSVF gives the whole bitfield every time. I don't
yet understand why that is functionally different, as it seems to
amount to the same thing. But I am only on page 14 out of 25 :-)
 
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The deal is that until someone (maybe me) writes code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to more or less morph sequences of XSTATE opcodes into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; a pathmove() command, the SVF code can do pathmoves
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; while XSVF can't.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OK. Could you elaborate a bit on why it used to work, but now the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; above is needed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I understand now -- I wasn't paying attention to this
</I>&gt;<i> stuff back when this changed! -- the core issue is that
</I>&gt;<i> the JTAG primitives we used back then got changed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are now basically two primitives for passing through
</I>&gt;<i> the JTAG stage machine:  (a) statemove, which moves from
</I>&gt;<i> one &quot;stable&quot; state to another using a standardized path,
</I>&gt;<i> and (b) pathmove, which does so using a caller-specified
</I>&gt;<i> series of transitions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Previously, I think the &quot;between stable states&quot; constraint
</I>&gt;<i> wasn't consistently enforced.  Ergo rude errors, and the
</I>&gt;<i> change.  The issue with XSVF is that it expects either a
</I>&gt;<i> flavor of (a) or else a third way to move, (c) from one
</I>&gt;<i> state to an adjacent one.  That's sort of what statemove
</I>&gt;<i> used to do, sometimes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thing is, that XSVF adjacent-states motion is used as an
</I>&gt;<i> encoding shorthand for (b)... and I checked the xsvfdump
</I>&gt;<i> output of your XSVF file, so you're not being a rude
</I>&gt;<i> exception to such a rule.  In fact it looks like your file
</I>&gt;<i> is mostly using it for (a) too ... if there's a config
</I>&gt;<i> option not to expand the state transitions like that,
</I>&gt;<i> you might not need this bug fixed yet.
</I>
Hmm, I can look in the webpack but this the 'standard' output so
that's what I'd expect most people to be using. Interesting this is
the exact opposite of what I thought the problem was (the xilinx XSVF
is too detailed about the state transitions - I thought it was too
vague (from openocd's point of view) :-)

&gt;<i> So if I whack together a patch turning XSVF's (c) into
</I>&gt;<i> the (b) which is supported, you could test it and maybe
</I>&gt;<i> fix any goofs?
</I>
Yes, I think so (fighting chance at least).
