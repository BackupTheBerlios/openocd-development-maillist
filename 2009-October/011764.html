Really?  I just looked inside the packages I uploaded, and that is not
what they appear to report.

&gt;<i>  - v0.3.0-rc0-1-gb628207 ... what &quot;git describe&quot; says
</I>
Because the tag is v0.3.0, which is what I thought was our convention
(after v0.2.0).  The 1 is from the version bump that followed the tag.
I suggest adding the 'v' in the openocd.c and openocd.texi files. ;)

&gt;<i>  - 0.3.0-rc1-dev-00001-gb628207-dirty ... from &quot;openocd -v&quot;
</I>
I was confused by this too.  Then, I realized that you must be building
from Git.  Is your working copy clean?   If you build from the tarball,
what does it say? ;)  That's what counts, after all....

&gt;<i> so it's not very consistent.  Tree says rc1 but that's
</I>&gt;<i> not what the tag says...
</I>
I ran the following commands from the top of the current tree:

  git checkout master
  tools/release/version.sh bump rc  # added -rc0  (could add by hand)
  tools/release.sh --next=rc release  # tag and start v0.3.0-rc1-dev

  # gives you on v0.3.0-rc1-dev branch to review, and pkgs in archives/
  git checkout master
  git merge v0.3.0-rc1-dev
  git push sf master

If we want to release -rc1, then it's just:

  tools/release.sh --next=rc release  # tag and start v0.3.0-rc2-dev

If we think we're ready, we could instead release the final v0.3.0 with:

  tools/release.sh --final --next=minor release  # start v0.4.0-dev

If we want to start v0.4.0-rc0-dev instead, then add --start-rc to that.
Both variations are worth trying, as they take slightly different paths.
For example, the script archives NEWS with major/minor releases.

At the moment, the script seems to have performed admirably.  I just ran
a check to confirm this (simulating -rc1), and you should be able to do
that for yourself now.

Cheers,

Zach
