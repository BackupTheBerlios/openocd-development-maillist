Yeah, it doesn't look bad at all.  I am however used
to working with quilt over git.

Now, if I could only find out why nontrivial merges
with git never seem to work right for me.  :(


&gt;<i> &gt; During a bugfix-only RC phase, it'd be natural for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; folk to have ongoing development in branches.  Then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there would be some post-release merges of those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; branches into the mainline.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right.  And to let people have easy access to those branches, my 
</I>&gt;<i> suggestion is for major contributors to publish those branches in the 
</I>&gt;<i> main Git repo on sourceforge.  Suffice to establish a branch namespace 
</I>&gt;<i> such as:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	oyvind/mcrmrc
</I>&gt;<i> 	oyvind/vector_catch
</I>&gt;<i> 	david/thumb2
</I>&gt;<i> 	zach/install_script
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and so on.  Once a branch is ready then someone simply checks out master 
</I>&gt;<i> and merges that branch:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	git checkout master
</I>&gt;<i> 	git merge foobar/perfect_feature
</I>
Or into some staging branch, when multiple branches which
need to cooperate with each other get merged.


&gt;<i> And at that point the branch can be deleted from the main repository.
</I>
That implies a slightly different process than has been followed
thus far ... more of a &quot;long term development activity&quot; than a
&quot;bunch of short term patches&quot;.

Now, I think that such a change would likely be a Good Thing in
many ways.  Bugfixes are the little things; ditto smallish
features.


&gt;<i> And so on.  Unlike CVS, and even SVN to a certain extent, Branches are 
</I>&gt;<i> extremely easy to work with Git and people should not be afraid of using 
</I>&gt;<i> them at will.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Eventually, when OpenOCD will become a project as big as the Linux 
</I>&gt;<i> kernel ;-) then major developers could keep separate Git repositories of 
</I>&gt;<i> their own that get pulled in the main repository.  But for now I think 
</I>&gt;<i> the above suggestion should be good enough and simple.
</I>
Yes.  Zach suggest repositories on non-SF sites for other
developers; same sort of stuff.
