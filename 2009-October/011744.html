I misread David's post.  I didn't realize it has already been pushed.

I am becoming fairly discouraged by the ongoing high-pace use of the
central repository, seeing this type of commit pushed without sufficient
review period.  Are we trying for 0.3.0, or not?!?

&gt;<i> I would like to see:
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> bugfixes as of friday 30. to wed 4.? Cut release nov 5.?
</I>
At present, I do not see what the point is.  We might just as well cut
the current master.  I think the quality will hardly be unchanged, until
we implement better processes.

&gt;<i> - that we can agree that major features are developed in public
</I>&gt;<i> branches on repo.or.cz and then applied to sf when they
</I>&gt;<i> are as ready as they are going to be. Communication can be
</I>&gt;<i> via the mailing list and explicit posts.
</I>
I think that I would rather see us dump SF.net as the primary repository,
switching to a site that does not _require_ central administration for 
clones of the repository.  I continue to be adamant that pushes to the
main tree should be done with machine-like rigor (i.e. scripts only).

&gt;<i> W.r.t. testing I believe that we have to push changes to sf master
</I>&gt;<i> before they are tested beyond the few developers working on
</I>&gt;<i> a particular feature branch.
</I>
That might be true, but the voice of those &quot;few&quot; developers deserve to
be heard before unleashing new patches on the public.

Cheers,

Zach
