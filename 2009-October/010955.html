Yay!

Boo!

I thought that had been solved for some time now.  As I
look at the sourceforge service, I observe that it doesn't
support http access though (except gitweb; not &quot;git pull&quot;).

And since I don't have that unfortunate problem, I'm not
up on the details.  I do know there are various drawbacks
to HTTP access, including slow speed.


&gt;<i> Various recipes circulate the net, but none of them has

</I>&gt;<i> Can Sourceforge be configured for HTTP access, or is the

</I>
For SourceForge, I think it's just HTTP.  Did you look
around much?  I'd hope that would be a FAQ, but ISTR that
last year this time SF didn't offer GIT; so their service
is evolving.  Maybe if we asked, they'd help.  :)


One option would be to tunnel using SSH through the proxy,
something like CorkScrew:

which I found at

 <A HREF="http://github.com/guides/dealing-with-firewalls-and-proxies">http://github.com/guides/dealing-with-firewalls-and-proxies</A>

That also lists a Windows-oriented variant.

Lacking that, we might want a git mirror at a site which
does have easier HTTP access.  We'll have to leave the
important details here up to the folk who will be using
the solutions though...
