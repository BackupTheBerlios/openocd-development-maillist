We need some sort of &quot;generic ARM&quot; core code.

But in this case I think we should start with syntax,
not implementation.  mrc/mcr is more generic, yes,
and cp15 registers are core-specific.

Thing is, implementing access to those isn't quite
generic, as I recall.

And then there's stuff like CM3 which doesn't even
have coprocessor support ... 


&gt;<i> - further mmu handling. I'm not quite sure what to expose and
</I>&gt;<i> how here.
</I>
I suspect we'll know we're done with this when we can handle
two distinct scenarios cleanly:

 - Linux kernel debugging, which runs with MMU active and
   basically uses a fixed MMU context;

 - Linux userspace debugging (via GDB!), which also runs
   with MMU active but where the MMU context changes.

So for example, we'd want to have a breakpoint apply when
one particular task is active ... but not when a different
task's MMU context is in use.

 
&gt;<i> Recently made more general:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - virtual to physical address translation
</I>&gt;<i> - physical memory read/write
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Yeah, that seemed like the right direction.
