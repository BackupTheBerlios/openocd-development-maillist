<PRE>As noted recently by Alex, we're carrying around significant
quantities of unwanted cruft in the git repository.  If you
have a current clone, you can see it by:

	git whatchanged -- zy1000

That's around 100 MBytes of useless stuff that gets pulled,
and then carried around in repositories.  We want to get rid
of that before 0.3.x releases go out.  (Also a few other noise
commits.)

This is a one-time fix, addressing some SVN conversion issues;
such changes should not happen again.  Since we only recently
switched over to use git, we don't expect many folk to have
significant branches yet; such branches would be disturbed by
this switchover.


So here's my rough plan on how to fix:

 - At time T, I rename the &quot;openocd&quot; repository to &quot;openocd-old&quot;.
   You'll be able to tell &quot;T&quot; since &quot;git pull&quot; (or clone) using
   the previous <A HREF="git://">git://</A> URL won't work.  The &quot;openocd-old&quot; repo
   will be a temporary backup, which we expect will vanish by
   the end of November.  It may help if you need to rebase some
   branch.

 - At time T+1, I provide a new &quot;openocd&quot; repository which is
   equivalent to &quot;openocd-old&quot; ... but is rebased to purge those
   useless commits, and their data.  Commit IDs before about a
   year ago will be unchanged.  All newer ones will be different,
   because they won't have have those useless commits in their
   ancestry.  (I'll use the &quot;grafts&quot; file I previously posted.)

 - From time T+2 and later, everyone will want to get new clones
   of that repository.  I'll send out an email announcing this,
   presumably as a followup on this thread.

And I'm proposing that &quot;time T&quot; be about 11pm PST (a bit over
twelve hours from when I write this).  Committers, please plan
to be idle for a few hours on either side of that, just to make
this conversion easier on me.  :)

Comments?

I've not done one of these transitions before, so I'm not quite
clear on what could trip anyone up if they don't re-clone.  But
I know that re-cloning is safe, and will be a lot cheaper than
the original bloated clones were.  :)

- Dave
