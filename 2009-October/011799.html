Bizarre.  Disabling those let the initial enumeration
work at full speed??  Or was that caused by some other
patches in your repository?

Is this still with adaptive clocking enabled?

Where did those strange 16-bit values come from,
which were breaking the JTAG scans?


&gt;<i> Otherwise my setup hasn't changed: 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Openocd fetched from latest GIT
</I>&gt;<i> 2. libftdi-0.16 from the latest release tarball
</I>
Good...


&gt;<i> 3. FT2232 timeout/retry-count patch applied (attached).
</I>
Still trying to understand details here.  This
was not needed at full speed, just high speed?

Looks like this should be safe to apply, but I
need to see a decent patch description.  And if
the so-called &quot;timeout&quot; isn't really a timeout,
it'd be good to at least see that issue commented
in the code ... if not eventually fixed, switching
it to a real timeout scheme.


&gt;<i> 4. ARM-USB-TINY-H interface config (attached)
</I>
I'll merge that interface config patch; but I
fixed the URL in that file.  Didn't fix the one
for the highspeed non-tiny product, which you're
not quite pre-announcing here.  :)


&gt;<i> After starting openocd I issue the following commands (see attached log):
</I>&gt;<i> 1. reset init
</I>&gt;<i> 2. arm7_9 dcc_downloads disable
</I>&gt;<i> 3. load_image dd 0x20000000        #THIS WORKS
</I>&gt;<i> 4. arm7_9 dcc_downloads enable
</I>&gt;<i> 5. load_image dd 0x20000000        #THIS FAILS.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After that the FT2232H is not usable until it is power cycled.
</I>
Hmm.  I see two problems:

 - Not usable till power cycled ... can you establish
   whether this is a hardware bug of some kind?  In Linux
   you should be able to force a medium-weight reset of
   the device by writing the bConfiguration sysfs value
   for that device to zero (then back to what it was).

   Being able to trigger that failure seems clearly to
   be some kind of bug on our side.  Not being able to
   recover from it could be our bug; but maybe not.

 - The DCC download feature thing.  The issue shouldn't
   be the DCC per se ... but the &quot;fast&quot; optimization
   that disables handshaking.  If you're running the
   JTAG clock six times faster, and the code inside
   the ARM isn't running out of icache or TCM, then you
   might not be able to avoid the handshaking...

Can you sort out that DCC thing a bit better, to verify
that it works OK with handshaking enabled?

 
&gt;<i> With regards to the additional GIT revisions, I cloned a
</I>&gt;<i> fresh OpenOCD copy and applied my patches on top just to
</I>&gt;<i> be sure this is not the problem.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As for ftd2xx, libftdi now works for me so I won't have 
</I>&gt;<i> to mess up with closed source libraries :) 
</I>
That's the idea!  Of course, MS-Windows is another mess.  :(


&gt;<i> As user I see the following two problems:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. DCC downloads do not work, although they are marked as default for SAM9-L9260.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. USB communication failures freeze the dongle until it is power cycled.
</I>
Yes, those are problems.  See above.
