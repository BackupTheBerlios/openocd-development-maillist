I was a quilt user before Git.  These days however I do all my stuff 
with native Git branches only.  I looked at StGit at some point and came 
back to native Git.  When you get used to it, you don't want to look 
back.

Creating a new branch is easy:

	git branch new_branch_name

And then:

	git checkout new_branch_name

You can add new commits as usual.  Then if you want to do the equivalent 
of &quot;quilt pop -a; (update repo); quilt push -a&quot; then you can do that and 
much more with &quot;git fetch; git rebase ...&quot;.  The --interactive mode to 
'git rebase' is incredibly useful.  No need for quilt nor stgit anymore 
at that point (IMHO of course).

Right.  And to let people have easy access to those branches, my 
suggestion is for major contributors to publish those branches in the 
main Git repo on sourceforge.  Suffice to establish a branch namespace 
such as:

	oyvind/mcrmrc
	oyvind/vector_catch
	david/thumb2
	zach/install_script

and so on.  Once a branch is ready then someone simply checks out master 
and merges that branch:

	git checkout master
	git merge foobar/perfect_feature

And at that point the branch can be deleted from the main repository.

And so on.  Unlike CVS, and even SVN to a certain extent, Branches are 
extremely easy to work with Git and people should not be afraid of using 
them at will.

Eventually, when OpenOCD will become a project as big as the Linux 
kernel ;-) then major developers could keep separate Git repositories of 
their own that get pulled in the main repository.  But for now I think 
the above suggestion should be good enough and simple.
