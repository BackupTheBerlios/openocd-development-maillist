</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   - Disable write access to the SVN repository on BerliOS.

</I>
Actually &#216;yvind has suggested doing that today ... &quot;by Oct 8&quot;, if
you will.  Call it 8-Oct-2009 Zulu time ... 5pm PST.  :)

Key maintainers already have write access to the GIT tree, so that
part is a &quot;go&quot; already.  (Other active maintainers can get access
just by asking, of course.)  And that tree has been in fairly close
synch with SVN all along.


&gt;<i>   - Update official GIT-over-HTTP mirror(s) of the SF repository.
</I>
When we have such a mirror!  Someone should contact SF to see
if they have a strong reason for not offering HTTP access.

And meanwhile, folk needing HTTP access can download snapshots
using the gitweb interface at SF.  I did one yesterday, it was
about 1.3MBytes (compressed TAR).


&gt;<i>   - Update all documentation to reference the SF.net site and mirror(s).
</I>
I've got a patch to do most of that.  How about this process:

 - At time Z, commit a patch to SVN to make builds emit
   a warning &quot;current repository is &lt;URL&gt;&quot; ... so that
   the archival SVN history isn't trashed.

 - Also at time Z, and after syncing to the version right
   before that &quot;disable&quot; patch, commit a patch to GIT which
   makes the GIT tree reference GIT not SVN.

 - At time Z+1, both patches are upstream.  Now it's safe
   to make the SVN repository read-only.

 - Beginning at time Z+2, nobody uses SVN any more.  Send
   an email to the list finalizing that switch.

I can handle the two commits, but can't make SVN read-only.
Zach, will you take care of that, and sending the announce?

Where &quot;Z&quot; is about 5pm PST today, and values of &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;
are convenient for whoever handles those last two points.  :)


&gt;<i>   - Copy all existing File Releases to SF.net.
</I>&gt;<i>   - Update project summary information on both sites.
</I>&gt;<i>   - Post an announcement that describe the changes.
</I>
Yes.  Copying the file releases can be done at any time,
as can most of the project summary info updates.  IMO, do
them soon after finishing the GIT switch.


&gt;<i> The GIT mirror details seem to require further research, but this plan
</I>&gt;<i> seems like it will move the community forward.  After this first phase,
</I>&gt;<i> we get into slightly-less-pressing infrastructure changes, which require
</I>&gt;<i> an indeterminate amount of debate or work before being ready for action:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   - Debate: Migrate to another mailing list provider.  Which one?
</I>&gt;<i>   - Debate: Should we create a new version-controlled website?  How?
</I>&gt;<i>   - Docs: Migrate website content into repository (retire WordPress).
</I>&gt;<i>   - Scripting: Tag 0.3.0 in GIT and release it to SF.net and BerliOS.
</I>
After the switch to GIT there's not a whole lot of stuff on my
personal list of &quot;0.3.x must have&quot;.  There will be URLs to change
as soon as we de-emphasize the Berlios web facilities, which may
need to be part of the 0.3.x cycle.

So talking in terms of an &quot;RC&quot; model, a week after switching to
the GIT repository seems like the a good time to want &quot;RC1&quot;...
