I do too. Long tradition of patch contributions to some other Open 
Source projects.  See for example one of my best here:

	<A HREF="http://git.kernel.org/?p=git/git.git;a=commit;h=0e8189e270">http://git.kernel.org/?p=git/git.git;a=commit;h=0e8189e270</A>

While the above is quite an extreme example, I still do think that patch 
contributors to OpenOCD should be a bit more verbose in their commit 
messages.  Without naming anyone, some commits have extremely light 
messages which are rather useless without actually looking at the patch 
directly.  And I know that those unamed individuals have good writing 
skills given their track records on this mailing list.  I hope those 
people know who they are and will consider this as a gentle request to 
improve their patch logs.

Now... People might be unaware of the fact that Git interprets the first 
line of a commit message a bit specially.  It is used by tools such as 
shortlog or format-patch to provide a subject line or a short summary.

Therefore, when composing a commit message text, it is a good idea to 
include the following elements:

1) A short summary for the patch that is ideally 80 characters or less.
   Good examples are:

   &quot;Fix incorrect line endings&quot;

   &quot;SVF: fix parsing hex strings containing leading '0' characters&quot;

   &quot;ETM: rename registers, doc tweaks&quot;

2) An empty line.  That's how Git distinguishes the summary line from
   the main commit explanation text.

3) Explanations on the commit.  Here is the place to provide details 
   justifying the change, like a description of the issue, the way this
   patch is solving it, any remaining issues after that patch is 
   applied, etc.  Of course there are patches that are so trivial to
   justify any more explanation other than what was already provided in 
   the summary line (the &quot;Fix incorrect line endings&quot; being one 
   such example).  But most patches certainly deserves to be justified
   with more than one line of text as can be seen from many email 
   threads following their initial posts on the list.

There are good examples in the repository already.  So please take some 
time to look at the output from 'git log' and think about making that 
log understandable to people other than the patch author by following 
those good examples.
