<PRE>btw, the mrc/mcr work was just a natural followup on
the work I did on physical memory read/write.

It's something that's supported very differently across lots
of targets today, but really should be handled in the same
manner.

Generally yes, but take a careful look at xscale and arm966e
specifically. They can both support mcr/mrc, but it is unrealistic
to try to do this in a single patch. The job is too big, it would
never have been done that way, certainly I would be unable
to attempt it.

I *did* complete all the cases that could be relatively easily
done with the latest round of patches, so I claim to have lived up
to your requirement above.

&gt;<i> I am striving to gain a better perspective of the system at this level, but
</I>&gt;<i> it seems that your present implementation weakens OpenOCD's
</I>&gt;<i> architecture and thus creates a new barrier to improving it.
</I>
Could you be more specific w.r.t. mrc/mcr?

As soon as each of the implementations of mrc/mcr can be tested,
we can retire the special commands for that target. This means
that knowledge for one target will be reusable on another,
reducing barriers to improving it. The mrc/mcr shows that the
targets really are a lot more similar than the copy &amp; modified
code would have us believe...

&gt;<i> Obviously, I am not trying to discourage you from continuing to work on
</I>&gt;<i> these features, but this should underscore the notion that only complete
</I>&gt;<i> and reviewed work should be pushed.
</I>
I agree with this principle and I agree that I was too quick with mcr/mrc.

However, to me it was it was a natural extension of the physical memory
read/write  polymorphism work and didn't occur to me as very controversial.
Especially in light of the positive reception that the physical memory
read/write got.

With the latest patches I believe that I've found a &quot;local optimium&quot;
where it is time to commit and find some other time where e.g. XScale
and arm966e can be attacked. XScale and arm966e require significant
insight into the target and preferably access to target hardware.

Note that the mrc/mcr does not change any of the existing code or
commands, so while it's &quot;noise&quot; until the old code can be retired,
the chance of regressions are minimal.

&gt;<i> Please publish a mirror on repo.or.cz and push this branch regularly so
</I>&gt;<i> others can pull it for testing.
</I>
I find it hard to believe that anyone would step up and do the
testing that way. There is very little evidence to the effect.

A more realistic testing plan would be to wait until 0.3 is out of
the door and then switch over e.g. arm926ejs to retire the
cp15 specific commands.

&gt;&gt;<i> This whole mrc/mcr thing is about driving
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OpenOCD in the direction of polymorphic interfaces
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at the C and command level, ref recent &quot;mww phys&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is this the right level though? &#160;Anything that is specific to ARM should
</I>&gt;<i> not be in target.[ch].
</I>
If the current programming model supported the concepts
of interfaces, then this would have gone into some arm
generic files.

We have a separate problem(which I won't try to attempt solving
anytime soon) in that we have a very weak
model(not any really) to define an interface which a target
can either support or not. I wasn't trying to address this problem
here, but I wrote the code to be trivially converted to any
such scheme that is worth it's salt.

Such interface is stuff is trivial in C++/java, but I haven't
seen it done elegantly in C yet. I hear it can be done
and certainly well enough for OpenOCD's simple needs.

I had a crack at interface stuff when I made the arm
instruction simulator work w/arm11 to implement
single stepping when there was no hardware support
for single stepping, perhaps that would have been a way
to go? (combined with some method in target to query
for an interface pointer by ID?)
