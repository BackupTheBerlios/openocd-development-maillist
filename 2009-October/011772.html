Well, my part in that was much easier than I expected, and you sir,
are a genius :-)

It took me a day to work out how to get git to do the equivalent of
'svn up' (because my balloon3.cfg file conflicted and I got a lot of
whinging about 'uncompleted merges' which took some grokking to deal
with), but once I was uptodate and tried your patch it 'just worked'. 

No XSVF 'don't like your transitions' whinges, and a brand new fresh
board programs OK and reads NAND afterwards so the CPLD is correctly
programmed.

So I suggest you check that in and we look forward to using v0.3.0 for
real work :-)

I'll try the svf stuff too, but not today.

Cheers very much for that. Now to see if the 'only works on amd64' and
'only works every other time' bugs from r1613 have gone in latest :-)

One odd thing is that the behaviour of jtag_reset seems to have changed.

 jtag_reset 0 1 
used to reset the board. Now it puts it into reset and
leaves it there. I need:
 jtag_reset 0 1
 jtag_reset 0 0 
to actually reset. Is that expected?
