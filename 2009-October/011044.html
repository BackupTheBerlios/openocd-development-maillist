<PRE>Hi all,

I have tried to summarize the recent infrastructure threads topics into
short lists for the community to read, repose, and ratify (or reject).
I have waited to jump in to give the community time to contribute input,
and there have been many constructive ideas offered to move us forward.
These plans try to wrap these threads into some concrete steps to take,
though I expect it will also cause more discussion.

BerliOS:
- ... has served OpenOCD well, but they are a single point of failure.
- The recent outage forced the maintainers to consider better services.
- When the SVN repository is offline, developers cannot do many tasks.
- Thus, we want to make the change from SVN to GIT.
- Switching to SF.net will give better uptime, mirroring, and web UI.
- We could mirror static content on both sites (e.g. files, docs, etc.).

Migration Priorities:
- Reliability: we should stand to improve availability of services
- GIT hosting: some firewalls need to use a <A HREF="http://">http://</A> mirror (not <A HREF="git://">git://</A>)
- Mailing Lists: good web archives, no ads, works w/ gmane

SourceForge:
- David Brownell setup the SourceForge project for a GIT mirror.
- Active project maintainers are signed up and authorized there.
- The mailing list ads and web archives are unappealing to some.
- No GIT service over <A HREF="http://">http://</A> (serves <A HREF="git://">git://</A> URLs only).
- Acceptable, if we provide a HTTP GIT mirror and ad-free mailing list?

Other hosting providers:
- See Wikipedia for a comparison:
  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open_source_software_hosting_facilities">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open_source_software_hosting_facilities</A>
- GNU Savannah: may require us to change our name to &quot;FreeOCD&quot;?!? :D
- SF.net seems to be the winner: it has the most users for good reasons.

Mailing List Provider Options:
- SF.net: adds ads to list mail; ugly web archive UI
- Google or Yahoo Groups: &quot;modern&quot; custom web UI
- vger.kernel.org: majordomo, thus no web UI
- or don't change: keep using BerliOS for e-mail (acceptable for now?)

GIT Hosting Provider Options (who can serve <A HREF="http://">http://</A> URLs):
- <A HREF="http://github.com/:">http://github.com/:</A> up to 300MB free... our repo is 100MB presently.
- <A HREF="http://gitorious.org/:">http://gitorious.org/:</A> 
- <A HREF="http://repo.or.cz/:">http://repo.or.cz/:</A> 


Migration of content should be made gradually and methodically.  At this
point, the maintainers seem to have agreed that SF.net offers sufficient
advantage to use it for hosting our GIT repository, file distribution,
and various other services.

I think we have a plan to begin migrating and expanding the services.
Specifically, we seem to agree upon the following actions to be done
on Thu, Oct 8, 2009:

  - Disable write access to the SVN repository on BerliOS.
  - Sync GIT tree on SF.net final time, then open it for write access.
  - Update official GIT-over-HTTP mirror(s) of the SF repository.
  - Update all documentation to reference the SF.net site and mirror(s).
  - Copy all existing File Releases to SF.net.
  - Update project summary information on both sites.
  - Post an announcement that describe the changes.

The GIT mirror details seem to require further research, but this plan
seems like it will move the community forward.  After this first phase,
we get into slightly-less-pressing infrastructure changes, which require
an indeterminate amount of debate or work before being ready for action:

  - Debate: Migrate to another mailing list provider.  Which one?
  - Debate: Should we create a new version-controlled website?  How?
  - Docs: Migrate website content into repository (retire WordPress).
  - Scripting: Tag 0.3.0 in GIT and release it to SF.net and BerliOS.

I hope this information has been useful and can help us move forward
together with focused determination.  If there are other issues that you
believe deserve to be addressed, please feel free to list them.

Cheers,

Zach Welch
