Too bad; but understandable.  That was another reason to
create XSVF, as I understand:   not just smaller programming
files, but ones that didn't always need to be rewritten for
each different scan chain.


&gt;<i> &gt; The deal is that until someone (maybe me) writes code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to more or less morph sequences of XSTATE opcodes into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a pathmove() command, the SVF code can do pathmoves
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; while XSVF can't.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK. Could you elaborate a bit on why it used to work, but now the
</I>&gt;<i> above is needed.

As I understand now -- I wasn't paying attention to this
stuff back when this changed! -- the core issue is that
the JTAG primitives we used back then got changed.

There are now basically two primitives for passing through
the JTAG stage machine:  (a) statemove, which moves from
one &quot;stable&quot; state to another using a standardized path,
and (b) pathmove, which does so using a caller-specified
series of transitions.

Previously, I think the &quot;between stable states&quot; constraint
wasn't consistently enforced.  Ergo rude errors, and the
change.  The issue with XSVF is that it expects either a
flavor of (a) or else a third way to move, (c) from one
state to an adjacent one.  That's sort of what statemove
used to do, sometimes.

Thing is, that XSVF adjacent-states motion is used as an
encoding shorthand for (b)... and I checked the xsvfdump
output of your XSVF file, so you're not being a rude
exception to such a rule.  In fact it looks like your file
is mostly using it for (a) too ... if there's a config
option not to expand the state transitions like that,
you might not need this bug fixed yet.


&gt;<i> I've just spent half the day reading the xilinx 
</I>&gt;<i> svf/xsvf spec so I am getting some idea of what's going on. I may be
</I>&gt;<i> in a position to do some more intelligent debugging soon.
</I>
So if I whack together a patch turning XSVF's (c) into
the (b) which is supported, you could test it and maybe
fix any goofs?
