I wouldn't go that far ... but feel free to feed the ego.  ;)

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No XSVF 'don't like your transitions' whinges, and a brand new fresh

</I>
Yay!!!


&gt;<i> So I suggest you check that in and we look forward to using v0.3.0 for
</I>&gt;<i> real work :-)
</I>
That was the idea.  Active user who reports bugs and tries to
make this thing work?  Bug that's by now fairly well understood?
Let's see if we can make this problem vanish before releasing...

I'll credit you with a &quot;tested-by&quot; on this one.

 
&gt;<i> I'll try the svf stuff too, but not today.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers very much for that. Now to see if the 'only works on amd64' and
</I>&gt;<i> 'only works every other time' bugs from r1613 have gone in latest :-)
</I>
I was curious about that.  Could that XScale stackframe
corruption bugfix have been the issue?

 
&gt;<i> One odd thing is that the behaviour of jtag_reset seems to have changed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;jtag_reset 0 1 
</I>&gt;<i> used to reset the board. Now it puts it into reset and
</I>&gt;<i> leaves it there. I need:
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;jtag_reset 0 1
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;jtag_reset 0 0 
</I>&gt;<i> to actually reset. Is that expected?
</I>
Yes.  Sometimes you need to issue JTAG commands while
SRST is being held high.  You'd do that between the
two commands that you now use.
