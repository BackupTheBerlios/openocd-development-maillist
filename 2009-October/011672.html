So here you're really saying that development branches aren't
really used, except as a way for maintainers to track patch series?

There will be a dozen patches to the mrcmcr stuff before
it's &quot;all over&quot; and ready to be committed.

What could I realistically expect in terms of testing for the below?

- a patch series a dozen patches long
- a branch on sf
- branch on that other web site in some repository
- a branch on that other web site in the &quot;testing&quot; branch of
the official testing repository
- committed to master branch
- some scheme whereby all development branches on all
repositories are automatically merged into the &quot;daily pile&quot; that
users can test...

?

I don't worry about development &amp; branching, git has that
sorted.

My greatest fear is that we come up with some sort
of fancy scheme that gives *zero* testing before stuff is
finally committed to the mater branch, which is back
to square one really...

If there was a simple and obvious answer to this problem of
testing and branched development, then we wouldn't be having
this discussion.

I feel that OpenOCD is special in that for it's size(code and
community) it has an insane number of different targets and
a huge distance between developers and test hardware.
