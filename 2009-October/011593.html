Thanks! I've downloaded the non-comercial .EXE and will give it a go  
whenever I get round to booting Windows :-)

Oh indeed :-) The list of stupidities is frightening :-)
My favourite short one is

0000003C	SUB, R0, R0, #1
00000040	MOV R1, #0
00000044	CMP R0, R1
00000048	BNE	0x30
0000004C	B      0x50
00000050	...

OK. I suppose what I'm doing at the moment, ie. looking at the STR9- 
comstick flash, WITHOUT having the source code, isn't that usual a task.

I had a look at the objdump output (-D -b binary -m arm) and its  
markup seems to be limited to calculating PC relative addresses for  
you. The dumped flash file doesn't seem to have a symbol table, as far  
as I can tell.

I wasn't proposing that.

... but not very advanced disassembly :-)

OK.

Thanks for the responses. I'm now clued up and happy :-)

My 150 line disassembler produces more useful output than the GNU one,  
so it wasn't a total waste of time.

But it won't be anything like as good as IDA Pro.

Also, no one has said &quot;why aren't you using the free ARM products you  
dunce!&quot; so I don't need to go hunting for The Sensible solution. :-)
