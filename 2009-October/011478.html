</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
&quot;Potentially data&quot; ... actually, the arch spec talks
about &quot;potentially code&quot;, and you asked to treat it
as code; so &quot;undefined opcode&quot; is more consistent.


&gt;<i> &gt; Better approach:  treat them all as undefined opcodes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's more correct, in any case...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Whether they are labelled as undefined opcodes or data doesn't bother  
</I>&gt;<i> me.
</I>
I'd go for &quot;undefined opcode&quot;.

 
&gt;<i> &gt; If you could provide a fix in the format &quot;git diff&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; produces, such a change could be applied as a patch
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using &quot;patch -p1 &lt; yourstuff&quot; and then merged.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK, I'll go and learn git, sometime. *grumble, grumble*
</I>
You don't really have to do that, but the relevant bits
are *really* easy:

	git clone ...
	bootstrap
	configure --enable-maintainer-mode ...
	build ... yay, it works!
	change some code
	build, test, verify
	git diff &gt; my.patch

 
&gt;<i> &gt; Note that you should generate such a patch against
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the latest code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK, but don't you have the stable v. bleeding edge thing? I downloaded
</I>&gt;<i> openocd-0.2.0 since it was supposed to be the latest stable release. (?)
</I>
Our policy is to accept patches against reasonobly current
code ... we're *very* near a 0.3  release now.

 
&gt;<i> &gt; You can download a snapshot from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the gitweb interface, if you like.  In any case,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like 1318 doesn't look *anything* like that in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; current code, so I have no idea which of the many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stupid &quot;should not reach this point&quot; messages you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ran into ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I only got ONE &quot;should not reach this point&quot; &#8212; because it stopped
</I>&gt;<i> disassembling there :-)
</I>
Yes, they're all equally stupid.  I'd hate to fix just
one, and find it's not the one you ran into!  ;)

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PS. I can't consider myself an OpenOCD developer yet - I'm still  
</I>&gt;<i> learning.
</I>
Learning never ends.  If that's your criterion, you
will never reach &quot;yet&quot;!


&gt;<i> I'm also going through the code which was in the Hitex STR9-comstick.
</I>&gt;<i> The raw disassembler output isn't ideal, ie. what I would have  
</I>&gt;<i> written, so
</I>&gt;<i> it's taking a while...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Bit pointless really though, since *my* beagle_board has just  
</I>&gt;<i> arrived :-)
</I>
Well, if you're using a Beagle there will probably be a few
other things you can learn.  And maybe even find ways to
submit a few not-yet-developer patches, if you want.  :)
