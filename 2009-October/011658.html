Google may be your friend, but your *best* friend is still grep :-)

So I hope you read the README when compiling openOCD - there's some  
Amontec specific stuff there.

Then the docs say that ideally you want to use a config file that  
someone has already written.

Your friendly grep will tell you that the sneakily named tcl/interface/ 
chameleon.cfg, jtagkey-tiny.cfg and jtagkey.cfg have Amontec-specific  
stuff. I hope one of them works for you.

Then you need a .cfg for your board and possibly the target chip. I  
found tcl/target/samsung_s3c2440.cfg and samsung_s3c6410 AND  
smdk6410.cfg for Samsung chips. I don't know f they're close enough.

Want 2410. Have 2440 and 6410. Hmmm. Perhaps take the first half of  
the 24.40 file and the second half of one of the 64.10 files?  :-)

I don't know what a GPS replacement board is, but some of the boards  
have Samsung flash. E.g.

tcl/board/unknown-board-atmel-at91sam9260.cfg:	#mww 0xffffea08  
0x85227259         # SDRAMC_CR : Configure SDRAM (2 x Samsung  
K4S561632H-UC75 : 4M x 16Bit x 4 Banks)

If you need to create your own board .cfg file, they might be good to  
start looking.


In the end, you want your openocd.cfg to look something like

source [find interface/jtagkey.cfg]
source [find board/my_gps_board.cfg]
source [find target/samsung_s3c2410.cfg]

(if you put your created board and target .cfg files with wherever the  
others were installed.)

Then, if openocd starts up OK (as a server) you can telnet to it using:

telnet localhost 4444

That gives you an OpenOCD prompt, at which you type:

help

Then you can inspect memory and dump_image and load stuff into etc.


I hope that's some help - but I'm not an expert so caveat emptor, or  
cave canem or something.
