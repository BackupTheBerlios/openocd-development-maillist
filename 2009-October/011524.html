Maybe you guys should just try to start using Git branches for real?

I think that would have made perfect sense to fork a mcrmrc branch from 
master, put that stuff in there, even publish that branch to 
sourceforge.  And similarly for any other RFC or anything that isn't a 
totally trivial change.

Then this could be reviewed at ease, and anyone could even merge it into 
their owl local master (or any other test) branch for testing.

Then, if there is consensus about the mcrmrc branch amongst the primary 
maintainers, it is rather trivial to merge it back into master and 
delete the mcrmrc branch from sourceforge.

Since a switch to Git has been made, you should really start exploiting 
its best features (such as branches) and stop thinking like a SVN user.
