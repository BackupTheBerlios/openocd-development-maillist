Some comments:

I prefer read_cp/write_cp to mrc/mcr, since we really want to read/write 
to the coprocessor registers. The fact that this is implemented using 
the mrc/mcr instructions is not important here. There are no other arm 
instructions treated like that, rather we specifiy the registers, memory 
etc. that we want to access.

It is definitely possible that there might be a future coprocessor 
access debug component that accesses coprocessors using a coresight 
memory mapped interface. This is pure speculation but is intended to 
show why read_cp/write_cp better reflects the intended function of this 
interface.

The natural place for this would IHMO be armv4_5, this will include 
Armv7A targets but not Armv7M targets.

Best regards,
Magnus
