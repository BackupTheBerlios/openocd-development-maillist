Well, it should do something other than dying, or silently ignoring  
it :-)

Generally I trust (ARM) assemblers to output correct code. On this  
assumption
garbage, ie. anything unrecognized, is _potentially_ data. The LOG_ERROR
I replaced was the last catch-all case in the arm_evaluate_opcode  
procedure.

There were two others so I guess they should be replaced too.

&gt;<i> Better approach:  treat them all as undefined opcodes.
</I>&gt;<i> That's more correct, in any case...
</I>
Whether they are labelled as undefined opcodes or data doesn't bother  
me.

&gt;<i> If you could provide a fix in the format &quot;git diff&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> produces, such a change could be applied as a patch
</I>&gt;<i> using &quot;patch -p1 &lt; yourstuff&quot; and then merged.
</I>
OK, I'll go and learn git, sometime. *grumble, grumble*

&gt;<i> Note that you should generate such a patch against
</I>&gt;<i> the latest code.
</I>
OK, but don't you have the stable v. bleeding edge thing? I downloaded
openocd-0.2.0 since it was supposed to be the latest stable release. (?)

&gt;<i> You can download a snapshot from
</I>&gt;<i> the gitweb interface, if you like.  In any case,
</I>&gt;<i> like 1318 doesn't look *anything* like that in the
</I>&gt;<i> current code, so I have no idea which of the many
</I>&gt;<i> stupid &quot;should not reach this point&quot; messages you
</I>&gt;<i> ran into ...
</I>
Well, I only got ONE &quot;should not reach this point&quot; &#8212; because it stopped
disassembling there :-)

PS. I can't consider myself an OpenOCD developer yet - I'm still  
learning.
I'm also going through the code which was in the Hitex STR9-comstick.
The raw disassembler output isn't ideal, ie. what I would have  
written, so
it's taking a while...

Bit pointless really though, since *my* beagle_board has just  
arrived :-)
