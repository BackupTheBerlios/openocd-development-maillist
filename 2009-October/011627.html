The series is complete at this point. What's lacking are
other non-related issues to be solved. Meanwhile the code could
be tested on hardware and old code could be retired.

Once various other issues have been solved, then
the code could take advantage of that.

The re-testing phase of the mrc/mcr fn's in targets will
take longer, and is not affected by, the interface fixes that
will allow mrc/mcr to be moved.

W.r.t. the release, then the danger is not of regression, but
that undocumented commands, that probably work could
be discovered by users. Alternatively it could be that we're
committing completely new stuff, but I think as long as
the &quot;stuff&quot; has very little chance of regression, then keeping
all the code synced up as much as possible(wonderful
as git is) has value.
