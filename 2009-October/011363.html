In what respect(s) ... what tasks do you find awkward today that
a *Graphical* UI would help with?

I think there's likely improvement to be made by noticing ways
that, for example, an Eclipse-plus-OpenOCD toolchain loses by
comparison to various other JTAG toolchains, and filling in gaps.


&gt;<i> I've seen this 
</I>&gt;<i> project: <A HREF="http://openocd-gui.sourceforge.net/,">http://openocd-gui.sourceforge.net/,</A> but I'm not entirely certain
</I>&gt;<i> if I like their direction.
</I>
Or whether they *have* a direction for that matter!  :(
I saw a bunch of posts re the 0.1.x code, then nothing.

Their website seems to have gotten all the attention.  It's
fairly zippy, but rather noisy for my taste.


&gt;<i> What I wanted to find out from the OpenOCD community is the interest in this
</I>&gt;<i> and if there is any preference on how the frontend would be put together.
</I>&gt;<i> Right now I'm thinking of making it an Eclipse plug-in or
</I>
How would you see the role of an &quot;OpenOCD GUI&quot; be distinct from
just supporting a GUI environment like Eclipse?

I think that &quot;fit well into Eclipse's GUI&quot; would likely be achievable,
which is an important thing to have in goals.  &quot;Have a good GUI&quot; is
not a very well-formed notion today..

An Eclipse plug-in would be nice if it came with instructions about
how to properly introduce Eclipse to one of my JTAG-enabled targets.
How to set things up, to compile, run and step a  &quot;blinkenlights&quot;
project is a bit opaque today, though I *think* a lot of it should
just be &quot;fill in the docs&quot;.


&gt;<i> creating a 
</I>&gt;<i> separate JAR built using Java Swing or SWT.  I'm sort of avoiding the use of
</I>&gt;<i> C++, C, TCL/Tk, Python, or Perl/Tk mainly because everyone should have some
</I>&gt;<i> form of Java interpreter that has support for Swing and Java is very easy to
</I>&gt;<i> work in.
</I>
Toolkit is IMO of less relevance than what it does, and whether
there are enough developers.  Eclipse has one or two developers
in its community (or so I'm told).

Toolkit _integration_ will often shake loose design glitches though.

 
&gt;<i> Another thing of interest is a feature list.  I've started a feature list in
</I>&gt;<i> this email and additions are welcome.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. OpenOCD server configuration
</I>&gt;<i>     a. Telnet Port
</I>&gt;<i>     b. GDB Port
</I>&gt;<i>     c. TCL Port
</I>&gt;<i>     d. Target Type
</I>&gt;<i>     e. Interface
</I>
Well, &quot;board&quot; type too.  And there can be custom config
issues, and interactions ... using interface X means you
don't have access to signals Y or Z; board may have this
set of config jumpers set up in this way; etc.


&gt;<i> 2. Start and stop OpenOCD with log output to window
</I>&gt;<i>     a. Colored output for errors, info, etc.
</I>
And get rid of most of that spewage, for that matter!
Almost none of it should exist.  If I enter commands
to a Tcl prompt, the results shouldn't be echoed in
two places ...
 

&gt;<i> 3. Connect to OpenOCD to issue commands
</I>&gt;<i>     a. Perhaps a list of available commands filtered based on target and
</I>&gt;<i> interface
</I>&gt;<i>     b. Target status display
</I>&gt;<i>     c. Multiple windows for multiple targets/interfaces
</I>
Some target status display sounds nice.  Multi-target configs
would likely shake loose problems ... I know of a few already.

(Ways to debug multi-target may vary a bit.  I'd expect a
dual-core OMAP4 to need an SMP-ish model, but a board that's
got two Cortex-M3 chips will be asymmetric and may want very
different models.)


&gt;<i> 4. Target flashing/loading of programs
</I>
For example, a board vendor (or third party) should be able
to say &quot;here's now to reinstall everything&quot; using OpenOCD.

And shouldn't such a board vendor be able to provide scripts
that add &quot;flash this firmware&quot; options to the Eclipse menu?


&gt;<i> This is just a start for the list of features and mirrors some ideas from
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD-GUI.  I'm sure I'll think of more and I'm sure the people on this
</I>&gt;<i> list know things that I've missed.  In a week or two I'll put together some
</I>&gt;<i> design documentation based on suggestions and resubmit to this list for any
</I>&gt;<i> revisions or opinions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On another note, this leads me to wonder if there is a possibility of an API
</I>&gt;<i> in the future so that one could query an OpenOCD executable to see what it
</I>&gt;<i> supports in terms of target and interface hardware.  It might be possible to
</I>&gt;<i> just make it part of the version command so that an external program can
</I>&gt;<i> query for what devices can be used for debugging.  Or it could be a command
</I>&gt;<i> issued over the telnet or GDB connection.  Thoughts?
</I>
&quot;interface_list&quot; does part of that today.  Characterizing boards,
and the variety of ARM chips, is ... less obvious.


&gt;<i> Anyway, lengthy email aside, I appreciate anyone's input on this as I build
</I>&gt;<i> up a spec for a GUI.  If the guys from the OpenOCD-GUI project on
</I>&gt;<i> Sourceforge are on this list and are willing to talk Java, or convince me of
</I>&gt;<i> another method, don't hesitate to contact me off list.  Thanks for any input
</I>&gt;<i> from users and developers out there.
