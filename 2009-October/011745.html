I checked it in for 0.3.x ... on the grounds that, as I noted,
it's cleanup that can't create bugs.  Doesn't change code flow.

And there's no evident plan for 0.3.x anyway; I've been kind
of hoping we'd have cut an RC a few weeks back.  If we had
shipped an RC, I'd have at least asked before merging those.
If we were almost ready to ship &quot;final&quot;, I wouldn't even
have proposed merging them; they're fine, but non-essential.)

</I>
That's a good question.  I think your parsing cleanups would be
less safe -- they change code flow.  So they'd not be good to
merge at this point in the release cycle.  Sometime during the
merge window for 0.4.0, for sure.  

(Where &quot;this point&quot; is &quot;WAY overdue to cut an RC&quot;... we've
more or less been stabilizing forever.)
