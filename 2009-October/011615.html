Actually I think MCR/MRC is probably appropriate.  When you look
at how these &quot;coprocessor registers&quot; are specified ... they really
boil down to fourteen bits in the MCR/MRC instructions, plus one
more stipulated by the use of MCR/MRC instead of MCR2/MRC2.

Or, for 64 bit values, MCRR{,2}/MRRC{,2} also have 15-bit register
specs.  Same deal:  the register is specified as an N-tuple of bits
that are parameters to the instruction:  CRn, CRm, Opcode_1, Opcode_2,
and the conceptual bit indicated by e.g. MRRC vs MRRC2.

So unless you treat &quot;read_cp&quot; as just an instruction rename (and
maybe passing MRC-vs-MRC2 as Yet Another Parameter), you're not going
to get away from doing exactly what the mrc and mcr routines do...

</I>
Not persuasive.  We can speculate on all kinds of things that
haven't happened yet.  The *point* of the coprocessor stuff is
that it can be accessed through instructions, integrating with
the CPU pipeline.  That's what distinguishes coprocessors from
random memory-mapped peripherals ... or from DSPs which are 
fully independent and communicate via memory or mailboxes.

If some particular coprocessor creates a custom debug interface,
and advertises itself in the ROM table, that's another thing.
It would be a bunch of special case work to talk to it.  But
that wouldn't obsolete instruction based access.
