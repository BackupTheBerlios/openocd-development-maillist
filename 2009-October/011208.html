</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for checking.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How stable do you find the XScale support, by the way?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Looks quite stable to me. I use it regularly at home on IXP42x (I have a
BDI2000 at work), mostly in the mode of &quot;reset halt / erase &amp; program
flash / reset run&quot;, plus from time to time some gdb-based debugging. I
had some problems with breakpoints, but forcing hard breakpoints seems
to fix that.

Debugging inside the Linux kernel seems a bit tricky for now.

&gt;<i> I found a write-to-old-stackframe bug, and checked in a
</I>&gt;<i> fix for it ... that may have made things a bit better,
</I>&gt;<i> but it's hard to tell since the behavior varies wildly.   
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Seeing that this is almost the only driver that uses
</I>&gt;<i> the code to validate DR scans -- and observing those
</I>&gt;<i> warning firing pretty regularly -- says to me that
</I>&gt;<i> some strange behavior is common here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've observed two reset-related problems.  One is that
</I>&gt;<i> the initial &quot;reset&quot; (from TCL command line) will not
</I>&gt;<i> often work.  I've got a workaround I'm not yet ready
</I>&gt;<i> to send around.  My theory is that the original work
</I>&gt;<i> on this code was on a second generation core (PXA270,
</I>&gt;<i> like your IXP425 -- 7 bit IR length) while this first
</I>&gt;<i> generation core (PXA255) is a bit more finickey.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I have not had any reset problems or instabilities on IXP42x for quite
some time now (longer back than 0.2.0 release). I have used both Rev.
2.0 and Rev. 2.1 IXP42x CPUs, although I think there is no real
difference in the core.

&gt;<i> The second is that the *second* reset won't work at all.
</I>&gt;<i> AND ... this seems like something any XScale should
</I>&gt;<i> be seeing.  The root cause being that it won't reload
</I>&gt;<i> the debug handler after it's purged from the mini-icache.
</I>&gt;<i> (TRST clears DCSR.H ... and SRST purges the mini-icache
</I>&gt;<i> unless that bit is set.  QED.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Have you observed that problem with the second reset?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
What kind of &quot;second&quot;?

Using &quot;reset halt&quot; or &quot;reset run&quot; multiple times without re-starting
OpenOCD works fine for me.
