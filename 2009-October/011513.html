<PRE>I'm actually for some form of bug database.  You're going to have problems
like those described regardless of what system you use.  At least with a bug
database, things are a bit more transparent.  You also gain features like
email notification when a bug is updated, fixed, etc.  It's much easier for
an end user to report a bug and then be notified when the bug is resolved.
It just takes some time for a developer to mark a bug fixed once they get it
fixed.  With a text file and this mailing list we are making the problem
more manual and difficult to manage for both end users and developers.  I
don't have the experience that these other guys have, but I'd be willing to
help manage a bug database if we moved in that direction.  I think bad bug
trackers are just indicators that nobody is managing the bugs.  I would
think that if there was some one dedicated to managing the database, that
sort of problem won't happen.

As another note, it wouldn't be that hard to leverage Sourceforge's
capabilities to track the bugs.
