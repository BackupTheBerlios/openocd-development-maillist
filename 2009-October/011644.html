<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>OK, so up until recently things were very simple. I did 
 svn checkout <A HREF="svn://svn.berlios.de/openocd/trunk">svn://svn.berlios.de/openocd/trunk</A>
once and then 
 svn update 
whenever I wanted to get up-to-date and see how well
'latest' worked for me. I could have a different 'favourite' checkout
in another dir with 
 svn checkout -r 1613 <A HREF="svn://svn.berlios.de/openocd/trunk">svn://svn.berlios.de/openocd/trunk</A> svn1613

That was fine and I understood how it worked.

Now, today I want to test latest (for svf behaviour), but so far as I
can tell, none of the above is any use anymore because everything has
moved to git. Are check-ins still being copied over to maintain the
svn repo so I can in fact do 'svn up' and get 'latest master' so I can
carry on like before for a little while until things have settled down?

If not then someone badly needs to write down for complete numpties
like me who never got beyond svn and quilt how to checkout/test/send
patches to openocd.

I looked at the 'getting openocd' link on berlios:
<A HREF="http://openocd.berlios.de/web/?page_id=47">http://openocd.berlios.de/web/?page_id=47</A>
but that doesn't say anything about what to type.

I looked at the sf page linked from the 'we are moving to git'
annoucnement:
<A HREF="http://openocd.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=openocd/openocd;a=summary">http://openocd.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=openocd/openocd;a=summary</A>

And that has a load of stuff but I still don't see any info telling me
how to download a copy?

I tried the manual and that provided what looks like good info on
submitting patches in the 'Patch Primer', but I still didn't find out
how to check out the code.

Now, I'm following the list and have a reasonable idea what's going,
and I actually want to check out latest openocd and test it but I've
failed to discover that information, so I think we have an information
gap.

It may well be that if I was a git person it would simply be obvious
what to do with the sf.net summary page
<A HREF="http://openocd.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=openocd/openocd;a=summary">http://openocd.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=openocd/openocd;a=summary</A>
but I'm not so it isn't. 

Indeed, I'd much prefer not to have to learn to use git in order to
just update my existing svn checkout and test as I have in the past,
but I guess that's just wishful thinking :-)

Also given all the discussion of branches and the title of David's
mails:
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2009-October/011489.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2009-October/011489.html</A>

I'm not even sure that the stuff I want to test is in the canonical
sf.net git branch. Is it? How do I find out? Is there special git
magic for getting latest and then applying patches from the mailing
list? or is david maintaining a different git repo with this stuff in.
Should I just pull from that?

So. 

1) I think one of you guys that understands this needs to make sure
that the 'downloading openocd' page tells both users and developers
what runes they need.

2) Can someone tell me the runes I need (assuming that I am a
_complete_ git idiot that has done 'apt-get install git') to get
whichever branch has david's svf changes in. I'm assuming that the
build process itself hasn't changed at all?

I realise all this is in some flux at the moment, and I'm asking dumb
questions because git scares me, but I don't suppose I'm unusual in
that, and I think some of us are in danger of falling off the back of
the openocd train without a bit of help.

As someone said in another thread: 'The important thing is that testing
is easy'.

Wookey
