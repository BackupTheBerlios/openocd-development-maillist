Not sure I agree about &quot;unreasonable&quot;.  It's pretty routine
to avoid merging incomplete patch series.  *Especially* when
releases are overdue...

The thing to do is keep working on the patches in your local
work area.  Whether managed by quilt or something on top of
a version of the standard tree; or as a branch in git; or as
something else entirely.

I don't think I've *ever* worked in a commercial project that
didn't routinely hold back work for short to long periods,
until both (a) the work was ready and (b) the project as a
whole was ready.

This gets back to &quot;merge windows&quot;.  If the merge window is
open, completed patch series are generally good to merge.
Otherwise it's time to hold back.
