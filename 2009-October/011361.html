At what point are you putting the scope there ... while SRST
is supposed to be held high via &quot;jtag_reset&quot;?  Or during a
sequence like &quot;reset halt&quot; on an ARM11?

I have an Olimex &quot;Tiny&quot;, and have no reason to believe that
SRST isn't working there... to the contrary, with one board
where resets were malfunctioning, I used &quot;jtag_reset&quot; to force
SRST active and *OBSERVED IT* being active (low) next to the
JTAG connector.

The problem in that case proved to be that the nSRST signal
got routed through a CPLD, which promptly ignored it when
deciding whether to issue a reset to the CPU.  Power-up, yes
that matters; reset button; yes; nSRST via JTAG, ignored.  :(

Now if you suggest the same thing is true (nSRST vanishing on
the way to the CPU) on that fairly complex ARM11 board stack,
I can try to verify that.  I *think* I have schematics for that
revision of the CPU card ... but I'd be surprised if such a bug
made it through several dozen revisions of that card (and the
chips found on it).


&#216;yvind pointed out that the arm11 reset logic was not
currently issuing nSRST.  So that would affect certain
experiments ... but not one that went straight to the
JTAG layer to activate SRST.
