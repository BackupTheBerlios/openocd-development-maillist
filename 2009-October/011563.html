<PRE>Hi all,

There has been talk about creating branches on the server, but
local branches eliminate the pressing need for public branches.
I believe public branches often result in tragedy of the commons;
without clear ownership, they may not be managed as efficiently as with
branches managed wholly individual developers.  Cleanup is a problem.

Last night, I started creating a mirror of my repository (as a fork on
repo.or.cz).  While I am having problems trying to push my branches, our
past issues were resolved by its maintainer promptly, so something
should appear there soon enough.  I encourage other active developers to
follow a similar approach, so let me know if a similar attempt works for
you on that site.  

Pulling between repositories should be much easier than sending patches
or working with centrally managed branches:  that's no better than SVN.
Further, any mistakes in these branches will be localized to the clones,
rather than getting pushed into the main repository.  It seems like it
will be sufficient to post &quot;pull requests&quot; to visit (or pull from) these
mirrors rather than sending the long series of patches through here, and
this takes advantage of the full P2P potential that GIT has to offer.

This avoids proliferation of unfinished branches on SF.net and keeps
pressure on a branch's author(s) to get the changes finished and merged.

Cheers,

Zach
