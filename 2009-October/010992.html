Hmm.  I changed the diagnostics a bit in a recent patch, and
that leaves it in a good position to just switch over to
using the value and mask provided with TAP declaration.

Doing it that way ... and the i.mx31 and i.mx25 could both
just declare a capture value (or mask!) of zero and have
it all work OK -- right?  If so, could you work up a patch
which does it that way?  I suspect that could merge in time
for the 0.3.x release, then.

Thing is, we do have wierd hardware to cope with and so we
evidently need to relax that test.  But the original code
was a hack since it relaxed it for *everything* instead of
just for the minority of cases which really needed it.  And
on top of that, there was no comment explaining what class
of wierdness was involved...
