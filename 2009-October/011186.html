Thanks for checking.

How stable do you find the XScale support, by the way?

I found a write-to-old-stackframe bug, and checked in a
fix for it ... that may have made things a bit better,
but it's hard to tell since the behavior varies wildly.   

Seeing that this is almost the only driver that uses
the code to validate DR scans -- and observing those
warning firing pretty regularly -- says to me that
some strange behavior is common here.

I've observed two reset-related problems.  One is that
the initial &quot;reset&quot; (from TCL command line) will not
often work.  I've got a workaround I'm not yet ready
to send around.  My theory is that the original work
on this code was on a second generation core (PXA270,
like your IXP425 -- 7 bit IR length) while this first
generation core (PXA255) is a bit more finickey.

The second is that the *second* reset won't work at all.
AND ... this seems like something any XScale should
be seeing.  The root cause being that it won't reload
the debug handler after it's purged from the mini-icache.
(TRST clears DCSR.H ... and SRST purges the mini-icache
unless that bit is set.  QED.)

Have you observed that problem with the second reset?
