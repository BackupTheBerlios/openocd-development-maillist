</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Could you elaborate on what you're using?  And how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the git tags relate to the release labels?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Example, currently I see:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - 0.3.0-rc0 ... label on tarballs
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> which was my intention.
</I>
Right ...


&gt;<i> &gt; Or from the git tree:
</I>       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - 0.3.0-rc1-dev ... what &quot;info openoccd.info&quot; reports
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Really?  I just looked inside the packages I uploaded, and that is not
</I>&gt;<i> what they appear to report.
</I>
This is from the git tree.  Identifying as RC1 there, but
that's not the tag:


&gt;<i> &gt;  - v0.3.0-rc0-1-gb628207 ... what &quot;git describe&quot; says
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Because the tag is v0.3.0, which is what I thought was our convention
</I>&gt;<i> (after v0.2.0).  The 1 is from the version bump that followed the tag.
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest adding the 'v' in the openocd.c and openocd.texi files. ;)
</I>
Adding the &quot;v&quot; would be fine, but that's not the issue
which I was highlighting.

The issue is that the tree is identifying itself as RC1,
which DOES NOT EXIST, while the tag correctly reports the
situation as being deltas against RC0.

 
&gt;<i> &gt;  - 0.3.0-rc1-dev-00001-gb628207-dirty ... from &quot;openocd -v&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was confused by this too.  Then, I realized that you must be building
</I>&gt;<i> from Git.  Is your working copy clean?   If you build from the tarball,
</I>&gt;<i> what does it say? ;)  That's what counts, after all....
</I>
As I said above -- from git.  And the issue is that it's
identifying as RC1, which doesn't exist.  The &quot;-dirty&quot;
doesn't matter here; it just means I've got patches
layered on top.  (It's a working tree after all!)


&gt;<i> &gt; so it's not very consistent.  Tree says rc1 but that's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not what the tag says...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I ran the following commands from the top of the current tree:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   git checkout master
</I>&gt;<i>   tools/release/version.sh bump rc  # added -rc0  (could add by hand)
</I>&gt;<i>   tools/release.sh --next=rc release  # tag and start v0.3.0-rc1-dev
</I>
It's that &quot;start v0.3.0-rc1-dev&quot; which is IMO the problem.
In a couple ways:

 - We have no RC1, so we shouldn't pitch *anything* as
   being related to RC1 until we have one.

 - In fact, we don't even know if there *will* be an RC1.
   So the followon to &quot;rc0&quot; should not be &quot;rc1&quot;; it could
   be &quot;rc0-dev&quot; though.  (Or v0.4.0 ... we can't know
   until we establish whether more bugfixes are due.)

 - The &quot;git describe&quot; info doesn't match &quot;openocd -v&quot;.

Another way to look at it:  if you take a patch and apply it
to (a) a release, (b) a snapshot, and (c) git HEAD right after
the release, the versions *should* all pretty much agree.

But now, they will not agree ... since HEAD (and snapshots
derived from it) all claim to be some mythical RC1.

And when there's a real RC1 release, it will have updates
that don't appear in any other version tagged &quot;RC1&quot;.  That
adds confusion... developers can't even ask &quot;Are you using
RC1?  That bug was fixed in RC1.&quot;


&gt;<i>   # gives you on v0.3.0-rc1-dev branch to review, and pkgs in archives/
</I>&gt;<i>   git checkout master
</I>&gt;<i>   git merge v0.3.0-rc1-dev
</I>&gt;<i>   git push sf master
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If we want to release -rc1, then it's just:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   tools/release.sh --next=rc release  # tag and start v0.3.0-rc2-dev
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If we think we're ready, we could instead release the final v0.3.0 with:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   tools/release.sh --final --next=minor release  # start v0.4.0-dev
</I>
The version labeling should change, IMO.

 
&gt;<i> If we want to start v0.4.0-rc0-dev instead, then add --start-rc to that.
</I>&gt;<i> Both variations are worth trying, as they take slightly different paths.
</I>&gt;<i> For example, the script archives NEWS with major/minor releases.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At the moment, the script seems to have performed admirably.  I just ran
</I>&gt;<i> a check to confirm this (simulating -rc1), and you should be able to do
</I>&gt;<i> that for yourself now.
</I>
I'll do that at some point, but the issue I'm referring to is
not about whether the tools _work_ but instead about the version
labeling.

I don't think anything should be labeled RC1 (etc) until that
version has been released.  We should be able to say that such
and such a bug was &quot;fixed in RC1&quot; (etc) and not have any
confusion at all.

But as it stands ... RC1 isn't really a milestone, it's two
different milestones.  Confusion.
