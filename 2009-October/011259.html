</I>&gt;<i> The issue with MinGW right now is that it does not (want to) support the

</I>&gt;<i> some background of which is highlighted in this thread:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.mingw.announce/1363">http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.mingw.announce/1363</A>).
</I>
Or in short:  Microsoft still doesn't obey standards it doesn't control.
And MinGW is following their line.  Even when told a &quot;--std=...&quot; to use.


&gt;<i> Now, I do realize now that I inadvertently used PRI*i*64 instead of PRI*d*64
</I>&gt;<i> in my patch for %lld replacement (which is plain wrong). Is that why the
</I>&gt;<i> %lld -&gt; PRI#64 modifications were rejected?
</I>
I have no problem at all with PRIu64 when used with uint64_t.
However, using it with other types doesn't necessarily work.


&gt;<i> If so, I'll make sure resubmit with PRId64.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If not, my understanding (from
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf#printf_format_placeholders">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf#printf_format_placeholders</A>) that ISO C99
</I>&gt;<i> mandates the use of PRI#64 as a replacement for %ll# in printf statements.
</I>
Read more carefully.  It doesn't say they are always equivalent; it
just says they often are.  PRIu64 pairs with uint64_t and so on, but
uint64_t need not be &quot;long long&quot; ... so using PRIu64 and passing a
&quot;long long&quot; is not necessarily going to work.


&gt;<i> Therefore I would believe that 'printf(&quot;value: %lld\n&quot;, val)' is completely
</I>&gt;<i> equivalent to 'printf(&quot;value: &quot; PRId64 &quot;\n&quot;, val)', and should not break
</I>&gt;<i> anything on any platform - on the contrary, it should make the code even
</I>&gt;<i> more portable.
</I>
Only when &quot;val&quot; is of type &quot;int64_t&quot;.


&gt;<i> Or am I misunderstanding something about the use of the PRI#64 modifiers?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As to &quot;%zu&quot; and &quot;%jd&quot;, those modifiers were also rejected by MinGW-W64
</I>&gt;<i> (&quot;unknown conversion type character in format&quot;), eventhough they're ISO C99.
</I>
Seems the MinGW compiler should then reject the &quot;--std=...&quot; command line
parameter... that's really the root cause here.  We're telling it to conform
to that standard, and it's refusing.  Nothing to do with Microsoft; just with
the toolchain falsely claiming conformance.


&gt;<i> From looking around, I think there's probably a way to get MinGW to accept
</I>&gt;<i> them, which would alleviate the need for a patch.
</I>

points out that PRIdMAX and similar printf/scanf formats exist.
That should help with &quot;%jd&quot; at least, but there weren't many spots
where that was the issue.
