As of Friday 12:01 AM UTC?  Making it Thursday 5:01 pm PST?
Sure.  In fact, tag it as 0.3.0-rc1 ?

The &quot;shut down&quot; is maintainer discipline, obviously, nothing
technical.

But ... I'm not sure &quot;bugfixes only&quot; is 100% the right metric.
That's the basic mindset, yes.  But new drivers are examples
of things that can safely merge pretty late, since they won't
break any existing users and are at the worst partial bugfixes
for the &quot;hardware X won't work at all&quot; bug.  And there might
be other examples.  (I'm just pointing out that the line isn't
quite that hard.)


&gt;<i> - that we can agree that major features are developed in public
</I>&gt;<i> branches on repo.or.cz and then applied to sf when they
</I>&gt;<i> are as ready as they are going to be. Communication can be

</I>
We don't need branches for everything; just large related
groups of patches.  And we don't need to store branches at
that site, either.  (Separate discussion to be had about
branches and when they're wanted, but I just wanted to make
those basic points.)

 
&gt;<i> W.r.t. testing I believe that we have to push changes to sf master
</I>&gt;<i> before they are tested beyond the few developers working on
</I>&gt;<i> a particular feature branch.
</I>
Yes.  And that's true for minor &quot;features&quot; too.


&gt;<i> How does that sound as a first tiny step towards improving our
</I>&gt;<i> process &amp; getting 0.3 out of the door?
</I>
I'm all for getting 0.3 out in a week.  If Wookey can
report that one patch of mine makes XSVF work for him,
that'd be great and I'd want to merge that bugfix.  But
otherwise I don't know of anything that'd make me want
to hold back from 0.3 going out tomorrow....
