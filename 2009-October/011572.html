This makes a certain amount of sense to me, but it does point out the
fact that some targets do not have an MMU.  Is that feature worthy of
abstracting away from the core target support?  Probably, but many
lesser evils should be banished before attempting a proper solution to
that nightmarishly grandiose proposition.

Combined with the above, we would need to distinguish between the two
different cases: &quot;not yet implemented&quot; and &quot;cannot be implemented&quot;.

&gt;<i> The optional [phys] argument to mww/mdw variants is still there for

</I>&gt;<i> (there aren't any Cortex M0/M3's w/MMU are there?).

It should detect and report the correct situation, as above.

&gt;<i> Which brings me to another thing...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Should commands that *could* be supported by targets be added
</I>&gt;<i> even if the OpenOCD target code does not support it them?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If users are searching for the right way to do mrc/mcr operations
</I>&gt;<i> for, say, XScale, would it not be better if the command was there
</I>&gt;<i> but returned &quot;not implemented&quot;?
</I>
Users should see commands for targets that can be supported, and
commands that a target will never support should be hidden.  If a user
tries to use a command that should be implemented but isn't, then they
can report their attempt so we may prioritize (or be reminded of) their
required implementation.  

If support for a feature must be probed, that information could be used
to influence the UI more.  In the real world, we want to KISS with our
command handling code as much as possible, so a good solution will
strike some balance between the extremes.  To wit, the parsing code can
be made to fail gracefully when requested features are found missing,
but adaptive help strings would be going too far (for now).

This all said, we should avoid pushing new features that have not been
fully implemented in the first place. :)

Cheers,

Zach
