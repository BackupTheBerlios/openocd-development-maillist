Following on some discussion in other threads, I have gone ahead and
created a new 'openocd/testing' fork on repo.or.cz:

This fork will allow anyone to commit on the mob branch:

  <A HREF="http://repo.or.cz/mob.html">http://repo.or.cz/mob.html</A>

but be sure to post a message telling us your branch head, so subsequent
commits to that branch do not cause the changes to be lost.

I will give other maintainers push access upon request, so this can
serve as our community sandbox.

For clarity, the cycle of development should go something like this:

1) Clone from the sacred SF.net (or its mirror on repo.or.cz).
2) Commit branch in your local repository.
3) Push to repo.or.cz with propery Signed-off-by lines:
4) Maintainer pulls branch into testing repository mainline.
5) Push branch after it receives sufficient Signed-off-by lines.
6) Go to step 2 if serious rebasing would be required before step 5.

For non-maintainers, this still involves the usual process:
1) git clone
2) git checkout -b abc/fixes
3) git -m 'Some changes...' ....
3) git push <A HREF="git://repo.or.cz/openocd/testing.git">git://repo.or.cz/openocd/testing.git</A> abc/fixes:mob

This cycle eliminates the churn caused by repeating steps 2-5
indefinitely from ever reaching the master repository.  Basically, it
provides the central repository, but in an isolated environment.

Cheers,

Zach
