<PRE>We added two overridable procedures; document them, and the
two jtag arp_* operations they necessarily expose.

Update the comment about the jtag_init_reset() routine; it's
been obsolete for as long as it's had SRST support.

<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">+ at section</A> Custom Reset Handling
+
+OpenOCD has several ways to help support the various reset
+mechanisms provided by chip and board vendors.
+The commands shown in the previous section give standard parameters.
+There are also @emph{event handlers} associated with TAPs or Targets.
+Those handlers are Tcl procedures you can provide, which are invoked
+at particular points in the reset sequence.
+
+After configuring those mechanisms, you might still
+find your board doesn't start up or reset correctly.
+For example, maybe it needs a slightly different sequence
+of SRST and/or TRST manipulations, because of quirks that
+the @command{reset_config} mechanism doesn't address;
+or asserting both might trigger a stronger reset, which
+needs special attention.
+
+Experiment with lower level operations, such as @command{jtag_reset}
+and the @command{jtag arp_*} operations shown here,
+to find a sequence of operations that works.
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">+ at xref</A>{JTAG Commands}.
+When you find a working sequence, it can be used to override
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">+ at command</A>{jtag_init}, which fires during OpenOCD startup
+(@pxref{Configuration Stage});
+or @command{init_reset}, which fires during reset processing.
+
+You might also want to provide some project-specific reset
+schemes.  For example, on a multi-target board the standard
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">+ at command</A>{reset} command would reset all targets, but you
+may need the ability to reset only one target at time and
+thus want to avoid using the board-wide SRST signal.
+
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">+ at deffn</A> {Overridable Procedure} init_reset mode
+This is invoked near the beginning of the @command{reset} command,
+usually to provide as much of a cold (power-up) reset as practical.
+By default it is also invoked from @command{jtag_init} if
+the scan chain does not respond to pure JTAG operations.
+The @var{mode} parameter is the parameter given to the
+low level reset command (@option{halt},
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">+ at option</A>{init}, or @option{run}), @option{setup},
+or potentially some other value.
+
+The default implementation just invokes @command{jtag arp_init-reset}.
+Replacements will normally build on low level JTAG
+operations such as @command{jtag_reset}.
+Operations here must not address individual TAPs
+(or their associated targets)
+until the JTAG scan chain has first been verified to work.
+
+Implementations must have verified the JTAG scan chain before
+they return.
+This is done by calling @command{jtag arp_init}
+(or @command{jtag arp_init-reset}).

<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">+ at deffn</A> Command {jtag arp_init}
+This validates the scan chain using just the four
+standard JTAG signals (TMS, TCK, TDI, TDO).
+It starts by issuing a JTAG-only reset.
+Then it performs checks to verify that the scan chain configuration
+matches the TAPs it can observe.
+Those checks include checking IDCODE values for each active TAP,
+and verifying the length of their instruction registers using
+TAP @code{-ircapture} and @code{-irmask} values.
+If these tests all pass, TAP @code{setup} events are
+issued to all TAPs with handlers for that event.
