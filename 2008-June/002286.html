See <A HREF="http://www.lua.org/uses.html">http://www.lua.org/uses.html</A> - it gets an amazing amount of exposure in WoW, 
Warhammer and Garry's Mod and Adobe Photoshop Lightroom. My usage has been in 
stuff where the user gets to play around with things where you just cannot 
second guess what they want and so an interpreter with some level of safety is 
required.

What area were you planning on hooking in first - it isn't hard to hook lua into 
something at get extensions going pretty quickly. I'd tend to think about the 
functions you want to have (whether you are doing tcl or lua) and from that list 
work forward as to what would make sense. Basically looking at the existing 
configuration file and how it would be expressed in tcl or lua to get a feel for 
what the result would be like.

Tim.
