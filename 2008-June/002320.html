Agreed.

Having a script close to what you need as a starting point of course
a benefit of the target lib already. Most times there should be a script
that is a working starting point.


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - write a flash driver in tcl. A flash driver consists of &quot;a few peeks
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and pokes&quot;. Could a tcl script handle this for non-standard parts?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think this would perform really bad. Flash drivers without semi-hosting
</I>&gt;<i> are slow on high latency JTAG interfaces even if written in C.
</I>
I'm thinking that these drivers would be implemetned by OpenOCD
developers and not users. It would be nice if users would implement
their own flash drivers, but that is a really big leap from where we are today.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The eCos + ocl flash drivers have had zero visible success.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sad but true, however, I am planning to do some more work on this.
</I>
I'd like to build the eCos CFI driver with as many drivers as possible.


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - write variant target support in tcl. The slight arm7/9 variants
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> could perhaps be written in tcl?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have to say, that I do not like such idea at all, I doubt that end users
</I>&gt;<i> would cope with TCL (or anything else)
</I>&gt;<i> to create target variant support. This is rather unlikely. And for
</I>&gt;<i> developers - mixture of two languages does not bring benefits, it would just
</I>&gt;<i> make things more complicated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I do not really see the benefit of splitting the source code for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> developers into two languages. Having a full-fledged scripting language for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> configuration is great,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> however, if I need to learn another language to add/modify/patch openocd
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> code (like the CFI flash driver), I will be reluctant to do so.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another problem: how do you debug a mixture of C and script code?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Currently, I can start up gdb on openocd and see everything that happens.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My words, I do not see a benefit.
</I>&gt;<i> However, scripting for configuration is fine (but not a necessity from my
</I>&gt;<i> point of view).
</I>
Can you show an example of scripting used in configuration?

I'm trying to come up with a killer example :-)
