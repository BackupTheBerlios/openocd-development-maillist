Hello Edgar,

Edgar Grimberg napsal(a):
&gt;&gt;<i> PRESTO keeps TCK high between its commands (which is a necessity),
</I>&gt;<i> Why is this necessary? If you look at the bitbang.c driver, you can see 
</I>&gt;<i> that clock is kept low when idle. ( CLOCK_IDLE() is 0 ) Is bitbang broken?
</I>
PRESTO has nothing to do with bitbang driver, TCK high between commands is a necessity for PRESTO,
it is it's internal thing. If TCK is to be put back low after every tick, the performance impact would be dramatic
(slow down several times). So this is purely internal to PRESTO.

If we omit resets, JTAG is synchronous and everything is defined by standard, so the upper layer shall
not care about what any driver does in between the processing of buffered data as long as the signal edges
go in the right order.

However, reset lines cause problems, as it is not defined when (at which TCK phase) they should change
(they are assumed to be asynchronous).
The patch just ensures that reset lines are changed while TCK is low, nothing more or less.

Best regards,
   Pavel
