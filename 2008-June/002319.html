Hello Michael and &#216;yvind,

</I>
I agree on this... modification of a script is often necessary to make it work with given hw.

&gt;&gt;<i> - write a flash driver in tcl. A flash driver consists of &quot;a few peeks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and pokes&quot;. Could a tcl script handle this for non-standard parts?
</I>
I think this would perform really bad. Flash drivers without semi-hosting are slow
on high latency JTAG interfaces even if written in C.

&gt;&gt;<i> The eCos + ocl flash drivers have had zero visible success.
</I>
Sad but true, however, I am planning to do some more work on this.

&gt;&gt;<i> - write variant target support in tcl. The slight arm7/9 variants
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could perhaps be written in tcl?
</I>
I have to say, that I do not like such idea at all, I doubt that end users would cope with TCL (or anything else)
to create target variant support. This is rather unlikely. And for developers - mixture of two languages does not bring 
benefits, it would just make things more complicated.

&gt;<i> I do not really see the benefit of splitting the source code for developers into two languages. Having a full-fledged scripting language for configuration is great,
</I>&gt;<i> however, if I need to learn another language to add/modify/patch openocd code (like the CFI flash driver), I will be reluctant to do so.
</I>&gt;<i> Another problem: how do you debug a mixture of C and script code? Currently, I can start up gdb on openocd and see everything that happens.
</I>
My words, I do not see a benefit.
However, scripting for configuration is fine (but not a necessity from my point of view).

Regards,
   Pavel
