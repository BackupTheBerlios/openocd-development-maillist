Heh, just convince me that it can be removed without loosing functionality, or
sacrificing performance on the current main platforms (PC + parallel port
Wiggler or FT2232), and we'll remove it.

&gt;<i> &gt; The original reason for including it was &quot;int
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; embeddedice_read_reg_w_check()&quot; when called via
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; arm7_9_execute_fast_sys_speed(), which in turn gets called from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; arm7_9_read_memory() or arm7_9_write_memory when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; arm7_9-&gt;fast_memory_access is set.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The application-specific code schedules the necessary JTAG operations,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and doesn't have to access any data returned via JTAG execept for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; actual target-data returned in the read case. The JTAG subsystem is able
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to decide on its own whether there was an error during the operation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What about the in_handler? It too can cause failure. Can a suitable
</I>&gt;<i> in_handler synthesize the in_check_value/mask behaviour?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, I think it could. The in_handler takes a void* argument, that could hold
pointers to the expected value and mask.
I didn't suggest this approach because I got the feeling that the in_handler
concept would be even more complicated for &quot;smart&quot; JTAG hardware than the
check_value/mask stuff when I first thought about accelerated JTAG (almost
two years ago, i guess), but after looking into this issue again I think it's
possible.

That would allow us to remove the in_check_mask/value fields, and use the
in_handler for the same purpose. The actual checking would be handled by a
generic in_check_value_mask() handler. That way duplicate functionality could
be removed, and we would save two pointers per scan. Maybe we could take this
a step further by optionally using &quot;static&quot; check buffers - i.e. where the
value and mask are pointers to some global memory that don't have to be freed
and allocated. This would further reduce the memory overhead, which seems to
be your major concern.

&gt;<i> I'm wondering if I could rewrite in_check to an in_handler inside
</I>&gt;<i> jtag_xxx() functions
</I>&gt;<i> and have a compatible API...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That would serve my purpose since a fresh implementation of jtag_xxx()
</I>&gt;<i> would then
</I>&gt;<i> be able to reuse that code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The only alternative I can see would be an in_value buffer for every
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; embeddedice_read_reg_w_check scan that's then parsed by the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; application-specific code after the call to jtag_execute_queue().
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The in_handler functions that do this parsing do not have to be very
</I>&gt;<i> application specific. The
</I>&gt;<i> application would then choose some in_handler that does what is needed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The same is true for the scan_n check - every code that (indirectly)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; schedules a SCAN_N operation would have to maintain a buffer for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in_values from the SCAN_N operations it executes, and sometimes it can't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; even know whether a call to SCAN_N really results in a SCAN_N operation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (if the requested scan chain is already selected we silently return
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without scheduling a scan).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not familiar with the scan_n check. Can you give me a pointer?
</I>
Sorry, SCAN_N was a bad example, it's currently disabled anyway. According to
the ARM documents there should always be b1000[0] (SCAN_N is 5 bits on ARM9,
and 4 bits on ARM7) in the SCAN_N register when moving to Capture-DR with the
the SCAN_N instruction selected. My original code used this check to verify
communication integrity, but several ARM implementations like the ARM7TDMI-S
Rev4 (e.g. LPC2000) apparently violate this rule. That's why the check is
disabled by an #ifdef _ARM_JTAG_SCAN_N_CHECK_.

A better example is arm_jtag_set_instr(). The ARM documents guarantee that 0x1
is loaded into the instruction register when moving through Capture-IR, and
the OpenOCD uses this check to verify communication integrity.

When working with an LPC3180 (ARM926EJ-S + ETB) I found that setting the JTAG
instruction failed after talking to scan chain 15 (system control
coprocessor). For whatever reason the IR Scan through the ETB fails the first
time after accessing scan chain 15. The instruction register of the ARM926
(&quot;first&quot; in line when seen from TDI) gets set correctly, but the ETB's
(&quot;second&quot;, with its TDI connected to the ARM926's TDO) instruction register
isn't correctly accessed, and the LP3180's TDO pin outputs all 1s or 0s for
the IR scan.
This behaviour was the reason to include the error_handler concept.
arm_jtag_set_instr() by default uses debug handler that outputs an error
informing the user about potentially broken debug behaviour, but allows
calling code to specify an error handler of its own, which the arm926 code
uses to specify a handler that catches the known-broken case of 0x0f or 0x0.

&gt;<i> &gt; Similar reasons exist for all other occurences of in_check_value/mask. It
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; greatly simplifies the deferred error checking for large queues of JTAG
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scan operations.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't think we want to remove the error checking - JTAG communication
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can easily fail - and currently I don't think it's practical to move that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; error handling to the application specific code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think there is a significant upside here in terms of simplification
</I>&gt;<i> and performance. This
</I>&gt;<i> based on measurements/profiling and not only a hunch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you are not yet convinced that there is an upside here, please bear
</I>&gt;<i> with me and help
</I>&gt;<i> work a bit through the issues....
</I>
Best regards,

Dominic
