Sounds like a good way to go to me. I'd certainly like to hear
convincing arguments
why users would want to tinker w/lots of different commands once the
memory map has been
set up.

That's the way GDB went w/it's XML memory map and GDB load. I
submitted a patch to
generate the memory map based on flash a while ago, however, I like to
decide manually
when to write to flash(it takes a while to flash and I'm rather set in
my ways). Could be I
would just forget all about it and use GDB load if flash programming
was dead robust and
fast though. If you are interested, I could freshen up that GDB load
flash support patch.

It will take a bit of work to hash out(e.g. I know nand flash is
different from normal flash, but
I don't understand what is gained by exposing those differences to the
user) and personally I
think there are other higher priority items, such as sorting out
progress/error output. It's
something I'd be interested in getting back to...
