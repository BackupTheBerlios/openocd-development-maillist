I don't think so. Only RAM and NOR flash are memory mapped. NAND flash for 
example could exceed the size of a 32-bit target's address space (at least 
the &quot;free&quot; regions), and even if not there's no relationship between NAND 
pages and target addresses. On top of that a 512 byte NAND page comes with 16 
bytes of out-of-band data - there's no sane way how this could be mapped to a 
32-bit memory space.

I'm not sure if all this implied behaviour is really necessary - if someone 
wants to write flash, he ought to erase it, then write it. He should also 
also know what part of an image is written where - imho everything 
that /should/ be in flash could be contained in one plain binary, because 
after all that's how it ends up in flash.
We're already able to load ELF images into flash, and that even includes 
images spanning multiple flashes (I have yet to see a good use for that 
capability).
Behaviour like &quot;erase before write&quot; could be added if really necessary, but 
the IDE might be just as good to handle this kind of convenience functions.

I don't think you really want your debugger to treat RAM and NOR flash 
equally, either.
With the smaller embedded targets (e.g. ARM7 with internal flash) you either 
write code that's meant to run in RAM (usually for the ease of debugging) or 
you write code that's meant to run in flash (because you realized you need 
those few K of RAM for data, not code). After compiling and linking your app 
you need to get it either into RAM, or into flash - if you're not aware of 
the difference you have worse problems than having to remember two sets of 
commands.
When working with larger targets you usually just want to flash your 
bootloader - once the bootloader is working you would rarely use JTAG. A 
kernel image is loaded a lot faster via NFS or TFTP.

I'm open for arguments where a user really benefits from having the debugger 
handle any of this automag^Htically.

Best regards,

Dominic
