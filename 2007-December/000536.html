<PRE>Hi,

Attached is a patch for review, it contains the following

- autoconf 2.59 is now required and checked - due to issues with
AS_HELP_STRING
- native win32 now handles WSAECONNRESET, no longer exits openocd
- qCRC packet now works correctly under cygwin (gdb compare-sections
command)
- removed __USE_GNU define from gdbserver.c
- gdb qSupported packet is now handled, with this we are able to tell gdb
packet size, memory map of target
- added new target script gdb_program_config - see below
- new gdb command gdb_memory_map (enable|disable&gt; - see below 
- updated texi doc to include new commands
- gdb flash programming supported
- image_elf_read_section now does not clear any remaining data, this was
causing the gdb checksum to be fail with certain files

Thanks to &#216;yvind Harboe for his work on this.

With the above patch gdb is now able to query openocd for info about the
target, such as memory map and other features as they appear in gdb.

by default the memory map is not given unless gdb_memory_map enable config
option is used - your config from the flash driver will then be sent to gdb
when requested.

The nice thing about using the memory map is that gdb will know where the
flash/rom memory is and will automatically use hardware breakpoints - no
more arm7_9 force_hw_bkpts is required.

Now that gdb knows where the flash is it will also try and program it when a
gdb load command is issued. This is done by the vFlash*** packets in
gdbserver.c (again thanks to &#216;yvind Harboe for his work).

After the flash is programmed you can also on the gdb prompt verify the
contents by using the compare_sections command.

For the flash programming to work you will need a flash driver setup and a
working area (for speed) - if you try and program during a debug session
make sure the working area is backed up.
Any output text sent to gdb is ignored during programming, as gdb expects no
other messages from the gdb server.

One point is the initial packet that gdb uses for programming may be to big
- openocd will complain.
I use the following in my gdb startup script to set a smaller packet size -
i am looking into this a bit more as i would expect the new PacketSize
variable given in qSupported to include this.
set remote memory-write-packet-size 1024
set remote memory-write-packet-size fixed
set remote memory-read-packet-size 1024
set remote memory-read-packet-size fixed

The new target_script gdb_program_config is used to setup the target before
gdb programs it - i currently use it to remove sector write protection.

I have also added support for the new qXfer:features:read gdb packet -
currently it is disabled, but as gdb improves the interface it will updated.
Just nice to get the initial code in place.

Hope you all have a great xmas, time for a beer.

Cheers
Spen
