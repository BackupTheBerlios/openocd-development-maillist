&gt;<i> Hello &#216;yvind,

</I>
There is enough upside to this that I'm interested in pursuing this further.

Our hardware/sw implements *all* the jtag_xxx() functions, hence my
quest to simplify the API.

My thinking is that the jtag_xxx() functions w/a bit of tinkering and
sharpening of docs to allow for
synchronous or asynchronous execution, become the interface to the hw and that
the current jtag.c &amp; bitbanger drives would then be a reference
implementation. This would
allow for a lot of freedom to innovate at the hardware level when
implementing JTAG support.

Why you ask? Our implementation of jtag_xxx() w/a hardware fifo runs
10-100x faster than the jtag.c bitbanger alternative on our ARM7
system. E.g. memory allocation
in jtag_xxx() is a trainwrecker for a feeble ARM7. I haven't got any performance
#'s yet, but it sure looks good.

I shall stop pursuing this if there is a strong sentiment that
in_check should be
kept.

&gt;<i> The original reason for including it was &quot;int embeddedice_read_reg_w_check()&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> when called via arm7_9_execute_fast_sys_speed(), which in turn gets called
</I>&gt;<i> from arm7_9_read_memory() or arm7_9_write_memory when
</I>&gt;<i> arm7_9-&gt;fast_memory_access is set.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The application-specific code schedules the necessary JTAG operations, and
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't have to access any data returned via JTAG execept for the actual
</I>&gt;<i> target-data returned in the read case. The JTAG subsystem is able to decide
</I>&gt;<i> on its own whether there was an error during the operation.
</I>
What about the in_handler? It too can cause failure. Can a suitable in_handler
synthesize the in_check_value/mask behaviour?

I'm wondering if I could rewrite in_check to an in_handler inside
jtag_xxx() functions
and have a compatible API...

That would serve my purpose since a fresh implementation of jtag_xxx()
would then
be able to reuse that code.

&gt;<i> The only alternative I can see would be an in_value buffer for every
</I>&gt;<i> embeddedice_read_reg_w_check scan that's then parsed by the
</I>&gt;<i> application-specific code after the call to jtag_execute_queue().
</I>
The in_handler functions that do this parsing do not have to be very
application specific. The
application would then choose some in_handler that does what is needed.


&gt;<i> The same is true for the scan_n check - every code that (indirectly) schedules
</I>&gt;<i> a SCAN_N operation would have to maintain a buffer for in_values from the
</I>&gt;<i> SCAN_N operations it executes, and sometimes it can't even know whether a
</I>&gt;<i> call to SCAN_N really results in a SCAN_N operation (if the requested scan
</I>&gt;<i> chain is already selected we silently return without scheduling a scan).
</I>
I'm not familiar with the scan_n check. Can you give me a pointer?


&gt;<i> Similar reasons exist for all other occurences of in_check_value/mask. It
</I>&gt;<i> greatly simplifies the deferred error checking for large queues of JTAG scan
</I>&gt;<i> operations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think we want to remove the error checking - JTAG communication can
</I>&gt;<i> easily fail - and currently I don't think it's practical to move that error
</I>&gt;<i> handling to the application specific code.
</I>
I think there is a significant upside here in terms of simplification
and performance. This
based on measurements/profiling and not only a hunch.

If you are not yet convinced that there is an upside here, please bear
with me and help
work a bit through the issues....
