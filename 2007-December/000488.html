<PRE>One major problem with OpenOCD is that a commands do not give
feedback from the lower levels about what want went wrong and similarly
outputting progress text is difficult. E.g. flash erase/programming could do
with a bit of progress output.

Excellent error messages/progress output that point users in the right
direction is a killer feature.

There are a couple of ways the problem of error output/progress info
is adressed today:

- push cmd_ctx to lower lower levels that really have nothing to do
with cmd_ctx(e.g. flash functions). This pollutes the API and
it's cmd_ctx is still not available from all the places where it would
be useful.
- translate return codes to strings. This gives very generic and
misleading error messages without e.g. filename for a missing file.
- allocate and return a string in API functions. This is complicated
and pollutes the API.
- the information is available in the log, but it can be pretty difficult
to find the connection between the log statements and command
executed. Ideally it shouldn't be necessary to break out the log.


What I think is needed is some generic mechanism to deal with error/progress
output in a way that simplifies the code and allows better progress/error
messages. The attached patch hopes to do so without making the source
completely unrecognizable and reusing existing concepts.

In the attached patch, I leverage the existing logging mechanism to address
the problems above.


Basically it becomes possible for the caller of command_run_line() to capture
the log produced while the command was executed.


One use of this capture mechanism is to output the what is logged during
command_run_line() to the telnet session.

Some thoughts about this:

- currently OpenOCD is single threaded. Therefore the simple
implementation does the
trick.
- if OpenOCD grows multithreading(not at all unthinkable), then the
current capture
scheme still works. The short explanation here is that the logging
capture would
only log statements from the current thread.
- gdb_server should be similarly modified
- config scripts can stick to outputting only to the log as they are
&quot;background tasks&quot;.
- the timer callback should also capture output and output it to
telnet, e.g. there might be
important info w.r.t. how an asynchronous reset was handled.
- there are API functions that can be cleaned up, e.g. returning
allocated error strings
is now unnecessarily complicated and not very flexible.
- the use of error codes should be scaled back. Possibly to a boolean success
return value. If an API needs to tell the caller how to behave afterwards then
generic return codes is not a good way to go.
- today it is only possible to log lines. It would be nice to be able
to output e.g. a &quot;.&quot;
for each sector written in flash programming.
- we can incrementally improve OpenOCD without upsetting other work. The code is
still very much recognizable.

About the patch: the OpenOCD source we're using has a raft of patches
that are not
in OpenOCD trunk(yet ;-), so I backported the patch. Hopefully it will
compile &amp; work
out of the box, but I haven't tried it.
