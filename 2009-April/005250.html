<PRE>Hi everyone,

I just got a new board that I'm trying to get setup.  I new at this so I'm
sure there is plenty that I have missed.

The board is based on or very similar to a at91sam9260ek board.  It uses
u-boot 1.1.5 and my jtag interface is a Amontec jtagkey.  The version of
openocd I'm using is SVN 1411.

While searching the list archives I found a few threads that talk about the
SST39VF1601 support being added around last nov/dec of 08 but I don't see
much in the cfi.c that matches so I don't know if what I have fully supports
the SST39v or not.

I've tried using the board/unknown-board-atmel-at91sam9260.cfg as an
example.

I can post the configs &amp; logs if needed but didn't want to send a huge email
the first time ... hopefully I just need to be pointed in the right
direction and I can finish making a config that will work.

The documentation from the board says that the NOR flash (a SST39VF1601
parallel flash 16bit x 2MB) starts at 0x10000000 and is 0x1fffff long.  The
documentation says the flash is on CS0.

I put the following in my board .cfg:
flash bank cfi 0x10000000 0x001fffff 2 2 0

I don't exactly know how much initialization in the board .cfg I need to
do.  I looked for similar arm926ejs setups and I see some .cfg files setting
up the SDRAM, turning off watchdogs and doing other things and then defining
things like SMC_SETUP0, SMC_PULSE0, SMC_CYCLE0 and SMC_MODE0 using the mww
commands followed by a flash probe 0.

So here is what I'm seeing/doing so far.  As soon as I telnet to OpenOCD,
I'll halt the processor with halt and I'll usually see the yellow light on
my jtagkey flash and when I do a poll it says the target is still running.
I'll do halt again and the target will say that it is halted this time and I
don't see the yellow light flash.

Next I'll type flash banks which will return the cfi line I entered in the
config.
Next I'll do flash probe 0 which will fail.

While watching the -d3 output while trying to do the flash probe 0 ... with
one config I'll see things like:

Debug: 198 100046 arm926ejs.c:112 arm926ejs_catch_broken_irscan(): caught
ARM926EJ-S invalid Capture-IR result after CP15 access
.
.
and:
.
Debug: 279 141268 cfi.c:2206 cfi_probe(): CFI qry returned: 0x04 0xffffff98
0xffffffd3

and with yet another attempt at a config (basically
unknown-board-atmel-at91sam9260.cfg) I see things like this when I do flash
probe 0:

Debug: 229 29259 command.c:108 script_command(): script_command - probe,
argv[1]=0
Debug: 230 29260 embeddedice.c:401 embeddedice_write_reg(): 0: 0x00000004
Debug: 231 29263 embeddedice.c:401 embeddedice_write_reg(): 0: 0x00000005
Warn : 232 29267 arm7_9_common.c:2302 arm7_9_write_memory(): memory write
caused data abort (address: 0x10000aaa, size: 0x2, count: 0x1)
Debug: 233 29268 arm9tdmi.c:620 arm9tdmi_write_xpsr_im8(): xpsr_im: 13, rot:
0, spsr: 0
User : 234 29268 command.c:383 command_print(): unknown error when probing
flash bank '#0' at 0x10000000

Since I see different behavior ... it leads me to think I just don't have
enough of an environment setup for the flash probe command to work.  In one
board config all I'm doing is setting the cfi line and the SMC_SETUP0,
SMC_PULSE0, SMC_CYCLE0 and SMC_MODE0 mww commands using the u-boot source
code that inits the NOR flash and in the other board config I'm pretty much
using the unknown-board-atmel-at91sam9260.cfg config as is except for the
cfi line.  I haven't tried to unwind what all the
unknown-board-atmel-at91sam9260.cfg is doing yet.

At this point I've read the openocd.pdf, searched all over the internet and
the development list archives and have found some good stuff, I just don't
know how to apply it all yet or the steps I should take.

I'm grateful to anyone that can shepherd me through the process of getting
NOR flash to work with openocd.

Regards,

Brian
