That's not a C99 issue. You get the same optimization behavior
from gcc with non-C99 code. The optimization happened to be
introduced at about the same time as C99 support, but that was
merely a coincidence.

Visual studio will not perform this optimization. Intel's compiler will,
but Intel's compiler avoids it in pretty much every case where gcc
would be able to issue a warning. You thus can get burned when
using Intel's compiler, but you'll never see a warning.

&gt;<i> But that said, if those issues don't effect this project, it isn't a

</I>
I personally learned about the &quot;feature&quot; when dealing with a bug
in a C library for an embedded OS. It was something like signbit(),
which casted from double* to short* to look at the raw bits.

Everybody on the OS team was horrified to learn how C works. :-)
I kind of like the feature now, along with &quot;restrict&quot; pointers, because
the extra performance is nice.

Five ways to fix your code:

You can memcpy() the data. (careful: do not memcpy the pointer!)
Remember that gcc recognizes memcpy. For small things, gcc will
replace memcpy with simple load/store instructions. It's very fast.

You can access the data as type char. The key thing here is that the
actual access must be via a char* or similar. You might suppress the
warnings with multiple casts, but that doesn't solve the problem. It's
not OK to do *(int*)(void*)(char*)(void*)some_float_ptr or similar.

The gcc developers promise to let you cheat with a union. I really wish
they hadn't, because I'd greatly prefer the optimization in this case.
Declare your stuff as a union and go to town. Note that your typical case
needs to be a pointer to a union containing int and float, not a union of
pointers to different types.

You can cheat as I did, abusing assembly constraints. Like so:
#define MEMORIZE(ptr) __asm__ __volatile__(&quot;&quot;:&quot;=r&quot;(ptr):&quot;0&quot;(ptr):&quot;memory&quot;)

You can use __attribute__((__may_alias__)) on things. This grants
them the power of char.
