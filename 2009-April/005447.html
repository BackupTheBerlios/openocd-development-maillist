It has worked better in the past, but it has never worked 100% for me.
I used something in that epoch to get a working configuration running,
but I now have time to focus on fixing the current SVN trunk.

Still, this puts me with hardware that has been verified to work in
other scenarios, and I have been using the telnet interface to eliminate
GDB as a factor.  Recently, I evaluated IAR's ARM tools for a client, so
I know what remains to be achieved for us to reach full functionality.

In the end, the problem can only be OpenOCD; further, your reply to
Magnus (with your FTDI test results) indicates that the problem almost
certainly exists within the J-Link driver and not at other layers.

&gt;<i> Your yellow one, which version it is? Here I have a v6.0.
</I>
Same.  Once I know the source files are clear of pending patches, I will
start pushing changes to get the driver cleaned up and fixed.  I will do
a thorough audit of the driver against the documentation that I have and
try to find out exactly what is going wrong.

Cheers,

Zach
