Magnus,


Yes, by all means, let's not disturb the oldfashioned people.    :)    
At least not yet.


And my social contract offer with you is that I will assist you getting 
the build to work, after which I would request that you offer your most 
excellent suggestion again, as well as encourage others to try the patch 
if you like it.


However, I will not be near my computer this Friday thru Sunday.   The 
patch will work *best* at this time if:

1) you are *nix hosted
2) have your usb libraries in a standard place, preferably on the 
machine from a package manager
3) and can install CMake 2.6.2 on that machine


Other scenarios may also work, but what I am saying is that the above 
scenario is _falling_down_ easy.   2) above is least important.


If you can go to a point and then wait until I am back Monday without 
freaking out, that can work.


Thanks,

Dick
