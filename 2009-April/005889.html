Ok, I misunderstood the purpose here.

&gt;<i> jtag_add_pathmove() is at the level of your ARM concerns, and can be used

</I>
Yes, I too think pathmove used alone is safe. What seems to produce
varying results are (combinations of) the complex functions like
jtag_add_ir_scan.

Some context of the discussion got lost here because it went via PM.
If I understood &#216;yvind's conclusion correctly he thinks that the
reason why arm11 doesn't run on *some* jtag interfaces is because they
produce different intermediate states in these jtag_* calls.

I read between the lines that his conclusion was more pathmoves while
I would advocate for a jtag_* interface that produces
consistent/well-defined results on all hardware and *then* adding
pathmoves if they are still needed.

So my question would be: does anyone know if the drivers produce
different state transitions (except for idling on stable states) for
the jtag_* calls, including more complex stuff that involves
jtag_add_ir_scan etc. ?


Sorry for the thread hijack.


Michael
