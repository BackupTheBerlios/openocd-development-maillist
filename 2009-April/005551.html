<PRE>Zach,
There are a few things missing on your list which I think are important:

- Coldfire support (which is basically an enhanced 68000 core) would be
nice. There is no open source solution out there to program Coldfire
controllers which is a shame because the Coldfire controllers are
actually quite nice and reasonably priced. Freescale thinks their
customers should use Codewarrior or take their business somewhere else.
- Completing ARM Cortex A8 support.

I see CFI is on your list as well. I have a slightly improved version of
cfi.c which some speed enhancements. Shall I mail it to you to have a
look at it? I agree the cfi code is not very clean; a lot of code which
basically does the same is duplicated.  Also the bus width / chip width
handling is not fully implemented yet. IMHO vendor specific code could
be just a bunch of functions called through function pointers from
cfi.c.

I just hope people are not put off by the high frequency of changes
which causes their patches to fail. I think its best to concentrate on
one area at a time and finish it first before moving to another area.
This reduces the chance two (or more) people are working on the same
code.

</I>&gt;<i> Onderwerp: [Openocd-development] my tech proposal
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This message follows my sentiments about the human side of 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD with a more technically focused perspective.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First off: if you had conflicts that prevent a clean 'svn 
</I>&gt;<i> diff' patch, you should be able to copy your original 
</I>&gt;<i> pre-merged files (the .mine
</I>&gt;<i> files) into a fresh working copy of the older revision (along 
</I>&gt;<i> with changes to any other files that did merge okay) and 
</I>&gt;<i> extract the clean patch therein.  Let me know if this advice 
</I>&gt;<i> is not as helpful as I think it should be; if all else fails, 
</I>&gt;<i> send me your entire working copy and I will deal with the 
</I>&gt;<i> mess that I caused.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, here is my current list of outstanding tasks, where 
</I>&gt;<i> '+' items have a current patch and '-' items do not.  This is 
</I>&gt;<i> not a milestone task list; I am leaving that as someone 
</I>&gt;<i> else's responsibility.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * FT2232 driver:
</I>&gt;<i>   + integrate FTD2XX High-Speed Device Patch (Joern Kaipf + ZW)
</I>&gt;<i>   +? remove non-A types (Uwe Hermann) (does this patch still apply?)
</I>&gt;<i>   - fix segfault from long scan chains (observed by Dick Hollenbeck)
</I>&gt;<i>   - fix non-recoverability of cable connect/reconnect
</I>&gt;<i>   - cure buggy madness (others might try to break this into pieces)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * J-Link driver (w/ yellow hardware)
</I>&gt;<i>   - integrate Jeff and Duane's pending changes
</I>&gt;<i>   - cure buggy madness (this is my own poorly qualified TODO item)
</I>&gt;<i>   - test on known targets
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * MC1322x target support
</I>&gt;<i>   - integrate and test support from Jeff and Duane
</I>&gt;<i>   - get working with a known good interface (i.e. not today's jlink)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * TAP changes:
</I>&gt;<i>   - use tap_set_state everywhere to allow logging TAP state 
</I>&gt;<i> transitions
</I>&gt;<i>   - add new TAP state table provided by Jeff Williams
</I>&gt;<i>   - update tap_get_tms_path API as suggested by Duane Ellis
</I>&gt;<i>     - slow boat: add tap_get_tms_path2 and allow both for a while
</I>&gt;<i>     - convert drivers that use old API over to the new one
</I>&gt;<i>     - remove old tap_get_tms_path
</I>&gt;<i>   - other changes work picking out of Jeff/Duane's patches
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> * CFI:
</I>&gt;<i>   - factor vendor-specific code into separate source files
</I>&gt;<i>   - investigate adding new interface to those bits?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Architectural Upgrades
</I>&gt;<i>   - Allow N:M:P mapping of servers, targets, and interfaces
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * ARM:
</I>&gt;<i>   - better alignment with ARM technical documentation (Jeff W.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Miscellaneous:
</I>&gt;<i>   - continue to improve state and system debugging (Jeff W.)
</I>&gt;<i>   - overhaul use of types to improve 32/64-bit portability
</I>&gt;<i>   - factor drivers to improve re-use
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If I do not include something important to you, it was not 
</I>&gt;<i> intentional; simply follow-up with a your items and I will 
</I>&gt;<i> add them to the next version.  I am not interested in keep 
</I>&gt;<i> track of what goes in (the repo log does that), so I will 
</I>&gt;<i> simply drop items when that happens for them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I hope that -- by maintaining this list and posting it here 
</I>&gt;<i> -- everyone will take away the idea that I care about the 
</I>&gt;<i> project's architecture.
</I>&gt;<i> I seriously considered writing a competing implementation, 
</I>&gt;<i> because I _knew_ there would be this kind of resistance to change.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I see the potential massive changes that would benefit the 
</I>&gt;<i> system, such as the list item for OpenOCD to allow 
</I>&gt;<i> heterogeneous configurations of servers, targets, and 
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces (N:M:P).  Admittedly, this was suggested by others 
</I>&gt;<i> recently (though I can't find the exact thread at the 
</I>&gt;<i> moment), but it is the kind of task that I might find entertaining.
</I>&gt;<i> I see other potential in the code, but I still have not been 
</I>&gt;<i> able to get my head around the nature of everything needs to 
</I>&gt;<i> be done.  There a lot.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If I could afford to play in this sandbox at this level of 
</I>&gt;<i> intensity indefinitely, I could help make those visions real, 
</I>&gt;<i> but -- even if that was fiscally and physically feasible -- 
</I>&gt;<i> that process would take a lot of trust and courage on the 
</I>&gt;<i> part of the community.  Still, it doesn't matter who actually 
</I>&gt;<i> makes those changes; they will be painful, but the metaphor 
</I>&gt;<i> of surgery is apt.  We must cut to cure.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That will result in a slow-but-steady flow of incremental 
</I>&gt;<i> patches, which would add up to a lot of churn.  As I am but a 
</I>&gt;<i> babe in the woods around here, I will not presume to know 
</I>&gt;<i> what is best for this project, but I know a thing or two 
</I>&gt;<i> about what it takes to produce software.  If we want to reach 
</I>&gt;<i> for big goals, pain will be all but unavoidable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I present this plan in the hope it can ratified by the 
</I>&gt;<i> community to help us move forward on the same page.  Reaching 
</I>&gt;<i> a meaningful 1.0 will require commitment to making multitudes 
</I>&gt;<i> of the sort of changes that I have started.  Dealing with 
</I>&gt;<i> merging and conflicts is a necessary evil of working with 
</I>&gt;<i> open source; the only cure is to publish your patches first 
</I>&gt;<i> and get them into the tree.  I haven't had a conflict all week. ;) :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Zach
