<PRE>All,

I'm working on the patch that Jeff Williams did that updates the way the 
TMS path sequences work and have discovered an issue with the FT2232 driver.

Right now, I believe I can show that given the same sets of scan 
commands - the ft2232 driver does not follow the same tap sequence that 
other dongles follow.
I also see this with my cheap-usb-logic-analyzer.

I believe: Two dongles in theory, if given the same sets of commands, 
should generate the same basic tap state sequences.

To do otherwise is a bug.

I'd like some comments, second opinion, etc, ie: Am I correct? Or am I 
missing something?

====

The example place is: jtag_init_inner() - which is called when OpenOCD 
first starts up.

Which:
(a) calls jtag_add_tlr()  [putting all taps in reset]
(b) calls jtag_examine_chain()
(c) then calls jtag_validate_chain()

When jtag_examine_chain() runs, it basically does a DRSCAN of (N*32) 
bits to look for TAP IDs.

====

If you compare the generated wave forms and thus the TAP sequence the 
JLINK driver uses - vrs the FT2232 sequence, they are different.

I believe what follows is the reason.

====

For JLINK see: jlink.c - line 417, function jlink_scan(), which does this:
    (a) if needed move to the IR-SHIFT or DR-SHIFT state (line: 427)
    (b) Calls jlink_tap_append_scan() - which always leaves the tap in 
&quot;exit1-ir/dr&quot;
    (c) The last step @ line 639 transitions to exit1-IR/DR
    (d) Then always transitions to the ir/dr-pause state (line: 434)

Hence, all jlink IR/DR scans *always* exit via:  SHIFT -&gt; EXIT1 -&gt; PAUSE.
The &quot;bitbang&quot; (parallel ports) seem to do the same as jlink.
I believe others do the same thing.

====

In contrast, the FT2232 driver does something different.
    (a) switch() statement @ line 1452 - does an &quot;absurd&quot; check.
         ie: If the current scan is &gt; 128K bytes long...
    (b) line 1484 - calls ft2232_add_scan() - which
    (c) line 600 - moves to IR/DR shift if needed.
    (d) line 623 - loops - over large shift sequences
    (e) line 673 - deals with the trailing bits.
And at this point - it is different, it only occurs if the transition is 
to another state
    (f)  At line ft2232.c line 737 - is the issue.
       The last else{} in the file - calls tap_get_tms_path()
       That function returns the TMS sequence to the next state.
        In this case, it is to RESET, which is 0x7F

Hence, it is different.
For example - if it was an IR shift, path is IR-SHIFT -&gt; EXIT1 -&gt; 
UPDATE-IR without traversing PAUSE-IR, or EXIT2-IR

But it is also different if it was to goto another state, ie: SHIFT-IR 
to SHIFT-DR ...

====

Interestingly, the TMS paths - happens to be the same.

ie: If the traversal was:  shift-ir -&gt; move to shift-dir ...

The ft2232 would then generate the TMS sequence
    1 -&gt; exit1-ir
    1 -&gt; update-ir
    1 -&gt; select-dr
    0 -&gt; capture-dr
    0 -&gt; shift-dr

While the jlink (and other bit-bangers) would follow a different path:
    Remember: JLINK always ends in PAUSE-IR/DR
    thus in this example we are at PAUSE-IR
    1 -&gt; exit2-ir
    1 -&gt; update-ir
    1 -&gt; select-dr
    0 -&gt; capture-dr
    0 -&gt;shift-dr

An identical 'tms' sequence - however - by completely different state path.

====

I believe this also relates to [ GRR - openocd mailing list archive is 
down right now ... can't make a link right now]

See mail from: Dirk Behme - 3/1/2009 - Subject: RE [Openocd-development] 
OMAP3-Jtag

dirk&gt; Most probably the issue is with this TMS manipulation

dirk&gt; BUFFER_ADD = tap_get_tms_path( tap_get_state(), tap_get_end_state() ) | (last_bit &lt;&lt; 7);

dirk&gt; in ft2232.c which most probably only works if always 7 clocks 
dirk&gt; are done for each state change (?). And this isn't the case 
dirk&gt; any more with improved ap_get_tms_path() from Holger.
