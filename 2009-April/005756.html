I tried building OpenOCD with all of these extra options.  Adding them
all causes countless warnings on the r1521 tree.  After that, I went
through them one-by-one, trying to isolate the good from the bad.

&gt;<i> -std=gnu99 (accept modern code)
</I>&gt;<i> -D_GNU_SOURCE (satisfy Stallman's ego)
</I>
Seems redundant with -std=gnu99, but suitable with -std=c99.

&gt;<i> -O2, -O3, or -Os (required for some warnings!)
</I>
We have -O2 by default.  Can be overridden during configure.

&gt;<i> -Wl,-warn-common (warn about UNIX-only C feature)
</I>&gt;<i> -fno-common (block that UNIX-only C feature)
</I>
No comment, uncertain of the value.

&gt;<i> -ffast-math (allow algebraic simplification)
</I>
Not worth the risks.

&gt;<i> -Wall (most useful warnings)
</I>
Present.

&gt;<i> -W (more useful warnings)
</I>
Redundant?  Can be added.

&gt;<i> -Wshadow (shadowing confuses people: bugs)
</I>
Good, but impossible for now.

&gt;<i> -Wcast-align (not portable)
</I>
Good.  Can be added.

&gt;<i> -Wredundant-decls (find missing header protection)
</I>
Good.  I have some patches to fix the problems that this exposes.

&gt;<i> -Wbad-function-cast
</I>
Seems good.  Can be added.

&gt;<i> -Wcast-qual
</I>
Maybe, but appears problematic.  Try adding it.

&gt;<i> -Waggregate-return (code may be slow)
</I>
Nice, but sometimes unavoidable.  No thanks.

&gt;<i> -Wstrict-prototypes (very important for quality C)
</I>
Present.

&gt;<i> -Wmissing-prototypes (very important for quality C)
</I>
Maybe, but it does not look possible without a bit of work.

&gt;<i> If not debugging:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -s (make executable file smaller)
</I>&gt;<i> -fomit-frame-pointer (make code smaller and faster)
</I>
These are options that individuals creating binary packages may chose to
enable for their particular distribution, at the expense of taking the
support burden on themselves.  The community cannot support users that
use these flags, so they should never become default options.

&gt;<i> If debugging:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -g3 (the &quot;3&quot; gets you line info)
</I>
In this vein, I would suggest -ggdb, but I do not know what that buys.

&gt;<i> If you truly must support ancient compilers:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -Wdeclaration-after-statement (ouch)
</I>
No thanks.  With talk about -std=c99, this would be retrogressive.

&gt;<i> If the compiler accepts the option:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -Wstrict-aliasing (catch horrible bugs)
</I>
Good, but appears to come with -Wall.  Can be added.

Thanks for providing these suggestions; while I may not have liked them
in their entirety, their spirit aligns with the prevention errors.

We should develop patches to fix at least those issues indicated, but
the patches need to be separated into a series that touch small groups
of files and fix one warning at a time.  I am not certain whether or not
all of these warnings deserve to be fixed.  It's a fine line to walk.

Personally, I would like to see OpenOCD pass with -Wbad-function-cast,
-Wcast-align, -Wredundant-decls, and -Wshadow.  The last will be a
difficult task (and may not be worth doing until the underlying code
needs rewriting), but the others are low-hanging fruit and worth adding.

Patches should following shortly.

Cheers,

Zach
