<PRE>Hi

This is guesswork since I have no hardware to test but ..

I have been looking at old patches from Jeff, and at the current  JLink 
code. The problems  with processor faults that Jeff reports and fixes by 
scanning out a nop indicates that the processor executes  extra tdi bus 
data as opcodes. The way to do this in ARM7 is to run an RTI transition. 
So lets assume that the JLink code issues extra RTI transitions.

Looking at the code in jlink_tap_execute:

 /* Pad and send a tap sequence to the device, and receive the answer.
 * For the purpose of padding we assume that we are in idle or pause 
state. */
static int jlink_tap_execute(void)
.
.
.
    /* Pad last byte so that tap_length is divisible by 8 */
    while (tap_length % 8 != 0)
    {
        /* More of the last TMS value keeps us in the same state,
         * analogous to free-running JTAG interfaces. */
        jlink_tap_append_step(last_tms, 0);
    }


 From what I understand for ARM7 target we should NEVER pad extra RTI 
transitions, and also from the JLink TRM it is not necessary to pad tap 
transitions to multiples of 8 ( I might be wrong,  but looking at the 
documentation for EMU_CMD_HW_JTAG3 suggests this ).

So, do we have state transitions ending in RTI that the gets padded with 
extra RTI transitions ?

Does the removal adding transitions up to mulktiples of 8 break more 
than it helps?

Just my 2&#246;re as we say

Regards,
Magnus
