I just wanted to report that I am having success with this patch,
which is great because I haven't had much luck with the others. 

I'm using a black segger jlink on my own mc1322x hardware.

I'm using jeffw's config file, but I have to have

   jtag_khz 2

instead of 

   jtag_khz 0

I also have to have code already flashed on the part (using
Freescale's test tool). I'm testing with my rftest-tx program. 

I haven't used openocd much so I'm not entirely sure what to be
looking for, of if I'm using the commands right, but here is my brief
report:

  reset doesn't seem to work

  halt works

  after halt, stepping seems to work fine

  breakpoints don't seem to work

memory reads look good (with jeff's patches against r1409 I could read
the memory but it always used addr 0 as the base, so mdw 0 and mdw
0x00400000 would read the same location, now though they are reading
correctly)

Anyway, thats it for now,

-Mar.
