</I>&gt;<i> Clarity isn't just about simple-looking code. It's also about

</I>&gt;<i> Hiding all that behind some operator overload would serve
</I>&gt;<i> to obfuscate what is going on. Of course there is a need
</I>&gt;<i> for balance here; the common things are in fact dealt with
</I>&gt;<i> in Linux code via macros and inline functions.
</I>
The example was what should have been a member function. There is zero
performance loss by what is essentially renaming &quot;rq&quot; to &quot;this&quot;.

I can't follow your clarity argument here, rewriting a member function
to be a static function doesn't add clarity IMO.


&gt;&gt;<i> Also I am not aware of much use of class inheritance in Linux beyond
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simple virtual function tables. To simulate this feature in OpenOCD
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there are files where nearly every other function starts with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something like this:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;armv4_5_common_t *armv4_5 = target-&gt;arch_info;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;arm7_9_common_t *arm7_9 = armv4_5-&gt;arch_info;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;arm7tdmi_common_t *arm7tdmi = arm7_9-&gt;arch_info;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;arm720t_common_t *arm720t = arm7tdmi-&gt;arch_info;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This complete block would just disappear in C++ and with it all the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> potential for typing errors that comes with this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Linux kernel code would fill in defaults. For example, you can ask
</I>&gt;<i> for a struct inode. Some stuff is already filled in when you get it.
</I>&gt;<i> This could well be in code that provides a particular type of struct
</I>&gt;<i> inode to other code, filling in defaults appropriate for a block device
</I>&gt;<i> inode. So a scsi driver asks for a block device inode, which in turn
</I>&gt;<i> asks for a generic inode. It works nicely.
</I>
It works nicely in OpenOCD too, if you are careful and don't mind
bloated code or have tons of proprietary macros that simulate the
well-documented behavior of C++.

In fact it would also work nicely if one wrote OpenOCD in assembler.


&gt;&gt;<i> C++ brings simple safety measures like strong typing,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> C has this unless you ignore warnings.
</I>
The C++ imitation involves endless amounts of (explicit) unsafe casts.
Like in the example above. There is no way around that although macros
can help avoiding simple typing errors.

&gt;&gt;<i> function name mangling
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So you can make a mystery out of which function
</I>&gt;<i> is actually getting called. :-)
</I>
Benefiting from name mangling does not imply that people (have to) use
polymorphism.

I am surprised you didn't refer to the option to enforce function
prototypes as a substitute...

&gt;&gt;<i> In addition C++ code when run through a documentation tool like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doxygen will show the actual class structure unlike the code that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simulates that in C and it avoids fluff like the arch_info fields
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> above that distract from the actual classes. Such a documentation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be especially beneficial for a project that wants to attract
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> newcomers as contributors who implement small tasks/drivers and who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need to see quickly what are the essential interfaces that affect
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their task.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hidden magic isn't so good for newcomers either. Currently you
</I>&gt;<i> can like at an assignment and know what it does. There isn't much
</I>&gt;<i> chance that x=y is opening database connections or worse.
</I>
I wasn't talking about hidden magic at all. arch_info is a pointer to
subclass specific data which is unnecessary in C++ were such data is
stored locally in the derived class.

I was talking about changing the code that currently simulates C++
into real C++. Using operator overloading is way beyond that and if it
is such an obstacle it can be discouraged in the coding standards.

I'll take all the pet C++ features over all the pet
macro-based-simulations of pet C++ features any day.

Reading these comments one begins to think that the cyberspace must be
littered with the rotting corpses of open source projects who dared to
go near C++.
