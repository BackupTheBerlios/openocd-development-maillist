Ok, I checked that. It seems, to have predictable behavior the complex
operations should end with the pause state and everything else should
be done via pathmove.

I don't have time immediately to rewrite that since the modified
algorithms need checking.

</I>
I thought the logging idea is helpful, but it seems in the end the
arm11 driver needs a general re-write as I would rather not have to
worry about non-deterministic behavior of the JTAG interface driver at
all. And the way to guarantee that is via the pathmove-for-everything
approach.
