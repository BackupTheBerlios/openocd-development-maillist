<PRE>Jeff Williams a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> If MC1322x standard then good luck getting it to work.  Trust me, this  
</I>&gt;<i> is not a trivial matter.  It took me almost a month to figure it out,  
</I>&gt;<i> and this is after smart, seasoned people had already broken their  
</I>&gt;<i> picks on it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But there's no point in debating - the fact is that increased  
</I>&gt;<i> efficiency, support for a new IC, stability improvements to JLink,  
</I>&gt;<i> better alignment with ARM technical documentation, and a significant  
</I>&gt;<i> upgrade to state and system debugging are now all in pieces, and there  
</I>&gt;<i> is no resource to recover it.  Those changes, a month's work, are lost  
</I>&gt;<i> for good.  What's to debate?  The group decided they didn't like/want  
</I>&gt;<i> my contribution, and now I'm moving on.  I don't need to be convinced  
</I>&gt;<i> that it was a good choice, because it's immaterial.  To my mind there  
</I>&gt;<i> were at least 10 different ways to manage this, but fundamentally the  
</I>&gt;<i> group is happy with the status quo and I regret having wasted my time.

</I>We all appreciate your contributions and I don't believe that anyone in
the group is trying to sabotage your work.
As suggested before you should test with what you got and things will
get worked out. From what I have seen so far the changes made are done
to clean up messy code. If I would provide code that generates that many
warnings at my work I would get fired. The point with on warnings is
that you
should not ignore warning and try to write clean code. Sometimes you may
think that a warning is just that and one day that warning kills your
application.

As for J-Link I am sorry to announce it to you but it has never worked
well enough to be acceptable in any way for real work. Good people are
working
hard to get it fixed, just be patient.
