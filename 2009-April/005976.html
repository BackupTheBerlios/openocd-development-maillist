Nope.

First of all, you could remove them in plain C. (via memcpy,
struct assignment, macros, or inline functions) There are
reasons why this wasn't done: clarity and performance.

Performance here is about only copying the stuff that
truly needs to be copied in **this** location.

Clarity isn't just about simple-looking code. It's also about
code that is very visible and no-nonsense in operation.
Hiding all that behind some operator overload would serve
to obfuscate what is going on. Of course there is a need
for balance here; the common things are in fact dealt with
in Linux code via macros and inline functions.

&gt;<i> Also I am not aware of much use of class inheritance in Linux beyond
</I>&gt;<i> simple virtual function tables. To simulate this feature in OpenOCD
</I>&gt;<i> there are files where nearly every other function starts with
</I>&gt;<i> something like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        armv4_5_common_t *armv4_5 = target-&gt;arch_info;
</I>&gt;<i>        arm7_9_common_t *arm7_9 = armv4_5-&gt;arch_info;
</I>&gt;<i>        arm7tdmi_common_t *arm7tdmi = arm7_9-&gt;arch_info;
</I>&gt;<i>        arm720t_common_t *arm720t = arm7tdmi-&gt;arch_info;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This complete block would just disappear in C++ and with it all the
</I>&gt;<i> potential for typing errors that comes with this.
</I>
Linux kernel code would fill in defaults. For example, you can ask
for a struct inode. Some stuff is already filled in when you get it.
This could well be in code that provides a particular type of struct
inode to other code, filling in defaults appropriate for a block device
inode. So a scsi driver asks for a block device inode, which in turn
asks for a generic inode. It works nicely.

&gt;<i> C++ brings simple safety measures like strong typing,
</I>
C has this unless you ignore warnings.

&gt;<i> function name mangling
</I>
So you can make a mystery out of which function
is actually getting called. :-)

&gt;<i> In addition C++ code when run through a documentation tool like
</I>&gt;<i> doxygen will show the actual class structure unlike the code that
</I>&gt;<i> simulates that in C and it avoids fluff like the arch_info fields
</I>&gt;<i> above that distract from the actual classes. Such a documentation
</I>&gt;<i> would be especially beneficial for a project that wants to attract
</I>&gt;<i> newcomers as contributors who implement small tasks/drivers and who
</I>&gt;<i> need to see quickly what are the essential interfaces that affect
</I>&gt;<i> their task.
</I>
Hidden magic isn't so good for newcomers either. Currently you
can like at an assignment and know what it does. There isn't much
chance that x=y is opening database connections or worse.
