boolean success/failure doesn't really give the programmer a chance to  
decide what to do.  I agree that the usage of return codes in OpenOCD  
today is a mess, but careful use of well-defined error codes means  
that a lot of &quot;log a message and die&quot; conditions today would become  
handled internally or would be repackaged with a more meaningful error  
at a higher level.

I've just spent 2 years defining a fairly large API entirely in C for  
a new problem space.  After a few false starts, we have managed to  
design an error system that conveys meaningful error codes to the  
programmer but also provides ways to map those errors to user-friendly  
strings that can be presented to the user.  All internal errors are  
mapped onto the same error code space as external errors, but they are  
handled in a appropriate manner when possible rather than just blindly  
returning them to the next layer up.  This allows the code when to  
decide to do recovery versus failure.

&gt;<i> Why should information about what went wrong be limited to 32 bits of
</I>&gt;<i> information?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It doesn't strictly need to be.  For example, the API I reference  
above returns a 32-bit error code but also takes an optional value- 
return parameter that provides domain-specific error information.   
These additional parameters can also be stacked so nested failures can  
be communicated.  This ultimately provides a richer and more friendly  
error system for both the developer as well as the end user of a tool  
using the API.  The return codes are for programmatic handling while  
the additional parameter is for communicating errors to users.

&gt;<i> A c++, java or tcl exception can contain a heck of a lot more useful
</I>&gt;<i> information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
And can also cause a lot more problems.  Having a deeply nested  
function throw an exception can cause the upper layers to get in all  
sorts of weird states.  Every layer needs to be aware of what  
exceptions can be thrown by what functions so that appropriate cleanup  
can be done.  You may as well just return a return code.
