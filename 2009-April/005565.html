If someone has Coldfire hardware, I bet the community would be willing
to work with them to get it going, but it would be a lot of work.
However, that gets me wondering of opportunities to wrangle up some kind
of sponsorship for the bootstrapping phase (e.g. Google Summer of Code).
Food for communal thought.

Thanks!  Since I do not have CFI hardware on hand, I must leave it up to
others to review and either commit or provide feedback, but I will keep
this topic on my radar.

Cheers,

Zach
