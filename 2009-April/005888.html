</I>I want your work to be accepted !!!!! Now !!! I like it :) We also get 
an interface where access to paths are through function calls, not array 
lookups, excellent.

The we test it on all target and interface hardware.

Then we can without breaking anything add the possibility to use the 
same framework to look up other paths, if that is needed for specific 
tagets or interfaces.

Best regards,
Magnus
