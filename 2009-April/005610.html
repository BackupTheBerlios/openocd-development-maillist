Functional unit testing could be a start.  We could exercise a ton of
code without ever needing to talk to the hardware.  That was what I was
thinking when I added the items to The List.

A device like you describe could definitely be used for deeper testing,
and it's not a particularly bad idea.  I have been meaning to get into
synthesizing my own FPGAs, and this sounds like a fairly easy and useful
starter project.  It is now on The List as well, unless you are now
going to tell me why my child-like ignorance has led me astray.

You may have well just tempted me with Pandora's box.  I must know more.

Cheers,

Zach
