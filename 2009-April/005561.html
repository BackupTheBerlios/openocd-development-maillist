</I>
Can't I simply claim that it's on The List? ;)   I definitely agree that
I should be providing the revision number, but I have evolved the idea
that TODO files inside repositories get treated the same way as other
files do: people fear change.  They become monumental testimonies to the
good intentions of the ambitious.  I know; I've written my fair share.

Instead, I am hoping that it can serve more to guide contributors into
regular project management discussions.  Patches would hide all but the
latest activity, and I want people to be reminded and energized by the
web of goals that lurk behind the daily grind.  The List will give a
complete picture of the activities reported and pending; it only needs
be reposted after sufficient changes have taken place.

Ideally, folks will start to volunteer to cherry-pick tasks off of it.
I think we will see more of that if it gets posted regularly; it should
clearly be a fresh artifact and contain items that we really intend to
carry forward.  Since I am volunteering to take on this challenge of
trying to herd cats in this manner, I hope the community is willing to
embrace this idea for a time (or give me a better alternative).

Project management can be tricky.  I am still trying to get it right,
and -- though I may screw up often -- I hope my effort is appreciated.
In that vein, thanks to you and all others that have been supportive.
I live, I learn, and I try to improve.

&gt;<i> W.r.t. churn, I think it would be helpful, as you do, to try to get
</I>&gt;<i> a lot of those &quot;warning fixes&quot; out of the way so that at least the
</I>&gt;<i> overall codebase is a bit more stable and then hopefully the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;churn&quot; is localized to a set of files at any one time.
</I>
I think that we have passed the &quot;warning fixes&quot; stage at this point,
with -Werror surviving intact.  I might be wrong and some corner cases
remain to be reported, but I believe the community has chimed in on the
problems for all of the major ones.  Fixes are in tree for all of them,
as far as I am aware.  [[New bugs are another thing, as the recent post
from Andy Chenee shows.  Sorry about that one.]]

At this point, the use of -Werror will keep us from having to go through
that particular flavor of pain again, so things should only get better.

&gt;<i> &gt; * Architectural Upgrades
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - Allow N:M:P mapping of servers, targets, and interfaces
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - About CFI:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to see if the ecosflash driver could not be used to take
</I>&gt;<i> a CFI driver from e.g. eCos and use that in OpenOCD. The
</I>&gt;<i> current OpenOCD CFI driver is fine, such as it is, but e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> eCos CFI drivers are getting a *LOT* of testing from a much
</I>&gt;<i> bigger community.
</I>
Added, though you will need to check that I interpreted you correctly.

&gt;<i> - New targets?
</I>
Any that you have in mind?  Coldfire and Cortex are on thanks to Nico.
MC1322x from Jeff.  I have added an &quot;insert your target here&quot; item.

Cheers,

Zach
