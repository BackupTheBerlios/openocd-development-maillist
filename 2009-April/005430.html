Well, since this needs to be done for each driver, I think it could be a 
matter of getting a reference implementation in place, then the other 
drivers would have to sprinkle in the calls to tap_set_state() as 
needed.  But there may be some jtag***() functions where this can be 
done in a common way, like the path move, etc.  It will have to be 
looked into.

</I>I never posted it.  When the SVF and XSVF functions call the jtag 
routines, they can push those underlying jtag routines in directions 
that they don't normally travel.  There was a case where if a bitcount 
exceeded some number, then ft2232.c would seg fault.  I know where the 
bug is, and have been planning on dealing with it.  That limit is not 
normally hit with the bulk of the code in OpenOCD.  A hint as to the fix 
to the problem is in my add_clocks function ft2232.c.  The overflow 
condition has to be checked for *within* the loop, basically.  I'm not 
staring at the code now, but that's what I remember.
