Yes. I considered this and started to do such an analysis on a
method-by-method basis, but most redundant declarations that I found in
both .c and .h files were used externally.  I started to assume and got
predictable results.  I have attached a patch that puts that .c file
declaration back and removes the one from the .h file.

I have been planning to go over the target directory and add the static
keywords.  The duplicate definitions induced procrastination, and this
patch will now make that step less ornery.

&gt;<i> Personally, the declaration of everything local as static is at the very 
</I>&gt;<i> bottom of the list.  I fail to see the quality gains and I do see the 
</I>&gt;<i> problems when moving stuff around, and it kills the linker map files !!

By using the static keyword, the compiler may choose to inline small
functions and those that are called once in a source file.  Without that
keyword, such transformation cannot take place (as the object may be
later required for linking... who knows).  The code will end up making
function calls that could have been optimized away.

Furthermore, the static keyword is one of the only ways to clearly
indicate those routines that are public and private in a file; without
them, every variable and function is be exposed in the object file,
allowing layering violations and practically guaranteeing bloat.
It also makes it impossible for new developers to determine whether a
function is used locally or globally, without digging into the code.

The benefits of the static keyword largely outweigh its costs, but one
can temporarily remove the static keyword in certain modules while
debugging by adding &quot;#define static&quot;.  That removes the keyword at the
preprocessor level from that point forward in the compilation.
I believe one may also use the -fno-inline-small-functions and
-fno-inline-functions-called-once options (enabled at -O2 and -O
respectively) to affect similar effects with the debugger.

&gt;<i> Getting everything compiled with the most severe compiler enforced error 
</I>&gt;<i> detection will not detect the errors  that actually makes OpenOCD less 
</I>&gt;<i> useful than it could be. It will, and it already has, help us clean up

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Keep balanced focus, please.
</I>
I think my initial reply that precipitated this patch was balanced;
there are some warnings that fix problems and others that do not.
These last statements suggest that this patch (or their inspiration)
will hurt the project or that it lacked proper consideration.

This patch fixes real duplicate declarations; I made a minor mistake
that would have been caught in a later patch that adds static keywords
to the source files in the target directory.  This patch reduces noise
and allows the new warning to be added, preventing future duplicate
declarations from ever reaching the tree.

The static keyword patches add legitimately missing C language keywords
and allow the compiler to apply additional optimizations that would
allow subsequent passes to improve code size or performance of those
methods and their caller(s).  They also improve the readability of the
code by giving developers a clear indication of data/code scope.

These efforts seem both reasoned and sound to me, so I hope the attached
patch suffices pending further cleanup.   I believe this and the other
warnings buy us useful protections during development and maintenance.
The warnings I am asking to add enforce good coding practices; while we
can write code without them, I believe that everyone should be using
them to help ensure the contribution of rigorously checked patches.

Cheers,

Zach
