I had forgotten about that #pragma for some time, but I know it was for
the reason that you just gave.

I use vim but without any code-folding or other visual tricks; I end up
visually scanning up and down through files.  Full-width markers are
critical for me to do that quickly, as I tend to use them against the
overall pattern of the code above and below them (without having to read
the code itself).  

I prefer '=' because it proves a little more substance than '-', and the
patch shows that I use two of them where you want only one.  I will only
use them after every function when each one spans more than 40-50 lines
or so (which to me is exceptionally long), otherwise I use a single line
to de-mark logical sub-groups more or less at the same interval.

Since I am about to spend a lot of time in that module, it was just a
last little touch to make myself completely at home in that module.
While it would be nice, it's obviously not on my critical patch. :)

Cheers,

Zach
