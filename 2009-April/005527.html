<PRE>It was handled badly.  When Duane threw in the towel there should have  
been some discussion before you guys went ape with churn.  Duane -  
thank you for your help.  And to the other MC1322x guys - I'm sorry  
that I'm letting you down, but it's not a workable situation for us at  
the moment.  Too much investment in the status quo, and frankly, too  
much swagger.  The community made a decision, and on reflection I see  
that this is not a place where I can make useful progress with my  
limited time and resources.

Honestly, IAR+JLink works, and dealing with it's bugs and headaches is  
less effort for me.  Let's move on guys- learn to live with your  
decisions (and I'll learn to live with mine).

El Apr 21, 2009, a las 18:36 , Zach Welch escribi&#243;:

&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here are some of my thoughts about some of the issues raised today.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Normally, I try to refrain from allowing myself to write this...  
</I>&gt;<i> openly,
</I>&gt;<i> but recent events compel me to try and address the problems head on.
</I>&gt;<i> I tried to make the main points summarize my position, but nothing
</I>&gt;<i> herein was composed or edited before today.  It's probably a bit  
</I>&gt;<i> rough.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 0) I seem to have this effect on open-source communities.  Nuts. :(
</I>&gt;<i> 0a) I am truly sorry for any resulting noise or confusion,  
</I>&gt;<i> particularly
</I>&gt;<i> that I am about to cause by any of the following items.
</I>&gt;<i> 0b) Brace yourself; it's not over.  I could ride OpenOCD past v2.0...
</I>&gt;<i> 0c) ...unless I am driven off.  It wouldn't be the first time. ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Post patches to the list or send them to me.  I can deal with them.
</I>&gt;<i> 1a) Nothing will be lost, unless _you_ chose for it to be that way.
</I>&gt;<i> 1b) I have fixed bit-rotten 1.5MB+ patches.  Nothing here scares me.
</I>&gt;<i> 1c) I do not need anyone with such outstanding work to 'svn up' first.
</I>&gt;<i> 1d) Otherwise, hang on for my next message; I'll give instructions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) I waited two weeks.  Patiently.  Where were these so-called  
</I>&gt;<i> patches?
</I>&gt;<i> 2a) My patience ended at the end of last week, and I started patching.
</I>&gt;<i> 2b) I only ask for a measure of the same in return.  I will help fix  
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;<i> 2c) This is not criticism of others; I am simply stating The Way It  
</I>&gt;<i> Was.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) I broke my patches into parts that would be easy to review and  
</I>&gt;<i> merge.
</I>&gt;<i> 3a) Subversion has merge functions par excellence.  Learn to love  
</I>&gt;<i> them.
</I>&gt;<i> 3b) That said, I know it can suck to repeatedly deal with the process.
</I>&gt;<i> 3c) Try keeping up with the Linux kernel.  Seriously, this is nothing.
</I>&gt;<i> 3d) The solution to avoid this is simple: send in your patches first!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) I will not apologize for fixing real problems with the code.
</I>&gt;<i> 4a) My changes seek to raise the standard of quality for the project.
</I>&gt;<i> 4b) I do beg for forgiveness over anything I actually broke (see 2b).
</I>&gt;<i> 4c) I have offered and stepped up to try to fix things that I break.
</I>&gt;<i> 4d) If anything got broken by my changes to date (and were not a  
</I>&gt;<i> trivial
</I>&gt;<i> typo/lapse), the code was probably fragile and needed to be revisited.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5) I only move forward, never backward; read the specs, grok the code.
</I>&gt;<i> 5a) These changes _are_ moving things forward, if through discussion.
</I>&gt;<i> 5b) The J-Link driver will be fixed with this push, either by myself  
</I>&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i> others that are activity considering the now fresh and clean code.
</I>&gt;<i> 5c) I will help ensure that others' changes keep moving forward too.
</I>&gt;<i> 5d) I believe my reposting the FTD2XX high-speed patch attests to  
</I>&gt;<i> that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 6) I will not endorse locking the repository, not even advisory.
</I>&gt;<i> 6a) That actually eliminates the pressure to push patches to the tree.
</I>&gt;<i> 6b) Locks make it virtually impossible to perform systematic tree-wide
</I>&gt;<i> maintenance without taking locks on every file (serializing the  
</I>&gt;<i> group).
</I>&gt;<i> 6c) This policy kept me from contributing anything for almost two  
</I>&gt;<i> weeks,
</I>&gt;<i> as I waited for others to finish their work and &quot;unlock&quot; the tree.
</I>&gt;<i> 6d) How would they be doled out?  Round-robin?  How many others will  
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> bother to stick to waiting to see if they get a chance at the locks?
</I>&gt;<i> 6e) J-Link might be working by now, if the group had started accepting
</I>&gt;<i> my patches and made others with work-in-progress deal with the merges.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 7) This is nothing personal; I know it's hard not to take it that way.
</I>&gt;<i> 7a) I am volunteering my time and services; I want this to be fun.
</I>&gt;<i> 7b) Please hang in there for a while longer; I'll try to make it good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 8) I have wasted man-months of my life dealing with these problems...
</I>&gt;<i> 8a) ...in each of the many different groups with which I try to work.
</I>&gt;<i> 8b) It somewhat appears to be my lot in life to do so.  So it shall  
</I>&gt;<i> be.
</I>&gt;<i> 8c) I try to win/lose these battles with my sharply written points...
</I>&gt;<i> 8d) ...even if they factor directly into why I find myself in word- 
</I>&gt;<i> wars.
</I>&gt;<i> 8e) You'd almost think that I enjoy to write; I truly prefer to code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope that I have covered most of the points raised today, and I am
</I>&gt;<i> eager to now return my focus to more technical matters.  Next, I will
</I>&gt;<i> send a revised list of tasks that I know are outstanding in the  
</I>&gt;<i> project,
</I>&gt;<i> in the hope that it will further help us address this situation fully.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sincerely,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Zach Welch
</I>&gt;<i> Corvallis, OR
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. I have this sneaking sensation that this may be one of those
</I>&gt;<i> e-mails I live to regret, but I would regret not sending it even more.
