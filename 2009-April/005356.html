find_package() I believe is C++ code within CMake.  We call it from 
src/CmakeModules/*.cmake.

The two <A HREF="http://">http://</A> links I sent you fully describe the &quot;problem&quot; and why it 
has not been fixed.  The second <A HREF="http://">http://</A> link clearly shows that Windows 
is holding back a solution.

But the first link shows another way on how to solve your problem on a 
UNIX like platform, that is, to have the *.a file override the *.so file.


As to your most recent problem:


When the libusb.so file is linked, it would have the same potential for 
the problem you are seeing.  I would suggest that you look into how 
libusb.so is being linked on your platform, and include whatever library 
is being added to that link, also into your link, statically or 
dynamically. 


If it is elf format, libusb.so may tell you what it needed during link 
time, perhaps with tools readelf or nm.  Or you can download the source 
to libusb and find out what it needs.

I don't remember readelf or nm off the top of my head.


If you copy the command output from make, you can paste it onto your 
command line and experiment interactively with the up arrow until you 
get it right, then work backwards into the CMake script.  

Realize that your current problem is not one with CMake but with libusb, 
and that mailing list is now a better source of information.
