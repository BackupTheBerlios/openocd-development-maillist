I think we can all understand and sympathize with this sentiment, but
thanks for reporting in with the news.  While I hope you will follow the
progress and chip in what you can, it's smart to pass the torch if your
fuel supply is sporadic.  I expect you can continue to contribute to the
discussion, even if you can't find time to sling more code yourself.

I would like to try and get the pieces flowing into the repository, but
I do not have any FT2232-based hardware to test.  I will leave those
bits for Dick or others to manage.

I have started to put together a small list of tasks in this area, based
on all of the progress and feedback that has been going through the
list.  I will post it shortly for everyone to consider.

Cheers,

Zach
