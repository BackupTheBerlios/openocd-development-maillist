These will appear in the next revision of my list.  I have been thinking
about what I want my next &quot;hobby&quot; board to be, and the Cortex A8 has
been one possible choice.  [[I am now hoping a board vendor reads this,
recognizes their opportunity, and drops one in the mail to me. ;) ]]

How much of the Coldfire support would need to be reverse-engineered?
With specifications and hardware, half of the battle will have already
been won, but the lack of an open source solution makes me guess
unencumbered references are unavailable.  Posting links to references
would help plant seed for others to pick this up and run with it.

&gt;<i> I see CFI is on your list as well. I have a slightly improved version of
</I>&gt;<i> cfi.c which some speed enhancements. Shall I mail it to you to have a
</I>&gt;<i> look at it? I agree the cfi code is not very clean; a lot of code which

</I>&gt;<i> be just a bunch of functions called through function pointers from
</I>&gt;<i> cfi.c.
</I>
Post code to the list, but we are on the same wavelength.  Completely.

&gt;<i> I just hope people are not put off by the high frequency of changes
</I>&gt;<i> which causes their patches to fail. I think its best to concentrate on
</I>&gt;<i> one area at a time and finish it first before moving to another area.
</I>&gt;<i> This reduces the chance two (or more) people are working on the same

</I>
Thanks for this feedback.  I do recognize that some of my recent
widespread changes have impacted just about everyone, but there will be
fewer of those as I begin to refocus on my current goals.  Except for
the static keywording, all of my widespread changes were driven to
eliminate warnings, and that was not entirely without consequences.

Still, I see potential to do minor clean-up to the high-level API (i.e.
server, jtag, and flash), so those patches will be appearing someday
(unless someone beats me to them).  At the moment, those fall entirely
under the scope of &quot;type system fixes&quot;, but there seems to be other
opportunities to change things for the better.

Cheers,

Zach
