<PRE>I haven't had a lot of time recently to work on reported problems (or  
had room to get out my test equipment), but as things are starting to  
quiet down in my personal life, I'd like to start planning for a 0.2.0  
release.  Lots of things have changed, so it is definitely time to do  
another release, but I want to make sure we have a good point to cut  
the release from HEAD.  From watching the list (I actually do read all  
those emails even if I don't have time to respond), it looks like the  
following major projects are in progress:

- Changing JTAG state transitions to use shortest path rather than 7  
clocks
- Fixing all the drivers that assumed 7 clocks per transition
- Cortex-A8 support

The first 2 seem to have good progress being made while the 3rd has  
had some initial discovery but no real development.  Would it be  
reasonable to start a 0.2 branch after the first 2 items are  
resolved?  Are there other major items that I missed?

&quot;He said he hadn't had a byte in three days. I had a short, so I split  
it with him.&quot;
