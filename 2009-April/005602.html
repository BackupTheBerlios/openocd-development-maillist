<PRE>&gt;<i> If AVR programming support comes to exists in OpenOCD, someone might
</I>&gt;<i> then be motivated to find a way to then support the debugging protocol.
</I>To add these support is not difficult, just as what I did to svf player.
Svf player is originally implemented in vsprog.
There is only one way to get these debugging protocols, from Atmel or from 
Silab. I don't like re-engineering, if they don't like these protocols open.

&gt;<i> The mission statement that I proposed derives from the fact that I can
</I>&gt;<i> imagine a very big box.  Others may have smaller boxes in mind.
</I>&gt;<i> Practically speaking, the implementation is a much smaller box.
</I>I can try to implement it if the box is big enough.
Vsprog is only designed to support programming chips with Versaloon.

As &quot;John Devereux&quot; wrote, there is an excellent tool to program AVR.
I'm using avrdude too. So I just want to make sure that whether the support 
to AVR in OpenOCD is meaningful. And technically, I think it will be very easy 
because the protocols are open and simple. My another tool AVRminiProg 
supports this 3 years ago.

&gt;<i> If you do decide to take a heroic leap, just be prepared to help with
</I>&gt;<i> the eventual merge, or you might need to maintain the patches
</I>&gt;<i> out-of-tree until we clean up any existing mess for you.  Consider the
</I>&gt;<i> statistical life expectancy of heroes before you take the plunge, and
</I>&gt;<i> make sure to post regular reports of your progress during development.
</I>&gt;<i> The community can keep you from unnecessarily &quot;falling&quot; off of a cliff.
</I>I can first try to add support to AVR flash programming thru JTAG.
If it is OK, it will be easy to add support to other MCUs as C8051F and so on.
I'll report when there is a problem.
