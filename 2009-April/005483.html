<PRE>Hi,
Attachment is the update for vsllink against SVN.
1. some tweaks
2. add DMA mode using original vsllink TAP
3. add configure file

BTW:
I find that -Werror is added to the compilation option.
And in Cygwin, it's OK. But in MinGW(I'll test later on Ubuntu), there will be warnings:
1. jim.c:11979: warning: function declaration isn't a prototype
2. jim-eventloop.c:283: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned
3. jim-eventloop.c:284: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned
4. jim-eventloop.c:285: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned
5. jim-eventloop.c:360: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned
6. jim-eventloop.c:361: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned
7. jim-eventloop.c:362: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned
8. replacements.c:179: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned
9. replacements.c:182: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned
10. replacements.c:185: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned
11. replacements.c:255: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned
12. replacements.c:261: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned
13. replacements.c:266: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned
14. replacements.c:270: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned
15. server.c:335: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned
16. server.c:348: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned
17.gdb_server.c:125: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned

warning 2 to 17 is raised because first parameter of FD_SET or FD_CLR is int type, 
which is compared to a u_int type according to header files in MinGW.
