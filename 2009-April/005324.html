Yes, I agree wholeheartedly.  It is easy to over use the features of 
C++, especially in an embedded setting.  C++ is a rich language.  But it 
is not impossible to get 80% of the value in using it by using only 10% 
of its features.  We do it on our SoftPLC runtime, which is an embedded 
process controller with great success.

The biggest hurdle to the switch is getting a C++ runtime library in 
place, period.  On Linux, that work is zero.  On Windows, I dare say it 
is near zero with mingw. 

On other platforms I cannot imagine.   I don't really understand why 
somebody needs a small small computer to run openocd anyway.  A 64 mbyte 
linux box can be about as small as you want it nowadays, so I am not 
totally empathetic to this concern about supporting *all* non-linux 
embedded environments.  Maybe a minimum feature set for targets could be 
identified.
