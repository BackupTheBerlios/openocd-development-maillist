The EXIT2_DR form is how it appears in most documentation I have seen,
so I think there is value with these changes.  But, yeah, IEEE could
have done better.

I gave this some thought; a simple script might be the best approach.
It would automatically produce and apply a series of 16 or 17
incremental patches, one for each symbol that needs renaming.  This
approach would help reduce collisions with working copies, as anyone
with outstanding patches could run the script on their WC _before_ doing
an 'svn up' through the relevant commits.  It seems like this would be
faster and cleaner to manage the process than other approaches, but I
posting it here for consideration and feedback.

&gt;<i> Value changes:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This *should* be safe (as a goal), but I would be only about 90% sure 
</I>&gt;<i> that it is at this moment.   I tried to move the code in the direction 
</I>&gt;<i> of switch()es instead of arrays which where were dependent on array 
</I>&gt;<i> index values matching symbol values.  But I do not know that all such 
</I>&gt;<i> situations were corrected.  So I think we should keep an open eye on 
</I>&gt;<i> this change for awhile, and keep the goal in mind.
</I>
This was one of my concerns, but it's in tree now.  Heads up everyone!
If nothing else, I think this can serve as both motivation and means to
find and fix any remaining places where there are problems.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and finally
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; TAP_INVALID is used in the target code to mean &quot;TAP DONT CARE&quot; so 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; calling it invalid is  a bit misleading.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are places in the code where we have a don't care, and elsewhere 
</I>&gt;<i> an invalid or initial undefined state.  So we would need two symbols to 
</I>&gt;<i> be perfect.  With that would come unnecessary complexity.   The current 
</I>&gt;<i> symbol might be good enough.
</I>
While their semantics may be the same today, I see no reason to assume
that will always be the case.  It seems like &quot;nuanced&quot; error reporting
would not be possible without two symbols, but what else?  If we do want
to distinguish them from one another someday, the existing symbol is
sufficiently unique to allow quick grep-based hacking.

Whether or not we keep TAP_INVALID, I vote for TAP_UNKNOWN instead of
TAP_DONT_CARE.

&gt;<i> I wish to remind the team that next week I will be working on the ft2232 
</I>&gt;<i> driver.   This is with or without the patch from Duane.  That is my time 
</I>&gt;<i> slot, and it is not movable due to some manufacturing test schedules 
</I>&gt;<i> that I have to meet for a new ARM board we are making:
</I>
Nifty.  Will you get a chance to take a look at the revised High-Speed
device patch that I posted recently?

Cheers,

Zach
