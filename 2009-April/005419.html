Did you mean &quot;on as default&quot;?  I hope that to be the case, as I think
most developers do not report warnings - only errors.  I would even want
releases to have it enabled, as any warning that escapes QA reflects
something that was missed (or a potentially &quot;unsupported&quot; compiler).
I think those issues should be taken as seriously as &quot;real&quot; errors.

Since I prefer to see reports from builds using -Werror, I believe the
--disable-werror workaround should be used only when a patch will not be
immediately forthcoming to address the issue.  Further, that option can
be made mandatory for certain corner cases as a last resort. heck, the
configuration script could do it automatically (e.g. for releases).

To play my own devil's advocate, -Werror does not fit the premise that
the build system should &quot;fail gracefully&quot;.  While I believe that
principle applies more to run-time behaviors, developers spend more time
&quot;running&quot; the build system.  Without abandoning it completely, I posit
that a more practical policy would be &quot;fail fast and hard, but then
provide a means to gracefully work around the problems (if possible).&quot;

In any case, I am sensitive to the issues involved and will be
interested to see the community's reaction.

&gt;<i> Since you're willing to address issues that are brought up here, I'm
</I>&gt;<i> applying the patch to see if we can navigate some dire straits
</I>&gt;<i> w/a few patches and then be out into more open water...
</I>
It has not been hard to deal with the problems so far, so I doubt there
will be anything that causes big problems for recent versions of gcc.
In my mind, the bigger question is that of general compatibility with
the pool of non-gcc compilers that are actively being used; are such
even being used in this community?

If it turns out there is more work than I anticipated, I am definitely
in favor of removing -Werror from the default settings, but I hope the
community instead concludes the benefits outweigh the short-term price
and will work together to resolve any remaining and future warnings.

Cheers,

Zach
