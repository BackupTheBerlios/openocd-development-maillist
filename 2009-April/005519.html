<PRE>Jeff,

I think we all need to take a deep breath for a second.  The project is 
managed in SVN, there can be a revert of changes to a different revision 
and Zach or some one else can repeat the warning removal process.  
Warning removal is much more trackable than the stuff you have 
accomplished.  I think that is why  &#216;yvind requested a patch against 
your version of OpenOCD.  It may be salvageable if there is a rollback 
of current work.  All is not lost.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes there are significant changes, I can not comment about the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> improvements in efficency. The BIG problem is that it broke existing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> code, mainly the ftdi2232 interface. This is  not  perfect by any  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> means
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and needs work, but it is a main workhorse in OpenOCD. Duane has put
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work into getting  the patch to work with this but has not been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> succesful. So IMHO this patch was not ready for inclusion. I think  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Zacks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work is very important, it breaks some pending patches, even for me in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other ares, but it also creates a better foundation to work from.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As to the MC1322x support, I have read a lot of the list  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> communications
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> going back to march and also checked the Freescale manual. It seems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MC1322x should be a fairly standard ARM7TDMI-S.  So MC1322x should  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with OpenOCD with perhaps some configuration and startup tweaks.  The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem is the JLink interface, it is known to never have worked  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 100% .
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So my suggestion for going forward is:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Zack keeps cleaning up the code.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Test and debug MC1322x support using a FT2232 based interface.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Test and debug JLink code on target we have lots of experience with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Update the jag/tap code, but this can only be done if it works with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all already supported interfaces.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Best regards,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Magnus
