I'm not sure whether this is a good idea. There are many combinations of
JTAG dongles and processors. The JTAG TAP interface is least of the
problems when dealing with JTAG. The problem is always in the layers
behind the JTAG interface. If you want to develop a test suite you'll
need to simulate all the supported CPUs, flashes, etc. Worse, a
simulator is never 100% like the real thing. More worse, JTAG seems to
be the last thing on the list to implement on a chip so implementations
often contain bugs and other undocumented mayhem which may be different
between devices in the same family and/or steppings (device revisions).

In others words: nothing beats testing with a real target and there will
always be new devices that require some patching.

Another item for the list: With some imagination it would be possible to
simulate a UART or an SPI interface using the JTAG dongle. Maybe even
bit I/O using the RST en TRST pins. This would allow extending OpenOCD
into a  universal programmer for microcontrollers.
