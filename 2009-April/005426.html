</I>&gt;<i> The stumbling block is this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Right now, after my changes, the FT2232 no longer functions correctly.
</I>&gt;<i>     I need to fully understand
</I>&gt;<i>         (a) what the FT2232 opcode are doing,
</I>&gt;<i>         (b) what the tap is expecting to be done.
</I>&gt;<i>         (c) I suspect - because of the earlier problem, ie: the FT2232 
</I>&gt;<i> outputing different tap sequences then other taps
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suspect, but don't have evidence that this bug is actually a 
</I>&gt;<i> combination problem of
</I>&gt;<i>     (1) my fix is probably correct, but
</I>&gt;<i>     (2) there is/was something else that this needs fixing, now that I 
</I>&gt;<i> fixed this step.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The changes, are - on the surface *very* simple,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OLD:
</I>&gt;<i>     int tap_get_tms_path(  tap_state_t from, tap_state_t to );
</I>&gt;<i>     Return value was:  &quot;7 bits for the tms sequence&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> NEW:
</I>&gt;<i>     void tap_get_tms_path( tap_state_t from, tap_state_t to, int 
</I>&gt;<i> *tms_path, int *tms_len );
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This would reference the new tap table that Jeff Williams did a while ago.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The idea is/was:
</I>&gt;<i>      (a) the *tms_path* now holds the bit sequence.
</I>&gt;<i>      (b) the *tms_len* now holds the number of bits in that sequence.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then, you just wade through all of the places that GCC complains about 
</I>&gt;<i> the parameters being wrong, examine and fix the offending situation. 
</I>&gt;<i> Often the solution is simple... There is a simple for( x = 0 ; x &lt; 7 ; 
</I>&gt;<i> x++ ) type loop... Those are simple ones.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would somebody like to &quot;pick up my pieces&quot; and take a closer look at the 
</I>&gt;<i> where I'm at?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -Duane.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
I understand the time problem.  It does not cost anything to post the 
patch that you have so far.   I would like to look at it to measure the 
amount of work to get it working.  This measurement would then be used 
against my schedule.   Next week is fine for me, this week I can spare 
several hours at most.   If it rolls into next week, then I am good for 
the duration of the fixing process next week, whatever it takes.
