</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have merged in the recent icebear patch.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>OK, with one tweak to the new table, the new driver + new table seems to 
me that it could be at 100%.  I also did some benchmarking, comparing

new driver + new table
to
new driver + old table

and the only test I could think of was writing to an 4 mbyte CFI flash 
on ARM9:

new table:  5.55 kb/s
old table: 5.47 kb/s

So this is about a 1.4 % reduction.

So I guess USB turnaround latency is the bottle neck, not the bitrate?  
Or the flash burn rate?  Maybe writing to RAM is a better test.

I still want to play with the ft2232.c code for another day or so before 
I post the [PATCH] here.  I want to test it under the xsvf.c code, which 
will finally give me state transition logging.

The state transition logging was nice in finding this problem.  I just 
took the two log files, loaded them both into Jedit.  Then I stripped 
the leading &quot;Debug 123 455&quot; stuff off of both files and then used the 
JDiff plugin to show me the differences between the two logs.  The 
location of the problem revealed itself in minutes.  The solution was a 
little black magic however.  We needed another clock while in RESET when 
going from RESET to DRSHIFT.  Don't know why.  But the old table had 3 
such clocks.
