<PRE>1. The underlaying jtag_* layer should produce the same transitions
regardless of the JTAG device. Is there a technical reason why that is
not possible? The ARM11 driver is certainly programmed with that
assumption in mind.

I don't think the tap_get_tms_path() is a usable solution, i would
probably just use explicit pathmove instead because the resulting code
would be heavily cluttered with tons of IFs trying to figure out what
the JTAG driver is doing. Plus it is not testable by those of us that
don't keep piles of different JTAG devices around.


2. My proposal to deal with alternative paths would be as follows:

All available alternatives can be encoded in a bit field and passed as
extra parameter to the relevant calls or set in some sort of
jtag_set_paths(u32 paths) function.

For example:
bit0 Capture-DR
bit1 Capture-IR
bit2 Exit1-DR
bit3 Exit1-IR
bit4 Exit2-DR
bit5 Exit2-IR
bit6 Update-DR
bit7 Update-IR

The semantics would be as follows:
- If in a transition between states one of these eight states lays in
the path and
- if it is possible to reach the destination by choosing either 0 or 1
in that state
then use the value from the bit field.

The shortest possible path is selected by setting all bits in the mask
to 1 except for Exit2-?R.


3. On a mildly related note, since that was discussed here last week,
the restrictions to stable states are in conflict with the actual TAPs
which are usually optimized to allow maximum bang for the clock tick.

As a result the driver code is not in sync with the documentation both
in regards to the TAP states used and the way algorithms are wrapped
into functions and the driver is layered. For example in the arm11
code it is not possible for a lower layer which ends its algorithm at
Update-DR to know if the layer above needs to go via RTI or not. So
the lower layer leaves the TAP at Pause-DR instead thus outsourcing
the move to Update-DR to an upper layer. This results in unnecessary
complexity in the code and most likely in chaos when someone later
touches this fragile house of cards.

The stable-states-only restriction should be retired at the earliest
possible opportunity. And it should weighted if the benefits of
supporting severely restricted JTAG hardware outweigh the problems of
adding complexity and potential for errors in the target drivers.

At the least I would like to know if it would be possible to have the
stable-states-only restriction applied only to the final state before
jtag_execute_queue().
