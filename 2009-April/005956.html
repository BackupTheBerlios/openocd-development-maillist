Actually, the TCL layer is using TCL objects which in the JIM  
implementation of TCL, happen to be pointers.  Of course, with JIM, we  
didn't need to build our own runtime, so things like determining the  
type of an object is handled for us.

I've had a number of ideas on how to rewrite OpenOCD in an object- 
oriented fashion (be it in C++, Objective-C, or C with a custom built  
runtime).  Mainly I see a benefit in streamlining how we develop  
targets.  Today, it is a manual process where a target is a set of C  
functions that are collected under a target type.  In practice, those  
functions rely on some stack of internal layers (cortex-m3 relies on  
adiv5 relies on jtag....).  All of that is hard-coded into the target  
and introducing a new target can be daunting.

  Instead, an object-oriented model where each layer is a separate  
object allows for much more dynamic handling of targets.  We can also  
consolidate common behavior into superclasses and split large blocks  
of functionality into finer grain classes.  For example, an FT2232  
device could be represented as a subclass of the Interface class.   
That subclass could in turn have each port be a different object (A  
could be a JTAGPort subclass while B could be a SerialPort subclass).   
Then a JTAGProtocol class could be attached to the JTAGPort.  That  
allows the implementation of the JTAG hardware to be split from the  
JTAG protocol (state machine, etc).  Such a separation not only makes  
the code easier to understand, but the pieces can also be tested in  
isolation.

Going to an extreme, the classes could also incorporate an API that  
describes the types of classes they should be attached to.  This  
allows for dynamic loading and automatic configuration of classes.  A  
certain amount of seeding would be necessary, but it could simplify  
things to the point that telling OpenOCD you have an FT2232-based  
interface is sufficient for it to figure out what targets, flashes,  
and plds are available.

it with him.&quot;
