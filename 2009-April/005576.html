<PRE>Hi all,

Here is the current list of outstanding tasks for the OpenOCD project.

In this revision, I have tried to incorporate all of the feedback from
the group since my last posting (&quot;my tech proposal&quot;).  I reorganized the
order and updated items to improve both clarity and brevity (though that
could easily be debated).  I am still seeking input for additions,
corrections, or other feedback (e.g. &quot;file it where the Sun....&quot;).

To wit, I believe that the community could paint a more complete picture
of its lustful technological desires, but I am reminded of my recent
comment to &#216;yvind about these types of documents becoming &quot;monumental
testimonials to the good intentions of the ambitious.&quot;  While I will
endeavor to keep The List out of that realm, I also want to encourage
free discourse and consideration of what could be possible for OpenOCD.

The addition of a new &quot;in progress&quot; symbol could be said to be moving
this toward an &quot;advisory locking&quot; scheme, though I reiterate my belief
that strict adherence to such borders on asininity.  I only want to help
avoid more SNAFUs around here; I think this type of information needs to
be conveyed clearly and regularly, to avoid misunderstandings among
active participants.

I also added the list of developers actively participating in the
development or testing of various targets and interfaces.  If you would
like to see your name added or removed, feel free to contact me on or
off the list.  This is a new section; it is expected to be incomplete.

Thanks to everyone in the community that contributed to making this list
possible and worth compiling.  I have been made to feel welcome here and
look forward to seeing what comes of our efforts.

Cheers,

Zach Welch

================================================================== 
                             The List
==================================================================
OpenOCD's Pending and Open Tasks (r1506)
------------------------------------------------------------------

The '+' items have a current patch, 'o' are in progress by the
individual whose initials are indicated, and '-' items are open.
The key to initials associated with tasks appears after the list.

* JTAG/TAP changes:
  - use tap_set_state everywhere to allow logging TAP state transitions
  o add new TAP state table (provided by JW) (ZW)
  - update tap_get_tms_path API (suggested by DE)
    - slow boat: add tap_get_tms_path2 and allow both for a while
    - convert drivers that use old API over to the new one
    - remove old tap_get_tms_path
  - rename other tap_states to use standard JTAG names (suggested by ML)
    - write script that automate production of the series of 16-17 patches
    - produce and distribute current series against the current trunk
    - distribute script so developers can use on WC through live commits
    - make live commits after giving sufficient notice to others
  - add TAP_UNKNOWN to augment TAP_INVALID? (suggested by ML/DH)
  
* CFI:
  + speed enhancements (posted Apr 22 by NC) (??)
  - factor vendor-specific code into separate source files
  - add new callback interface for vendor-specific code
  - finish implementing bus width/chip width handling (suggested by NC)
  - investigate/implement &quot;thin wrapper&quot; to use eCos CFI drivers (&#216;H)

* JTAG Interfaces:

  o FT2232 driver: (DH)
    + integrate FTD2XX High-Speed Device Patch (JK+ZW)
    - fix segfault from long scan chains (observed by DH)
    - fix non-recoverability of cable connect/reconnect (seen by DH)
    - cure buggy madness

  o J-Link driver: (ZW)
    + add state debugging (provided by JW)
    - cure buggy madness
    - test with known targets (i.e. working with other interfaces)
    - test compatibility between v6.0 (yellow) and older units (e.g. v5.2)

  - Do others need some help?  Probably....

* Target Support:

  + MC1322x support (JW/DE?)
    - integrate and test support from JW (and DE?)
    - get working with a known good interface (i.e. not today's jlink)

  o Cortex A8 support (ML)
    o? verify the cortex-swjdp portion against CoreSight specifications
    o? update cortex-swjdp to support A8
    o? add target implementation
    - what else remains to be done?

  - ARM11 improvements
    - implement missing functionality (grep FNC_INFO_NOTIMPLEMENTED ...)

  - Coldfire (suggested by NC)
    - can we draw from the BDM project?  <A HREF="http://bdm.sourceforge.net/">http://bdm.sourceforge.net/</A>
 
  - other targets?  (suggestions always welcome)

* Architectural Upgrades
  - Allow N:M:P mapping of servers, targets, and interfaces
  - loadable module support for interface/target/flash drivers

* Miscellaneous:
  + continue to improve state and system debugging (from JW) (ZW)
  - review and clean up interface/target/flash APIs 
  - factor code to eliminate duplicated functionality
  - overhaul use of types to improve 32/64-bit portability
