And with this understanding in place, it means that drivers cannot use 
the new table without also using the new call to

      int tap_get_tms_path_len( tap_state_t from, tap_state_t to )


So this makes the migration more difficult.  One thought that could 
enable a graceful migration is to have two tables in there, but compile 
the needed one depending on which driver is in play.  One of the two 
tables is the old table, and one is the new table.  Then as each driver 
is updated, we just remove another #if defined() test from jtag.c


#if defined(&lt;driver1&gt;) || defined(&lt;driver2&gt;) || defined(&lt;driver3&gt;)

    /* drivers needing the old table */

    ... old table declaration here

#else

    .. new table

#endif


There may be another way, but I don't see it.
