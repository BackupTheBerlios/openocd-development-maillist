Igor,

Why do you feel it is necessary to support MSVC?  Mingw during runtime 
is lean, a very thin layer, and one that comes from Microsoft.  There is 
nothing to install for the runtime requirements.  There is already on 
the windows box the required DLL, I believe it is called MSVCRTD.DLL or 
similar.

There will be no speed advantage since the cable is the bottle neck.

Mingw is an excellent runtime setup.  I do not know if windows openocd 
requires msys or cygwin at runtime.  But in theory it would be easy to 
remove that dependency if it exists, leaving you with only MSVCRTD.DLL.  
And that DLL usually comes with Windows.  How easy is that?  What is the 
problem with gnu gcc in the form of mingw-gcc that you are running away 
from?

As I said before, I personally would be willing to give up designated 
initializers, but really nothing more within C99.  And I really love the 
iterator type stuff:

for( int i=0;  i&lt;7;  ++i)

where i is declared within the for loop.


Sorry I have lost most of my enthusiasm, but I don't understand your 
problem probably.  Please explain if you can.

Dick
