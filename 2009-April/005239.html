I agree, but I decided that first the files should be moved and than 
they may be modified. I cannot modify all of them, as I have no means 
for testing, but I can try changing some of them. Also note that some of 
them do use the [source ...] scheme (the pxa and linksys nslu).

Some files would also be hard to modify, as (I think so) some options 
cannot be overriden. For example, the file str910-eval.cfg could source 
the str912.cfg if not for the following line:

$_TARGETNAME configure -work-area-phys 0x50000000 -work-area-virt 
0x50000000 -work-area-size 16384 -work-area-backup 1

In str912.cfg the line reads:

$_TARGETNAME configure -work-area-virt 0 -work-area-phys 0x50000000 
-work-area-size 16384 -work-area-backup

(-work-area-virt and -work-area-backup)

Or maybe I'm mistaken. Maybe all commands can be overriden and only the 
last one parsed is valid?

Anyway - I think that the target dir should contain nothing more than 
target (bare chip), and the board dir should be for some popular boards, 
as now it's pretty messed up (; The 'which one includes what and where' 
is another thing...

4\/3!!
