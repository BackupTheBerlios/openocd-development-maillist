I looked at the BDM project Xiaofan posted. It seems like a good
starting point. It also has routines for external flash. Maybe its worth
to look into it to get some fresh ideas on the cfi implementation as
well. I used to have a Coldfire board but we returned it because of the
lack of proper hardware programming tools (Codesourcery has a complete
GCC kit for Coldfire).

&gt;<i> &gt; I see CFI is on your list as well. I have a slightly 
</I>&gt;<i> improved version 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of cfi.c which some speed enhancements. Shall I mail it to 
</I>&gt;<i> you to have 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a look at it? I agree the cfi code is not very clean; a lot of code 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which basically does the same is duplicated.  Also the bus width / 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; chip width handling is not fully implemented yet. IMHO 
</I>&gt;<i> vendor specific 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code could be just a bunch of functions called through function 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pointers from cfi.c.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Post code to the list, but we are on the same wavelength.  Completely.
</I>
Okay, I've attached a patch to cfi.c to this e-mail. Note this is a work
in progress. It works for my situation though (Spansion flash). The
major change I made is adding cfi_spansion_wait_write and calling
keep_alive to avoid the usleep when calling alive_sleep(1). Sleeping the
CPU during erase is fine, but not during programming. This still needs
masking (bus width) and perhaps checking endianess.
