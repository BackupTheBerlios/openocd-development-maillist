single stepping is broken on parport, but reportedly it works on
ft2232.

I have not seen single stepping working on i.mx31 yet. I'll try to
dig up an ft2232 interface.

&gt;<i> I read between the lines that his conclusion was more pathmoves while

</I>&gt;<i> consistent/well-defined results on all hardware and *then* adding
</I>&gt;<i> pathmoves if they are still needed.
</I>
If the jtag machine is implemented in hardware, then you won't have
precise control over state moves normally. So, my thinking is that
jtag_add_pathmove() should be used whenever there are precise
requirements.

Actually: to test if jtag_add_pathmove()'s are required, then
it would be useful to run a test against a target: once using
the old table and another using the new optimal table.

If the target fails with either, more jtag_add_pathmove()'s are
required.
