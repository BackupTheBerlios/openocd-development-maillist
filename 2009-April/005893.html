This is a superbly excellent question.  One that is related to my 
question about WTF is the tap machine even doing while I am programming 
an FPGA.  This is precisely why I felt it absolutely necessary to 
implement state transition logging.  That exists in its earliest form on 
the ft2232.c patch I just submitted.  Once we have this in place for 
*all* drivers, then it might actually be possible to ANSWER your most 
excellent question, which is related to mine.

You could then compare the paths taken between two cables.
