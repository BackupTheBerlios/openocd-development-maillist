As a rule, comparisons between a signed and an unsigned value are a
bit... risky. When you build with -Werror and compile on x86_64, gcc
will complain at you. That's the problem.

Realistically, you're correct. I'd argue that nobody would probably need
more than 2^32 ms anyways, so why not just make it a u32 and be done
with it. ;-)

&gt;<i> If we are going to change anything here, then *all* places should be fixed
</I>&gt;<i> and we should have the reasoning right in the first place.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
There are a few things I would recommend changing:

1) in types.h u32 is badly defined for non-IA32. unsigned long is 8
bytes on x86_64.
2) based on this, add a ptr_t. There were cases where pointers were being
cast for debugging output, for example.

I'm happy to go through and add these things myself, but my plan was
just to fix the build errors preventing me from being able to do some
debugging on my target platform. Nothing too crazy/invasive!

Cheers,
Phil
