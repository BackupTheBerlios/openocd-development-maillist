Having developed large projects in both languages, my approach would be
different enough that they would be unrecognizable from one another.
They would be two different projects.  At that point, preserve this C
implementation for those who want it and add a complementing/competing
implementation in C++ and build it up without any legacy encumbrances.  

Even a fresh start in C would quickly gain the lead if developed with
the experience gained from OpenOCD; however, it would take the community
of existing developers using and testing it from the start.  OpenOCD
would effectively have to fork itself, though it would probably be
called a &quot;branch&quot;.  Personally, I see Linux 2.6 as a fork of 2.4, not
what most of us consider a branch.  Further, 'git' shows what can be
done when a large base of developers and users sets their mind on
creating replacement tools.  That could be done here for a next
generation of OpenOCD, but I would not encourage that for reasons
deserving their own thread(s).

That said, I would not be opposed to seeing our C99-ish code compile
with both gcc and g++, but that could be insane itself.   I have a hard
time imagining that they could both compile the code -- with strict
warnings -- unless dubious tricks are used.  C99 would be good enough.

&gt;<i> Again, my apologies for not being specific enough.   In fact I see now 
</I>&gt;<i> that Igor did say what the problems were:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) variable declarations not at the start of block
</I>&gt;<i> 2) designated initializers (.field = value)
</I>&gt;<i> 3) no unistd.h
</I>
The last problem can be fixed by using the HAVE_UNISTD_H definition, but
let's not forget other C99 features (some of which we already mentioned
or are I know are used in the code):

  4) // comments
  5) new block scopes for selection and iteration statements
  6) trailing comma allowed in enum declaration
  7) inline functions

Many or all of these features may also be supported in older compilers,
but OpenOCD should consider using at least these C99 features.  
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have no love for MS VC and I have a great deal of respect for GNU 
</I>&gt;<i> C/C++.    So I hereby reverse my opinion, I am only willing to give up 
</I>&gt;<i> designated initializers, not more.
</I>
Personally, I love the new designated initializers, so I am reluctant to
see those go.  Nevertheless, I am not taking an official stance yet,
only trying to contribute to the discussion on language feature support
in OpenOCD.  I think these topics have been debated off and on recently
and it would be nice to put the topic to rest for a time.

If Igor submits a patch, we should apply it if it moves us forward, but
it would be nice to be able to update the documentation to reflect a set
of current coding standards that begin to allow C99 features.  I have
started editing the relevant section of openocd.texi, but these issues
need to work themselves out through community discussion.

Cheers,

Zach
