I love it.  Positively love it.

I have a strong networking background, so I could whip up an example
some free afternoon.  I do not see why it would be slow.  Even 10Mbit/s
easily gives 50kB/s+ over the wire, and I bet many of us are running at
least 100Mbit/s.  I think the JTAG interface will remain the bottleneck
if this runs on a local network.  Incidentally, I seem to recall reading
about an official IEEE JTAG-over-ethernet protocol somewhere.

Of course, you say that you want to do this for remote development over
the internet.  Ummm....  I have to reach over and physically reset my
target or JTAG interface on occasion.  I love the enthusiasm, but there
are some limits to the power of remote software control.  Or do you have
a remote telepresence solution on hand that you failed to mention?

More practically, this would allow companies to use dumb programmer PCs
on the factory floor that are controlled by a (distantly) remote
station; much easier to secure the proprietary sources from industrial
espionage.  That begs me to ask: does anyone here worry about this type
of issue?  If you do, would you even be able to tell us about it? ;)

Nevertheless, this idea allows me to introduce the full potential that
you have just presented to the OpenOCD project:

Given the cost of a netbook plus USB JTAG dongle, wouldn't these
features undercut the price of ethernet-based JTAG programmer/debuggers
out on the market today?  Why not just use this proposed TCP/IP JTAG
layer between a PC and commodity part devices?  

If my reading of this is correct, you are interested in offering your
resources to an endeavor that might cannibalize your sales.  Whoops.
Talk about looking the gift horse in the mouth.  But if you are still
interested, I think it's a great idea and worth pursuing.  It has made
it on The List, and it's not going away without a pay-off.  ;)  Kidding!

Rick's points about clean-up and testing do apply, though.  I would not
want to start that without a lot of additional low-level grunt work.

Cheers,

Zach
