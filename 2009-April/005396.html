I'm starting to read the documents Rick gave in

It's my understanding that we have these commands now with

<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2009-April/005305.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2009-April/005305.html</A>

?

&gt;<i> Next, item is figuring out how the DAP is configured in the A8 - and 
</I>&gt;<i> which 'ports' are implemented. on this beast, ie: What access points out 
</I>&gt;<i> of the DAP are implemented. In the M3 - it seems nicely documented This 
</I>&gt;<i> part, I'm a bit confused about. Are you? Anybody else? The diagram 
</I>&gt;<i> (figure 2-2 above for the M3) shows a &quot;SELECT&quot; register... offset 8 in 
</I>&gt;<i> the DPACC range, the output of which becomes the APSEL (access port 
</I>&gt;<i> select).  Hence, my idea of having a &quot;dap&quot; command that lets one 
</I>&gt;<i> experiment and figure things out. Ideas/Suggestions? Objections?
</I>
Looking at the TRMs, yes, it seems that it's not documented what 
access points out of the DAP are implemented for Cortex A8 (OMAP3 
ARM's part). Did I miss something or are there any news?

If not, the plan is to use the &quot;dap&quot; command and try to get this by 
try &amp; error. Correct?

&gt;<i> It seems, that we need to look at address 0xffc - in the &quot;rom table&quot; and 
</I>&gt;<i> work backwards from there, ie: See IHI 0031A - section 1.2.3, And - 
</I>&gt;<i> section 13.2 - the CID0 to CID3 registers... should lets us &quot;walk&quot; the 
</I>&gt;<i> register tables. however, it seems the cortex_swjdp.c - seems to be some 
</I>&gt;<i> what &quot;purpose built&quot; for the M3. Agree? Or am I missing something?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> =====
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My guess the &quot;jtag-acces-port&quot; interface is not one that is implemented, 
</I>&gt;<i> but is documented in IHI 0031A, ie: section 2.2.1
</I>&gt;<i> this would be used for things internal that are Jtag type devices - 
</I>&gt;<i> which don't exist.
</I>
For what we have already in OpenOCD (jrc config), I still have two 
questions:

- For OMAP3 JRC we get ID code

0x0b7ae02f (Manufacturer: 0x017, Part: 0xb7ae, Version: 0x0)

and OMAP3 CPU gives

0x0B6D602F (Manufacturer: 0x017, Part: 0xB6D6, Version: 0x0)

This 0x017 doesn't seem to be ARM ID. Is there somewhere an JTAG 
manufacturer list which can be used to decode these IDs?

- We already had a short discussion about this, but I couldn't figure 
how to add

jtag tapenable omap3.cpu

to a OpenOCD instead of doing it manually, yet. Any additional hints?

Many thanks and best regards

Dirk
