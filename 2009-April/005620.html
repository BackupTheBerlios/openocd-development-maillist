Where did I say switch?  No &quot;switch&quot;.

I do not have a problem with multiple build systems, as long as they can
keep out of each others' way.  Since our &quot;users&quot; are developers, I think
we can safely assume that they will have strong preferences about a
build system.  I'd put it somewhere below the choice of editors, but
it's on all of our mental scorecards.  Fair enough?

If we can offer both, we should offer a choice.  Choice is good when it
gives benefits that outweighed the cost of allowing the choice.  But my
proposed social contract with Dick above puts the onus on his shoulders
to continue to maintain CMake support long after it has hit the tree, or
to find other maintainers from the community.  There should be zero cost
to the community that only wants to use autotools, but we would make
non-zero number of developers happier and more likely to hack the code.

I am an autotools fan, but I believe in freedom of build systems.  I can
hack CMake too and would be happy to have help mastering it.  I hope
that such interest flows both ways, as there is little to be gained by
choosing one tool and climbing into its ivory tower for all time.

As for ongoing maintenance, the community either steps up or doesn't.
If the CMake build repeatedly lets down the community in the long run,
then *squish* go those bits.  But if he will agree here on this list, I
doubt he will ever let that happen; if we give him the chance to build a
community following, I think all of this will be proven moot.

Look at it another way, developer X wants feature Y, submits a patch to
add it.  The patch adds value for them, doesn't interfere with other
parts of the package, and it will make more than a few users happy.  

I do not believe that &quot;lack of enthusiasm&quot; can stand; please check your
reasoning and try your excuse again. :)

Cheers,

Zach
