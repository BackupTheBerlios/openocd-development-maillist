If question, yes.  tap_set_state() is in the &quot;Cable helper API&quot; and 
anything in there is thought to be callable (only) from cable drivers.   
An aid to implementing this is to figure out where clock cycles are 
being issued.  On any such clock output issuance, there is potential for 
a state transition and a need for the call to tap_set_state().  That is 
a recipe for a rigorous state tracker.

I guess it is the notion that the cable drivers have the most knowledge 
of the clock cycles that gives this justification.
