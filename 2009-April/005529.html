Could you clarify exactly which &quot;decision&quot; we have to live with?  

I can understand living with the decision to leave a project, have made
it (or having had it made for me) numerous times over the years.  I know
that I do not want to be the one to find himself unwittingly on the
other side of that table.  You are not letting us down here; if
anything, it is community has let you down.

Personally, I think you have just been a victim of poor coordination on
the part of the group, not the machinations of any one individual.  None
of us would have taken the steps that we did, had we know this would be
the outcome.  It's called a SNAFU.  That said...

I can live with my decision to move forward with the code.
I can live with my decision to break work that is still in progress, as
I can live with my decision to try and help fix the problems I caused.
I can live with my decision to swagger a little bit for all this effort.

Open source can suck this way, but it's still beats the alternative.
I am again sorry that things turned out this way, but I hope you will
give your decision some thought.

Cheers,

Zach
