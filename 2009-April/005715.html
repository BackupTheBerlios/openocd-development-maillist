</I>That is true if you only consider tep tap state engine,  and not the 
effects on the target. For shifts we usually want an exact number of 
transitions from this state and this is similar in systems that uses RTI 
to clock the core. We can also note that TAP_DRSCAN and TAP_IRSCAN are 
never used as an endstate in target code. It is only used in jtag 
interface code within scan commands to reach the SHIFT states, and then 
we transition out to another stable state. So allowing only stable 
states  because other endstates are unsafe, and allowing SCANS as 
endstates from target code is not consistent.

I agree with Laurent

&gt;<i>	JTAG STABLE STATE are : RESET / IDLE / IRPAUSE / DRPAUSE
</I>

</I>&gt;<i> I would go blind looking at these arrays.   You talk about using

</I>&gt;<i> anything to me.  I am not a computer.  The code has to be readable, as 
</I>&gt;<i> a human.  Maybe I mis-understand you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes symbolic constant must be used, but they generate very long lines 
and this mail system will mess it up terribly. But you can get the tomorrow.
&gt;<i> We already have the jtag_add_pathmove() function.  Its API is elegant 
</I>&gt;<i> and in theory it can do anything we need anywhere.   Why do we need 
</I>&gt;<i> other?  
</I>jtag_add_pathmove is good, i like it, it is the jtag_statemove and the 
bittable of 7 step transitions specified in terms of TMS seuences that 
is as clear and elegant, unless you really get deeply involved in jtag
&gt;<i> What is more readable than an array of states through which you wish
