MinGW and cygwin should work, not sure if there are other ways to compile it.

I think mingw works currently, although I haven't tried.
Cygwin is currently not a requirement, just an option.

&gt;<i> And I am allergic to Windows, so there will need to be a &quot;CMake on Windows&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> champion to step up and take this bull by the horns.
</I>
Good luck finding that one :)


&gt;<i> You can defer that goal and get yourself running on Cygwin for now. &#160;I would
</I>&gt;<i> look at these links and modify the src/CMakeLists.txt file accordingly:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/cmake2.6docs.html#section_Generators">http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/cmake2.6docs.html#section_Generators</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At line 299 there is the if(CYGWIN) test. &#160;I believe by using the proper
</I>&gt;<i> command line option to cmake, namely the -G option, you essentially can tell
</I>&gt;<i> Cmake that you are on cygwin. &#160;Then it sets the CYGWIN variable, which in
</I>&gt;<i> turn sets our IS_CYGWIN at line 300.
</I>
I found two problems with that, first the whole block of if's needs to
be moved up, before the configure_file() call. And the set() functions
in that block all have a superfluous comma in them.

With these changes the config.h works. But there is still some problem
with cygwin include file conflicts. I am looking at this right now.
