<PRE>Hi

Yes there are significant changes, I can not comment about the 
improvements in efficency. The BIG problem is that it broke existing 
code, mainly the ftdi2232 interface. This is  not  perfect by any means 
and needs work, but it is a main workhorse in OpenOCD. Duane has put 
work into getting  the patch to work with this but has not been 
succesful. So IMHO this patch was not ready for inclusion. I think Zacks 
work is very important, it breaks some pending patches, even for me in 
other ares, but it also creates a better foundation to work from.

As to the MC1322x support, I have read a lot of the list communications 
going back to march and also checked the Freescale manual. It seems 
MC1322x should be a fairly standard ARM7TDMI-S.  So MC1322x should work 
with OpenOCD with perhaps some configuration and startup tweaks.  The 
problem is the JLink interface, it is known to never have worked 100% .

So my suggestion for going forward is:

- Zack keeps cleaning up the code.

- Test and debug MC1322x support using a FT2232 based interface.

- Test and debug JLink code on target we have lots of experience with

- Update the jag/tap code, but this can only be done if it works with 
all already supported interfaces.

Best regards,
Magnus
