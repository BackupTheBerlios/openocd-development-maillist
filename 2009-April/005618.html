I took a deeper look into the &quot;problem&quot;.

As you already said the file is being generated when you pass
--enable-maintainer-mode to configure. That is exactly my concern. If  
you try
to build a checkout from svn you will always have to pass the option to
configure. I am just not sure if that is desirable. A solution would  
be to add
version.texi to svn. The problem here is that the rule says &lt;one must  
not add
generated files to an scm&quot;, but not doing it I am sure there will be  
many people
passing by and asking why they get an error while building openocd.

I also searched for the revision introducing the &quot;problem&quot;. It was the  
svn
revision 1463. It added AM_MAINTAINER_MODE to configure.in.

If everything stays the way it is now, it has to be documented  
somewhere. That
for building opeocd's documentation in an svn checkout, you need
--enable-maintainer-mode. That still will not help when people are not  
reading
documentation but just running ./configure; make; make install :)

And OFYI even as this does not seem to be related, I use Mac OS X  
Leopard with
autoconf 2.63 and automake 1.10.

Cheers Esden
