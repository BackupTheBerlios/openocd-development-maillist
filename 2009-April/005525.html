Jeff,  

The original patches you posted were not in a state that was suitable
for directly applying to the tree, so they were taken by Duane. 
Thereafter, the community has given time for Duane to post the changes
(finished or not).  As I write this, those have still not been posted.
I thought this was all in the public record, though I guess one might
have to read between the lines to see this full story.

This explains the lack of apparent progress on your patches; however, I
would be frustrated in your shoes too.  I will get to those changes in
time, pull them apart, and the pieces will get into the tree.  As it
stands, I seem to be in the best position to work on the J-link driver
(i.e. free time and skill), to push it through to a working state.

Certainly, we will need you to stick around long enough to help re-test
the integration of your work, _when_ that day comes.  Don't give up yet.
I will post another message to cover the fine points of these topics,
which will give my pointed perspective on these matter for the community
to consider.  I wanted to reply to you personally first as this medium
is very impersonal.  I do not want you to read that message and think it
was solely directed back at you; it most decidedly is not. :)

Cheers,

Zach
