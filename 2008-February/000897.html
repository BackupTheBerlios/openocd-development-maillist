</I>&gt;<i>db&amp;pr=2395
</I>
As I said in my other post (regarding the bkpts), this change is fine with me, 
even if it breaks existing non-GDB users of the GDB server.

But would it be a lot of trouble to make this configurable, with a default of 
return 0x0 and no error? The majority of our users certainly uses GDB, but I 
would like to preserve the existing behaviour if possible, especially as 
there's going to be a long period where people use both compliant and 
non-compliant versions of GDB (after this got fixed in GDB).

I know you're against additional configuration options, but I guess this is a 
legitimate reason for adding another one.

&gt;<i> 2. GDB has a default 2 second timeout for packets. When reading
</I>&gt;<i> large amounts of memory from the target GDB will split these
</I>&gt;<i> reads into smaller memory reads to avoid running into a
</I>&gt;<i> timeout. The default is 8191 bytes(which is *strange*). Before
</I>&gt;<i> I modified OpenOCD, this would result in 8191 *byte* reads
</I>&gt;<i> from the target(and a timeout), instead of a 8198 32 bit bulk read +
</I>&gt;<i> some byte reads. It is *crucial* to understand
</I>&gt;<i> that users of Eclipse+GDB+OpenOCD have *very* little
</I>&gt;<i> control(or even understanding) over what sort of queries
</I>&gt;<i> that go to the target. A mouseover can evaluate e.g. a
</I>&gt;<i> global array which can easily be &gt;8191 bytes. It is
</I>&gt;<i> therefore important to service 8191 byte request faster
</I>&gt;<i> than 2 seconds(achieved via bulk reads), or the user is
</I>&gt;<i> in for some nasty debugging of OpenOCD, following
</I>&gt;<i> subtle hints from Eclipse and digging up obscure
</I>&gt;<i> GDB options. Oh and this fix makes Eclipse+GDB
</I>&gt;<i> *much* snappier.
</I>
I usually had the remote timeouts increased to be able to attach a gdb to 
OpenOCD itself so I rarely noticed this. I certainly didn't ever &quot;use&quot; 
Eclipse ;). I just don't agree about the exact change, see below.

&gt;<i> 3. The GDB remote protocol does not guarantee what access type
</I>&gt;<i> is to be used. This can be achieved using &quot;monitor mwX&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> commands. To be guaranteed a certain access type &quot;monitor mwX&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> *must* be used. Currently target_read/write_buffer()
</I>&gt;<i> will not use 16 and 32 bit access for aligned single word accesses
</I>&gt;<i> and there is no particular reason not to do so. I therefore
</I>&gt;<i> suggest that GDB server should use target_read/write_buffer()
</I>&gt;<i> and that target_read/write_buffer() should be changed to guarantee
</I>&gt;<i> use of 16 and 32 bit accesses for single word accesses. NB!
</I>&gt;<i> for &gt;1 word access, target_read/write_buffer() should use
</I>&gt;<i> the fastest possible read/write, ditto for unaligned accesses,
</I>&gt;<i> this to maximize throughput.
</I>
target_read_buffer only guarantees to deliver bytes in the same order as 
they're found on the target, and it does so as fast as possible (if it 
doesn't it needs fixing).

The target-&gt;read_memory functions guarantee an access of a certain size. 
Currently that's limited to aligned accesses, but newer ARM architectures 
define unaligned accesses, too.

I don't see where we gain anything by moving some implied behaviour from the 
GDB server to the target_read_buffer function? IMHO it belongs to the GDB 
server, because we assume this is what GDB wants.

Regards,

Dominic
