<PRE>Hi list,

ok, here some test code for ARM11 in case someone else has a system to 
run this on.

The patch is against r337.

I am working on ARM1176 and there are some (minor but deadly) 
differences in the debugging compared to the ARM1136 which are not 
supported (yet). So it will probably not work on ARM1136 out of the box. 
I would fix these things if someone can do tests on actual hardware.

Due to the modifications mentioned below the patch will work only on 
FTDI interfaces.


I am testing mostly via telnet. Your mileage with GDB may vary.

1. Resets are ignored (functions not implemented). The system is halted 
in whatever state it is.

Part of the reason here is that I have no core reset capability in my 
system except from inside the core (i.e. after taking debug control) and 
that capability resets everything including DBGTAP.

2. Memory transfers in both directions should work.

3. halt, resume and step should work

4. No Breakpoints so far

5. I currently have no plans to go very far beyond the basic debug 
functionality with the implementation, as this is all what we currently 
need here.


Code for the config file (dev 0 is ETM, dev 1 is ARM1176):

jtag_device 4 0x1 0xf 0xe
jtag_device 5 0x1 0x1f 0x1e

target arm11 little reset_halt 1
run_and_halt_time 0 0



I also included some changes to the base system that might be worth 
adding. The PD-&gt;SD transition issue we discussed yesterday in 
particular. The statemove solution would only be a workaround in my case 
since it requires keeping track previous activities in my upper layer. I 
found that an not sufficiently elegant approach.



My changes:

1. I removed the unused parameter from jtag_add_ir_scan et al. This 
wasn't necessary in hindsight but anyway.

2. I added a field 'via_capture' to scan_command_t.

3. I added:

extern int jtag_add_ir_scan_vc(int num_fields, scan_field_t *fields, 
enum tap_state endstate);
extern int jtag_add_dr_scan_vc(int num_fields, scan_field_t *fields, 
enum tap_state endstate);

They do the same as the original functions but set the via_capture bit.

They will behave exactly as the normal functions except if one starts in 
PI/PD respectively.

4. I added

#define TAP_MOVE_PI_TO_SI_VIA_CI	0x1E	/* 001111. */
#define TAP_MOVE_PD_TO_SD_VIA_CD	0x1C	/* 00111.. */

to be used to deal with the via_capture scenario in the low level driver.

5. I updated the FTDI2232 driver to use these macros instead of the 
lookup table for the cases where a PI-&gt;SI or PD-&gt;SD transition is required.

6. There is an unrelated bugfix to src/server/server.c included.


Michael
