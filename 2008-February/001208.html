Thank you for taking care about this,
Unfortunately I think that --enable-presto_libftdi does not work
and I am afraid that it cannot work with libftdi as it is.
There is a possibility to fix this but for some (maybe significant) performance penalty.

The reason is following (if someone has more precise info, please correct me):

As I looked at libftdi some time ago, I found out that it as much as possible relies on
libusb, which is truly synchronous, which means call to usb_bulk_write does not
return until all data is delivered to the device (is that so? anyone want to comment on this?).
Also libusb does not fetch any data from the device until usb_bulk_read is called.

Now the problem: if a block of data containing read back commands is sent to PRESTO,
and if there are more than 384 read-backs (representing 384 bits to be shifted in),
the buffer in FTDI inside PRESTO gets full and PRESTO stops accepting any more read back commands.

In case of ftd2xx, this is not a problem, as it is multi-threaded and it reads data from the
USB device in the background and stores it in a larger buffer on the host side.

Note: I am not absolutely sure about the above - I am not an expert on libftdi, but this is
what I observed in it's sources, comments are needed about this (anyone, please?).
I suppose the lack of background read is the most limiting factor causing libftdi to perform so poorly
compared to ftd2xx

Best regards,
  Pavel
