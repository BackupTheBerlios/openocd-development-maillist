<PRE>Hi List,

 

I hope this is not a dumb question.

 

If I have a GDB script that does the following:

 

# 1. Reset processor and execute reset script

monitor reset

 

# 2. Initialise SDRAM

monitor script init_sdram_script.ocd

 

# 3. Program SDRAM

monitor load_image getting-started-project-at91sam9260.bin 0x20000000
bin 

 

Is the reset script executed asyncronously? I.e. the reset script is
started, but the next line (2) is started before (1) is completely
finished.

 

The question is this if it is true: how do I wait until a script is
completely finished, before executing the next part?

 

Best regards,

Pieter Conradie
