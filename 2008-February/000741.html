I did a quick read of the diploma thesis, and I've read the info pages 
about configuration. I've had a bit of a hard time understanding some 
parts in the info pages about the configuration, though; for example, 
it's not explained what the jtag_speed number represents--is it Mhz of 
the TCK, or what? I also thought I'd start minimally and go from there, 
I didn't expect openocd to segfault if something's missing ;). -- Thanks 
for the patch &#216;yvind, I'll test it asap.

Adding one of the above three lines has been enough to avoid the segfault.

I've also added the other directives, giving me now a configuration of 
(I changed to wiggler2 since I also added an LED and the rest of the 
parallel port pins seem to be identical to the wiggler, and using ppdev):

telnet_port 50000
daemon_startup attach
interface parport
reset_config trst_and_srst
parport_port ppdev
parport_cable wiggler2
jtag_speed 0
jtag_device 8 0x1 0x1 0xfe
jtag_device 4 0x1 0xf 0xe
jtag_device 5 0x1 0x1 0x1e
daemon_startup reset
target arm966e little reset_halt 1 arm966e
run_and_halt_time 0 30
working_area 0 0x50000000 16384 nobackup
flash bank str9x 0x00000000 0x00080000 0 0 0


When running openocd, the LED is flashing a bit, and with the 
oscilloscope I can see signal peaks (jumping between 0 and 3.3V) on all 
output lines, except for the system reset which seems not being 
triggered. But the reply line from the ARM (STR911) is silent, staying 
at about half of the voltage range (e.g. ca. 1.5 V) all the time, which 
seems like a strange voltage. I've suspected I did mistake TDO and TDI 
and have tried with resoldering changing those two. But then the reply 
line is silent at 0V. And it seemed to me that when I touch that line 
(before entering the voltage shifter) that now it was more sensitive to 
50hz signal than before, which makes me suspect that this really is an 
ARM *input*, meaning the former configuration was right.

I've got no idea what's wrong now, guesses are:

- only the 24mhz crystal for the cpu clock is oscillating (correctly at 
24mhz), the 32khz real time clock crystal is silent (could be that one 
will only come up once the cpu has initialized the rtc?); I hope that 
shouldn't be a problem for the jtag access?

- it's still a problem of the configuration. Could this be? (But why is 
the ARM pin at around 1.5V? The ARM is getting 1.8V for the cpu core, 
3.3V for the IO layer; the JTAG pins should be using the 3.3V from what 
I can tell.)

- do I have to enable JTAG access somehow? I couldn't find anything in 
the data sheet about this and there's no pin with a name like &quot;enable&quot;.

- is the ARM chip just broken? (hm, might those multi-hundred-dollar 
sockets (for LQFP80) actually be useful for something?..)

Thanks for any hints,
Christian.
