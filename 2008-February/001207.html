Can you tell me where the duplicated lines are?

&gt;<i> there is a memory leak in log_printfnl and the way va_list is used in log.c is simply wrong
</I>
Thanks for spotting that one.

&gt;<i>  (if there are multiple log callbacks the argument list is passed in a loop
</I>&gt;<i> several times, without being initialized).
</I>
This was broken for at least a year or two before I looked at OpenOCD.

I even made an attempt to fix it. However, problems
with the way the macros are defined, etc. didn't allow for doing this properly
in any obvious fashion. Once the dust settles I'll see if I can't fix
it to follow
the va_list rules.

&gt;<i>  Could you, please, do some simple checks before commiting stuff next time?
</I>&gt;<i>  I really hate when OpenOCD breaks just under my hands when working on some other part.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  What about other developers, anyone else with opinion that we shall think about consequences

</I>&gt;<i>  that there are no *fundamental* or *known* bugs which cause problems after commit.
</I>
Here I committed to hastily I agree, but there was a fair amount of stuff
to get out of the way and the intention here was that none of the other
code (from an API point of view) should be affected.

My queued up changes to OpenOCD is now very much at the end, so things
should calm down significantly from here on.

&gt;<i>  In other words I do not expect the changes to be bug free, but there shall be no *obvious* issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &#216;yvind, I can surely fix this in a few minutes, but from the changes made, I don't have a clear clue,
</I>&gt;<i>  what exactly was you aim.  If there is a partly finished job to be commited, I think it is a good idea to send some basic info
</I>&gt;<i>  about &quot;where does it go&quot; to the list. Could you please provide some explanation about where are the changes going?
</I>
This recent log change has to do with resolving the problem that it is
impossible
to let the caller of the logger/print API decide when the line endings
should happen.

<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2008-February/001103.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2008-February/001103.html</A>


&gt;<i>  Note about using malloc:
</I>&gt;<i>  We shall avoid using malloc &amp; strcpy for such tasks like adding a new line to the end of string,
</I>&gt;<i>  as I am used to embedded platforms, whete such thing is really expensive, I see it
</I>&gt;<i> as a shame to do it like that.
</I>
I don't like the malloc() myself, but a) it only happens if anything
was actually logged,
i.e. no overhead is incurred for a DEBUG() statement unless debug_level=3 b)
my main priority was not to mess around with the API.

If I can think of a way to get rid of the malloc() without messing with the
API, i'll remove it.

&gt;<i>  Wouldn't it be better to print the string and then print new line character right after that?
</I>&gt;<i>  I know that this means one more call to output function, but it is probably still better then the
</I>&gt;<i>  malloc oddity, isn't it?
</I>
That would cause headaches for the log listeners.
