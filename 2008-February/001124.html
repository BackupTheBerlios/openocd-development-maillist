I'll try to explain my concerns a bit more. It's certainly not my intention to 
hold off innovation.

You're trying to optimize the JTAG layer for your case:
- small embedded CPU
- tightly coupled FPGA

This is all fine, but not necessarily the only possible solution.

My view has always been that the developer is ultimately using a multi-GHz 
desktop machine. Resource constraints shouldn't matter, which is why the JTAG 
layer carries as much infomation as possible, even if that means to store a 
multiple of the actual data transfered via JTAG.

The ideal JTAG interface I thought about wouldn't need close coupling of the 
serializer to the controlling logic. Latency shouldn't matter to the maximum 
extend possible, which means that the JTAG interface needs to be able to 
interpret the data to/from the serializer. The latency-sensitive control 
logic usually comes down to &quot;wait for bit A to go high/low&quot; or something like 
that, which can be expressed in STAPL, a language simple enough to implement 
in hardware (not necessarily STAPL itself, but a binary representation of 
similar complexity). The PC would download descriptions of the necessary 
control flows to the JTAG interface to store them for later use. At that 
point, only data would have to flow through the interface, referencing the 
control flows that know how to handle the data.

The advantage of such an approach would be a universal JTAG interface that 
could implement all kinds of target protocols using only PC software. No 
firmware upgrades required, just a software update on your PC. No limitations 
like &quot;you can only have support for one architecture at a time&quot; or something 
like that.

These are two very different approaches. I admit that the solution I 
envisioned is rather complex, and could prove to be unrealistic to implement, 
which is why I accepted your prior changes to the JTAG layer.

Another solution could use a more potent uC coupled with a FPGA. ARM9 + lots 
of RAM isn't that expensive anymore, and much closer to a PC than your ARM7 
board. I just don't want to remove existing flexibility of the JTAG layer to 
optimize for one particular solution.

Feel free to move along on your path, as long as it doesn't change fundamental 
parts of the existing JTAG interface. The minidriver patch itself is fine 
with me.

Best regards,

Dominic
