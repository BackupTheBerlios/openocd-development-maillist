I've changed the &quot;reset halt&quot; behaviour to use a breakpoint at 0x0 prior to 
asserting nSRST which cured the problem for me. This should be working fine 
in the OpenOCD since several months.

</I>
If you don't like the closed source libftd2xx you could always have a look at 
libftdi, an open source replacement. Either way, the FT2232 doesn't support 
RTCK.
You could route RTCK to a GPIO pin (the JTAGkey might do that already, i'd 
have to check schematics), force TCK high, and wait for RTCK to go high, too 
(or low, depending on the sleep-mode state of RTCK).

But even if you know that RTCK worked when you polled it, you don't know when 
the LPC reenters sleep mode. To the JTAG layer sleep mode looks like a 
communication problem, and it's hard to tell at what point communication went 
wrong.

&gt;<i> &gt; I've also seen recommendations to disable sleep modes during JTAG
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; debugging (don't remember where...).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, now that I've pinned down the cause (and that took a while!),
</I>&gt;<i> that's always an option, but of course that's not always possible if you've

</I>&gt;<i> and still want to be able to debug a &quot;production&quot; image.
</I>
In order to completely handle this problem you'd need a way to determine 
whether the core is in sleep mode even at times where it's already stopped. 
As far as I know this isn't implemented. You'd also need a way to prevent 
entry into sleep mode, once the debugger is attached, or you'd risk lossing 
synchronization again. This, too, isn't implemented on the LPC2000 afaik.

Regards,

Dominic
