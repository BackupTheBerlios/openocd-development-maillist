Hello &#216;yvind,

&#216;yvind Harboe napsal(a):
&gt;&gt;<i>  The wafer layer is good in that it makes flash drivers more consistent,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  however, it weakens polymorphism and I don't think it is good idea to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &quot;solve&quot; this by adding another polymorphic functions - what benefit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would this bring?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Having two such layers and allowing the flash driver to override as
</I>&gt;<i> high up as it needs, is perfectly straighftforward polymorphism. In
</I>&gt;<i> fact it's precisely how polymorphism is intended to be used. I
</I>&gt;<i> don't see an issue.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Would not it be better if flash driver functions include a single line something like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  if (flash_check_halted(...)!=ERROR_OK) return ...;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  when desired? No extra polymorphism needed, just make the &quot;halted check&quot; centralized.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why are you trying to get rid of the polymorphism?
</I>
Because I believe that it is generally not a good idea to use polymorphism more than really
needed - just because of a single check for target halted. This makes flash driver API
more complex than necessary, combined with weak documentation and quick development, this is a way to hell.

Check for target halted is more case of &quot;common code among the drivers&quot;, rather than &quot;different code in each driver&quot;,
that is, it is not a typical task for polymorphism but rather for a soubroutine.

Moreover the things which belong together shall stay together, that is, if the operation
desires certain conditions which might not be always satisfied it shall check about that itself
so that it is clear what it does. Call to subroutine is more clear here rather that hiding this in the upper layer.

&gt;&gt;<i>  I have to admit that I liked the previous flash driver API more - let the driver decide.
</I>&gt;<i> And with polymorphism, you get that back.
</I>
Yes, but at cost of unnecessarily more complex API, just for 5 lines of common code.
Counterargument - what benefits brings it over the lightweight approach of calling subroutine in this particular case?
Will it be good for anything different than &quot;target halted&quot; check?
(Not in the present - if ever, and  I doubt about that.)
Why handle conditions for an operation internal to the driver in some upper layer?

The discussion is about whether we do (call graph):
1) driver_write =&gt; write =&gt; write_bottom (actual write done in &quot;write_bottom&quot;)
2) driver_write =&gt; write =&gt; check_halted_or_whatever_first (actual write done in &quot;write&quot;)

In fact, only a single function will be useful as public - that is &quot;write&quot;
It is all hidden in the driver private layer anyway, so why shall we dictate the driver to use
one more function pointer to do it's stuff?

&gt;&gt;<i>  <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2008-February/000832.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2008-February/000832.html</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  i.e. to have the default probe vs auto_probe logic in the flash layer, rather than in the driver.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Using two layers of polymorphism then?
</I>
Sorry I am still not convinced - I don't like the idea at all.
This is not object oriented programming, we are using C, which is about structured programming.
Trying to use OOP implementation techniques (build program skeleton by object hierarchy
instead of soubroutines) is not good, despite it could technically be done.
