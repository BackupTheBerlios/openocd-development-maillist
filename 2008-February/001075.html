If I understood correctly, you mean that the target shall be halted before flash
operation for any flash drivers, right?
Unfortunately, this is not always the case, at least it would break my on-chip-loader driver
I have published some months ago.

Summary of the OCL driver:
- communicates with loader code running on the target through DCC
- provides generic way to quickly implement loading of data to arbitrary device
connected to the target, not only typical flashing, e.g. FPGA configuration.
- the driver does not care about how the loader got to the target, about its address
or address of the buffer. This is typically handled by a script which ensures the loader is there and running.
Driver just expects this to be done before its operation and that is what makes is generic.

I can repost OCL driver if someone is interested, it's not perfect, but works ok, pretty handy.

Well, if your patch fixes others and breaks just OCL driver, I can change it so
that it resumes the target before communicating with the loader, indeed.
I just wanted to note that there might be an issue and maybe we will find even better solution.

Regards,
   Pavel
