Hello &#216;yvind,

&#216;yvind Harboe napsal(a):
&gt;<i> You're trying to avoid polymorphism as if it was a bad thing. This
</I>&gt;<i> adds complexity for no tangible benefit that I've seen.
</I>
Because I really mean it is a bad thing if it is unnecessary, and this is the cases.


&gt;<i> Yes. Today all the drivers are implemented correctly w/the flash_driver_xxx()
</I>&gt;<i> frontend.
</I>
This is not an argument for the change itself being good idea.


&gt;<i> There is *one* driver so far(not yet committed ;-), that needs a different
</I>&gt;<i> solution than the others. I suggest adding flash_driver_xxx() to the
</I>&gt;<i> polymorphism to allow the odd drivers to do things differently if they need to.
</I>
No offense &#216;yvind, I really don't want this to sound ironic, neither to start a flame,
but there used to be ULTIMATE and unrestricted polymorphism - until you applied the change,
which restricted how the driver shall act. And your suggestion to solve it by adding
&quot;new&quot; polymorphism - in fact at the level the previous one used to be -
this sounds really odd to me.
So that we would not restrict the driver in &quot;what to do&quot; but at the same time we would
be trying to push it &quot;how to do its internals&quot; by having another function pointer in the driver common structure, why?

This is not about whether the change breaks existing drivers or not,
this is about whether it is a good idea at all.

Let us hear opinions of other developers.


&gt;<i> However, OpenOCD isn't C/C++ and of the top of my head,  I don't have any
</I>&gt;<i> better alternative to emulating interface+base class than what's
</I>&gt;<i> described above.
</I>
As you noticed we are NOT using C++, so we shall NOT try to &quot;emulate&quot;
it by implementing things in a way which is not natural in C.
I am seeing anything bad on function pointers, I just consider
bad building skeleton of the program the OOP style, which is not
natural in C.


&gt;<i> My thinking is that OpenOCD is in agony over not having object
</I>&gt;<i> oriented programming w/interfaces, exceptions, etc. in a number of
</I>&gt;<i> places besides flash drivers. For now we have to make do without
</I>&gt;<i> and OpenOCD *already* has lots of code that more or less successfully
</I>&gt;<i> emulates oo concepts.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps OpenOCD *should* switch to *sensible* use of C/C++,
</I>&gt;<i> or perhaps staying in C is better w.r.t. the embedded audience.
</I>
This is matter of taste. Linux kernel avoids using OOP and is it in agony?
I do not think that particular programming technique determines
usability or viability of a project.
Abstraction using function pointers is very fine in C, if used on places where it makes sense.
However trying to push such techniques elsewhere of course makes a lot of pain.
That is what I am trying to say - do we really NEED another layer polymorphism
here, if there is another elegant solution?

I am strongly against adding second layer of polymorphism.
The solution I would accept would be a single function pointer to check preconditions.

Take it this way:
when doing the change you used the fact, that the &quot;target halted&quot; check was (or could be) done BEFORE
actual polymorphic code of the drivers.
What about possible similar problem where there is some common task among drivers,
but it has to be done somewhere INSIDE the driver routine, what would be the most natural solution?
Place it into subroutine, right? So what is the difference, or reason you are pushing this to
be solved &quot;the OOP style&quot;?
And that is the core of our discussion: Unless we restrict the drivers so that
the operation always starts on halted target, using a subroutine for such common check is the
most natural solution in C. And we shall use natural solutions, according to my belief.

Anyway, let us hear comments of other developers.

Regards,
   Pavel
