<PRE>Comments?

There is *lots* of stuff in the queue now. I find it very frustrating
to have to redo patches and spoonfeeding them one at the time :-)

Also I believe that with the recent progress on OpenOCD,
interest is going to pick up and we'll see even more patches
for target hardware. I think such target support patches
should be encouraged by committing them as work
in progress to trunk if they look essentially sane.

Currently patches are tested one at the time. Michael does a
full regression test for every patch he commits pretty much :-)
This yields a lot of testing overhead and slows down
synchronisation of work.

I'm thinking that we should move to using OpenOCD trunk
for work in progress, do cursory testing along the way
and more serious testing at milestones:

- define milestones(in time not features) ca. 1-3 months apart
- commit work in progress if it compiles, looks good
and passes some quick smoketesting and there is
a consensus about the direction. This is svn so backing
out a change is not a problem. Stuff removed from
trunk does not disappear, it's still in SVN.
- stuff that can leave trunk broken for weeks
should be handled in a development branch. Patches
can be used between developers for stuff that would
leave trunk broken for days.
- it is more important that developers are in sync
than that what's in trunk is working at any one
moment in time. If a bug sneaks in, then it should
be expected to be fixed within days.
- a branch is created from a milestone and fixes
are applied to that branch if necessary. Development
in trunk runs continiously without holding off commits
because a milestone is coming up
- use a testing matrix at milestones(minimally):
