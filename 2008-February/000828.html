Can you be a little more specific? I don't really understand what you
mean by 'Device programmers'. Is this covering the following:

 - JTAG interface hardware, such as an FTDI or Parallel port wiggler
 - A JTAG core driver, such as ARM9, XScale, etc.
 - A flash programming interface such as NAND.

I'm sorta guessing here you mean JTAG interface hardware.
 
&gt;<i> Here are some points to consider:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - no device programmers should be favoured  over the other by OpenOCD
</I>&gt;<i> - the number of device programmers is likely to grow as OpenOCD incrases in
</I>&gt;<i> popularity
</I>&gt;<i> - who's responsible for regression testing once a device programmer is supported
</I>&gt;<i> by OpenOCD?
</I>
Ideally this would the original authour, but in some cases they vanish, or
the company changes hands, and the information is lost. At least if there
is source out there which has worked, it can make the job of fixing the
thing easier.

&gt;<i> - it gets harder to move forward as more device programmers are in OpenOCD
</I>&gt;<i> svn
</I>
A policy of fix it, or face it being removed is probably the best policy
here. If it simple does not compile anymore, then there should be an request
to fix it (to list and original authour(s)) with a given period to say
'fix this, or we will remove the code'.

&gt;<i> - if a device programmer implements a hw layer in an FPGA, then that FPGA bit
</I>&gt;<i> file won't ship with the source(it makes little sense), so at that point the
</I>&gt;<i> driver is pretty uninteresting to anyone else as well.
</I>
It depends, the binary firmware might be proprietary, but the vendor
publish the register interface.

PS, Word wrapping to 70ish characters a line would make this much easier to
read when using a text editor (yes, some of still user a _terminal_ to
read our email!)
 
&gt;<i> A tentative policy here(I'm not dead set on these guidelines, but it
</I>&gt;<i> seems easier
</I>&gt;<i> to write up some specific rules than to dig out some more abstract
</I>&gt;<i> principles :-):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - OpenOCD should gravitate towards being a JTAG library that device
</I>&gt;<i> programmers can
</I>&gt;<i> use, but system implemention and testing  ultimately rests upon those that ship
</I>&gt;<i> device programmers.
</I>
I'm not so sure about this one. Having a view of the likely hardware
drivers is probably useful to anyone deciding to make changes elsewhere
as they can see what is likely to be using them.

A second thing is, that having the drivers packaged with the source means
that they get moved along if the jtag core gets changed. There's nothing
worse than getting n versions of OpenOCDlib and m vendor drivers just
because you've got several different types of JTAG hardware around.

&gt;<i> - OpenOCD should focus more on targets and less on the JTAG bit as time goes on
</I>&gt;<i> and the JTAG library ceases to change.
</I>&gt;<i> - A few device programmers that are useful to the community in terms
</I>&gt;<i> of *testing*
</I>&gt;<i> the core of OpenOCD should remain part of OpenOCD
</I>&gt;<i> - If nobody tests a device programmer regularly, it should be removed
</I>&gt;<i> from OpenOCD.
</I>&gt;<i> This is essentially the same policy that GCC has. They retire target
</I>&gt;<i> support when nobody
</I>&gt;<i> tests it anymore.
</I>
I think I agree with this one (see above), as long as there is a policy
and someone to implement it.

&gt;<i> - OpenOCD should be linked with the device programmer software, i.e. no binary
</I>&gt;<i> API exists to OpenOCD library(this could be done long term, but it's a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of work).
</I>&gt;<i> - The jtag_xxx() layer is now *much* more friendly towards being
</I>&gt;<i> implemented entirely
</I>&gt;<i> by a device programmer. This allows for innovation w.r.t.
</I>&gt;<i> acceleration/implementation
</I>&gt;<i> by letting the device programmers implement the entire jtag_xxx()
</I>&gt;<i> layer in hw+sw.
</I>&gt;<i> Still some work to be done here, but it's pretty decent right now.
</I>
