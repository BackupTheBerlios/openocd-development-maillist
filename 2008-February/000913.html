<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   by confusing the user with the details here and OpenOCD 
</I>&gt;<i> developers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   are acutely aware of the problem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am going to perform a few tests on this one today, but to 
</I>&gt;<i> be honest 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have never come across it. Or had any reports from customers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; At the moment it seems adding this by default would break 
</I>&gt;<i> gdb for more 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people than not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The above seems contradictionary. A workaround for a bug you 
</I>&gt;<i> have never observed will break people?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to see some evidence.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
What i mean is returning success for a data abort has lots of other effects.
We have discussed this before, what about all the other reads gdb performs.
The user will get a good result even if a data abort was received - this is
what i mean by breaking gdb.
I have no issue with your fix except for when the above case.

&gt;<i> GDB embedded developers are used to putting up with a lot of quirks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How do you know they they a) understand the problem they are seing
</I>&gt;<i> b) are not just putting up with it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It took me a while to figure out why Eclipse was sluggish 
</I>&gt;<i> when I dragged the mouse over code and why it sometimes would 
</I>&gt;<i> just terminate for no apparent reason. It takes a keen eye!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - *much* faster read/write GDB packets, removing timeout problems.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - GDB read/write packets w/single word aligned 32/16 bit access
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   now use 32/16 bit word access.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This was already the behaviour, it has just been moved to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; target_read/write_buffer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To be more precise: it's now faster while retaining the 32/16 
</I>&gt;<i> bit access.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I don't want to get in a debate with you, the code i committed on sat
performed a target_read/write_buffer for any access over 4 bytes. So for
large transfers the code paths are pretty much the same.

I am happy with the changes howver, as it cleans up the
target_read/write_buffer functions.

Cheers
Spen
