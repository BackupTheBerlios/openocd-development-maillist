Hello Spen, &#216;yvind and the list!

This has been discussed already, please search back through the list history.
Some drivers (may) need certain specific prerequisites, e.g. clock settings, target (not) running etc...

&gt;<i> Keeping it in is fine with me, just having a hard time understanding why
</I>&gt;<i> something like the following could not be added to flash.c
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> int flash_auto_probe(struct flash_bank_s *bank)

</I>&gt;<i> 	int retval;
</I>&gt;<i> 	
</I>&gt;<i> 	if (bank-&gt;probed)
</I>&gt;<i> 		return ERROR_OK;
</I>&gt;<i> 	bank-&gt;probed = 0;
</I>&gt;<i> 	if ((retval = bank-&gt;driver-&gt;probe(bank)) == ERROR_OK)
</I>&gt;<i> 		bank-&gt;probed = 1;
</I>&gt;<i> 	return retval;
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>
Generally not bad, but I would slightly modify it:

int flash_auto_probe(struct flash_bank_s *bank)
{
	if (bank-&gt;probed)
		return ERROR_OK;
	if (bank-&gt;driver-&gt;autoprobe==NULL)
		return ERROR_FLASH_BANK_NOT_PROBED;
  	return bank-&gt;driver-&gt;autoprobe(bank);
}

Comments:
1) If bank-&gt;probed is true just return, otherwise there is no need to set it to zero (as it already is).
2) Check whether autoprobing is supported/implemented by the driver at all.
3) Do not call normal probe but autoprobe so that the driver knows whether probing was induced explicitly
or automatically and issue a warning or whatever if it does not support autoprobing or need specific conditions.
4) let the drivers probe/autoprobe function decide on its own whether it sets bank-&gt;probed.
This would allow the autoprobe to be called every time flash is accessed not just once (if desired, drivers choice).
5) The drivers probe/autoprobe functions would be responsible for setting (or resetting) bank-&gt;probed variable.
6) No other code but this one should rely on bank-&gt;probed nor set it, it is intended just for autoprobing and
driver internals (if applicable).

This would provide enough flexibility for any real scenario I can imagine, while not pushing the drivers
to reimplement the same stuff over and over.
I support the idea to have the &quot;probed&quot; variable in the bank struct as such state variable is (in certain form)
typically used by most of the drivers anyway, with similar conditional probing as in the code snippet above.

For drivers which do not care about any special prerequisites for probing it would be trivial to implement autoprobe
just as a call to regular probe, or even better, to initialize bank-&gt;autoprobe with pointer to regular probe routine,
no additional function or state variable in the driver required!
Sounds good?

Regards,
   Pavel
