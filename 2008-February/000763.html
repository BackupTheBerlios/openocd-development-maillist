<PRE>Hi &#216;yvind and Dominic,

The problem disappeared after applying the patch.

I did a cursory check for memory corruption by inspecting the &quot;reg&quot; structure (on the unpatched code).

The content appears valid (reg-&gt;dirty = 1; reg-&gt;valid = 0,...). See attached picture (remove &quot;1&quot; suffix from filename; used to bypass blocking of images)

Best regards,
Pieter

P.S. Sorry about sending it again, I had to change the image from a BMP to a JPG to get under the 100k forum e-mail limit.

How's this patch?

It changes all the sites that set the dirty bit, presumably wanting to
flush a valid register, with code that sets the dirty bit only
if the register is valid. The code also clears the dirty bit if the
register is not valid.

Perhaps this will fix the problem, but it could also fix+hide an underlying
problem, in which case asserts(or OpenOCD's equivalent) could
be a good way to go. Assert's also document the code, in that
it shows what assumptions are being made. Clearly the
patch above and assertions are not mutually exclusive.

If the patch does not fix(or hide) the problem, then I suspect memory
corruption or initialisation problems based upon my code inspection.
