Hello &#216;yvind and the list,

&#216;yvind, no offense, but your recent commits have terribly broken the logging and output subsystem.
I can see duplicated new lines in the configuration output, there is a memory leak in
log_printfnl and the way va_list is used in log.c is simply wrong
(if there are multiple log callbacks the argument list is passed in a loop several times, without being initialized).

Could you, please, do some simple checks before commiting stuff next time?
I really hate when OpenOCD breaks just under my hands when working on some other part.

What about other developers, anyone else with opinion that we shall think about consequences
before commiting? I agree that developers shall be kept in sync, but care shall be taken
that there are no *fundamental* or *known* bugs which cause problems after commit.

In other words I do not expect the changes to be bug free, but there shall be no *obvious* issues.

&#216;yvind, I can surely fix this in a few minutes, but from the changes made, I don't have a clear clue,
what exactly was you aim.  If there is a partly finished job to be commited, I think it is a good idea to send some basic info
about &quot;where does it go&quot; to the list. Could you please provide some explanation about where are the changes going?

Note about using malloc:
We shall avoid using malloc &amp; strcpy for such tasks like adding a new line to the end of string,
as I am used to embedded platforms, whete such thing is really expensive, I see it as a shame to do it like that.

Wouldn't it be better to print the string and then print new line character right after that?
I know that this means one more call to output function, but it is probably still better then the
malloc oddity, isn't it?

Best regards,
Pavel
