Hello,

&#216;yvind Harboe napsal(a):
&gt;&gt;<i>  1) pre-driver phase: ensure that the driver function is always called with sane parameters,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  that is, it shall handle out of range sectors BEFORE calling the driver.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem as Dominic pointed out is that polymorphism is intended
</I>&gt;<i> to let the driver decide what's sane parameters :-)
</I>
By &quot;sane&quot; parameters I mean what is really common among the drivers, currently probably only
sector ranges for write/erase (not protect!), nothing else.
Note: It might be wise to change the issue in the protection.

&gt;&gt;<i>  2) post-driver phase: check the error code returned by driver and print out an error message
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  (as it presently does) - possibly with some explanation what the return code means
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's not what it does. The wraper *ammends* information to an already existing
</I>&gt;<i> ERROR(). The ERROR() is reported at the very lowest level.
</I>
Sure, let it keep it like that, but sometimes it ammends to *nothing* (that is a fact of present state).

&gt;<i> ERROR()'s should be reported where the error is detecte. Code sharing
</I>&gt;<i> can be achieved by having a checking fn that invokes ERROR()s.
</I>&gt;<i> The driver remains in control of *what* should be checked.
</I>&gt;<i> Looks like were narrowing in on having a single polymorphic method
</I>&gt;<i> and the drivers invoke checking fn's that report ERROR()s?
</I>
Not at all. The checks might be spread across flash programing algorithm -
also in the middle of the process, si is does not help anything to use polymorphism here,
driver operations are blackboxes which say ok or error.
We cannot assume anything particular about them, which means, not to prescribe them the methods they should use.

Anyway, why should the upper layer care about whether the error in the driver was caused by missing precondition
or problem during the process itself? The result is the same in the end.
I believe there is no doubt that error checking itself is private to the driver,
so it does not make sense to call it from the upper layer, which means - no reason for polymorphism here.
(Not arguing about shared code, there may be common functions, but this is for next round, we need the flashing to
get fixed first.)

Pavel
