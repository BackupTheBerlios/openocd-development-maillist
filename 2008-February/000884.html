Well, the GDB remote serial protocol says that it's fine for a [zZ] packet to 
return an error. Could you explain what's wrong with refusing to place a 
breakpoint that way?

&gt;<i> Today the user gets completely intelligeble error messages when

Yeah, this is definitely a problem. But that means we need better error 
reporting, not different default behaviours, or some sort of automatism.

&gt;<i> I don't want to reduce flexibility, but the common case must be

</I>
I really don't think it's any good to simply try and hide the complex issues 
involved with breakpoints.

Consider the case of startup code that enables SDRAM, then copies the 
remaining code there, before jumping into SDRAM. If the breakpoint is 
requested after SDRAM is enabled (or maybe after a soft-reset, that never 
acutally disabled SDRAM), but before the code is copied. Placing the 
auto-breakpoint you suggested would succeed, but it would be overwritten 
before it triggers.

A user should know about the type of breakpoint he's working with.

Anyway, if you really think we need a simplified behaviour I expect not to 
loose any of the flexibility I now have, and that includes:

- being able to use software and hardware breakpoints at the same time
- being able to explicitly specify the kind of breakpoint, no matter what any 
automatism thinks is &quot;right&quot;
- being able to force the use of hardware breakpoints, for example for use 
with Insight, were placing a breakpoint via the GUI inevitably results in a 
software breakpoint (at least it used to - I suppose this is still true?)

&gt;<i> - retire &quot;arm7_9 hw_bkpts&quot; and &quot;arm7_9 force_hw_bkpts&quot; and 
</I>&gt;<i> replace with &quot;arm7_9 breakpoint &lt;auto/hard/soft&gt;&quot;. auto is default
</I>
arm7_9 sw_bkpts (I suppose that's what you meant) is only required on ARMv4 
targets - ARMv5 targets include the BKPT instruction.
How would you go about enabling the use of sw bkpts on ARMv4 if we removed 
this command?

breakmode [hard|soft|auto] clearly results in reduced flexibility.

Best regards,

Dominic
