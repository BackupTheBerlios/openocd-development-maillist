</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds like a good idea. We could keep a plain text file with names of

</I>&gt;<i> the interest of vendors to keep their interfaces tested, but a lack of

</I>&gt;<i> JTAG layer.
</I>
It shouldn't matter who tests &amp; submits patches. Doesn't have to
be the vendor. Ditto for targets.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; - it gets harder to move forward as more device programmers are in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; OpenOCD svn
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; There've been only few changes to the core JTAG layer, mainly your recent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; patches, in quite some time. I don't think there will be (and should be)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; too
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; many changes to this part once we've settled on an API that suits every
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; currently implemented programmer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've still got some in store. We've implemented the entire jtag_xxx()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; layer as I mentioned and this requires that the jtag_xxx() functions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be defined a bit more precisely. E.g. we've implemented a hw fifo
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rather than a sw fifo. Makes all the difference for OpenOCD running
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on ARM7.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, but even if there are more patches to come from your side, this isn't a
</I>&gt;<i> thing that's going on for all time, i.e. at some point we'll have an
</I>&gt;<i> interface that allows for such implementations, and this is going to be the
</I>&gt;<i> most complex interface in use with the OpenOCD for quite some time.
</I>
Yup. It's almost there I'd say.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - if a device programmer implements a hw layer in an FPGA, then that FPGA
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; bit file won't ship with the source(it makes little sense), so at that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; point the driver is pretty uninteresting to anyone else as well.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; One could argue that even the interface between the FPGA and OpenOCD's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; JTAG
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; layer is interesting for anyone who's working on something similar - I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; for one would love to know how you're going to implement this ;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Currently it's a bit messy and I prefer to submit patches to sharpen
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OpenOCD jtag_xxx() layer than to present the current stuff which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is a bit messy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Heh, yeah, I didn't mean to imply that you should release this stuff now.
</I>
We're releasing it *before* we distribute binaries. I even slice it into small
palatable pieces for the list!!!! :-) Our product isn't done yet,
but we're now pretty happy with OpenOCD stability at this point.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; See above - in the spirit of free software I don't see why we shouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; try to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; include support for each and every programmer that can be used together
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the OpenOCD.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To me this is a testing problem and not a free software problem. GPL
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; handles the rest :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right. The rules you mention in the next paragraph should take care of this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; - If nobody tests a device programmer regularly, it should be removed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; from OpenOCD.  This is essentially the same policy that GCC has. They
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; retire
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; target support when nobody tests it anymore.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Definitely a good idea. Guess we can be pretty liberal about this as long
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; driver in &quot;hibernation&quot; doesn't break compilation, but ultimately it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; be removed if noone tests and fixes it. I'm thinking about months here?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We could just commit a list of what targets &amp; devices that have been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tested(last tested OpenOCD revision). As long as it doesn't break
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compilation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and isn't bothersome, leave it in there. Obviously a target or device that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hasn't been tested in two years probably isn't going to work, but then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it's possible to revert to last tested version for said combination. If a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; device/target is retired, but is awoken from hiberanation by development &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fresh testing, merge it back into main trunk.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds like a good idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; - OpenOCD should be linked with the device programmer software, i.e. no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; binary API exists to OpenOCD library(this could be done long term, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; it's a lot of work).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Not completely sure what you mean here?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's possible to define a binary API such that it would be unecessary to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; link OpenOCD w/device programmer app, this would allow a) release of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OpenOCD without re-releasing drivers b) non-GPL programs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to use OpenOCD as a library. I don't think either is very important
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as a device + openocd combination needs to be retested anyway and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at that point one might as well ship a single binary (+ sources obviously).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed.
</I>&gt;<i>
