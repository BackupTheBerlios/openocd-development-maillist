<PRE>Should OpenOCD have support for fewer or more device programmers out of the box?
(I.e. committed to OpenOCD SVN trunk).

My current thinking is fewer rather than more.


Here are some points to consider:

- no device programmers should be favoured  over the other by OpenOCD
- the number of device programmers is likely to grow as OpenOCD incrases in
popularity
- who's responsible for regression testing once a device programmer is supported
by OpenOCD?
- it gets harder to move forward as more device programmers are in OpenOCD
svn
- if a device programmer implements a hw layer in an FPGA, then that FPGA bit
file won't ship with the source(it makes little sense), so at that point the
driver is pretty uninteresting to anyone else as well.

A tentative policy here(I'm not dead set on these guidelines, but it
seems easier
to write up some specific rules than to dig out some more abstract
principles :-):

- OpenOCD should gravitate towards being a JTAG library that device
programmers can
use, but system implemention and testing  ultimately rests upon those that ship
device programmers.
- OpenOCD should focus more on targets and less on the JTAG bit as time goes on
and the JTAG library ceases to change.
- A few device programmers that are useful to the community in terms
of *testing*
the core of OpenOCD should remain part of OpenOCD
- If nobody tests a device programmer regularly, it should be removed
from OpenOCD.
This is essentially the same policy that GCC has. They retire target
support when nobody
tests it anymore.
- OpenOCD should be linked with the device programmer software, i.e. no binary
API exists to OpenOCD library(this could be done long term, but it's a
lot of work).
- The jtag_xxx() layer is now *much* more friendly towards being
implemented entirely
by a device programmer. This allows for innovation w.r.t.
acceleration/implementation
by letting the device programmers implement the entire jtag_xxx()
layer in hw+sw.
Still some work to be done here, but it's pretty decent right now.
