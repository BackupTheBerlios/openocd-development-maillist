<PRE>[Lots of feedback where I have no further comments deleted]

Perhaps a test plan w/a requirement of feedback to
keep status as &quot;tested&quot;?

Anything that is &quot;tested&quot; can stay in OpenOCD trunk. Doesn't
matter who tests. OpenOCD maintainers should feel no
obligation to regression test a particular interface they
don't have a particular interest in.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - it gets harder to move forward as more device programmers are in
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; svn
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There've been only few changes to the core JTAG layer, mainly your recent
</I>&gt;<i> patches, in quite some time. I don't think there will be (and should be)
</I>&gt;<i> too
</I>&gt;<i> many changes to this part once we've settled on an API that suits every
</I>&gt;<i> currently implemented programmer.
</I>

I've still got some in store. We've implemented the entire jtag_xxx()
layer as I mentioned and this requires that the jtag_xxx() functions
be defined a bit more precisely. E.g. we've implemented a hw fifo
rather than a sw fifo. Makes all the difference for OpenOCD running
on ARM7.


&gt;<i> - if a device programmer implements a hw layer in an FPGA, then that FPGA
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bit file won't ship with the source(it makes little sense), so at that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; point the driver is pretty uninteresting to anyone else as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One could argue that even the interface between the FPGA and OpenOCD's
</I>&gt;<i> JTAG
</I>&gt;<i> layer is interesting for anyone who's working on something similar - I for
</I>&gt;<i> one would love to know how you're going to implement this ;)
</I>

Currently it's a bit messy and I prefer to submit patches to sharpen
OpenOCD jtag_xxx() layer than to present the current stuff which
is a bit messy.


&gt;<i> See above - in the spirit of free software I don't see why we shouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> try to
</I>&gt;<i> include support for each and every programmer that can be used together
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> the OpenOCD.
</I>

To me this is a testing problem and not a free software problem. GPL
handles the rest :-)



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - If nobody tests a device programmer regularly, it should be removed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from OpenOCD.  This is essentially the same policy that GCC has. They
</I>&gt;<i> retire
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; target support when nobody tests it anymore.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Definitely a good idea. Guess we can be pretty liberal about this as long
</I>&gt;<i> as a
</I>&gt;<i> driver in &quot;hibernation&quot; doesn't break compilation, but ultimately it
</I>&gt;<i> should
</I>&gt;<i> be removed if noone tests and fixes it. I'm thinking about months here?
</I>

We could just commit a list of what targets &amp; devices that have been
tested(last tested OpenOCD revision). As long as it doesn't break
compilation
and isn't bothersome, leave it in there. Obviously a target or device that
hasn't been tested in two years probably isn't going to work, but then
it's possible to revert to last tested version for said combination. If a
device/target is retired, but is awoken from hiberanation by development &amp;
fresh testing, merge it back into main trunk.


&gt;<i> &gt; - OpenOCD should be linked with the device programmer software, i.e. no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; binary API exists to OpenOCD library(this could be done long term, but
</I>&gt;<i> it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a lot of work).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not completely sure what you mean here?
</I>

It's possible to define a binary API such that it would be unecessary to
link
OpenOCD w/device programmer app, this would allow a) release of
OpenOCD without re-releasing drivers b) non-GPL programs
to use OpenOCD as a library. I don't think either is very important
as a device + openocd combination needs to be retested anyway and
at that point one might as well ship a single binary (+ sources obviously).


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - The jtag_xxx() layer is now *much* more friendly towards being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implemented entirely by a device programmer. This allows for innovation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; w.r.t. acceleration/implementation  by letting the device programmers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implement the entire jtag_xxx() layer in hw+sw.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Still some work to be done here, but it's pretty decent right now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not completely convinced here. It's probably easier to implement on
</I>&gt;<i> low-latency links, but shifting more work towards the in_handler doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> seem
</I>&gt;<i> to be something that could be easily offloaded to hardware. The code now
</I>&gt;<i> relies even more on the ability of the CPU to tightly control operation.
</I>

The in_handler stuff as is now is easier to implement, which makes
implementing
the entire jtag_xxx layer cleaner. Performance was not an issue or
consideration here.
