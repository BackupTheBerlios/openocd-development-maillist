Ah, with srst_pulls_trst set, at least for LPC2xxx, that won't work - all
hardware breakpoints are lost on reset.

</I>
Okay, it's good to eliminate that. (I wonder why the Ronetix PEEDI didn't
work though, hmm).

&gt;<i> But even if you know that RTCK worked when you polled it, you don't know when 
</I>&gt;<i> the LPC reenters sleep mode. To the JTAG layer sleep mode looks like a 
</I>&gt;<i> communication problem, and it's hard to tell at what point communication went

</I>
True.

&gt;<i> In order to completely handle this problem you'd need a way to determine 
</I>&gt;<i> whether the core is in sleep mode even at times where it's already stopped. 
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I know this isn't implemented. You'd also need a way to prevent 
</I>&gt;<i> entry into sleep mode, once the debugger is attached, or you'd risk lossing 
</I>&gt;<i> synchronization again. This, too, isn't implemented on the LPC2000 afaik.
</I>
Yep, looks like I'm on a hiding to nothing here then. It was worth a shot,
thanks for the replies.
