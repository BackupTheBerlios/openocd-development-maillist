Hello list,

here is a patch doing some cleanups and polishing:

1) log_printfv replaced by log_puts, the formatting is done in log_printf and log_printf_lf
(formerly log_printfnl - renamed to better indicate what it does, i.e. adds a line feed characted)

2) no more malloc and strcpy just because for adding new line. I have spotted that alloc_printf,
by principle has a nice side effect of allocating at least one more character than used by the returned string.
This is used to append '\n' to the end of it by simply calling strcat, if needed.
This is technically perfect but needs proper comments on places where this is used,
otherwise it might look like an allocation bug - in fact it it not. Proper comments placed wherever applicable.

3) some small polishing of alloc_printf, no need for the &quot;first&quot; variable

4) log macros not adding new line at the end now have _N suffix, which resembles &quot;echo -n&quot;
removed unnecessary do-while statements in the macro

5) log callback function are now given already formatted string (except of function name, line number, etc., of course)
logging now works &quot;single formatting, multiple output&quot;, there is no need to pass variable argument list anymore.

6) telnet_outputline now does not alter the string given to it for its own purposes - which is generally
considered a bad behavior a was corrected. Prototype changed to use const pointer.
Changed prototype of telnet_write to also use const pointer.

7) gdb_output_con now check for NULL pointer after malloc

Summary: passing of variable argument list reduced, strings sent to logging are now formatted just once - more efficient.
As a result, ugly string malloc+strcpy are not needed anymore.

If there are no objections, please commit.
Several files affected, hope there are no conflicts.

Pavel
