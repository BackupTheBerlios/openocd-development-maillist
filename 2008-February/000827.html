<PRE>Hello List,

if OpenOCD should support every hardware even it is only available one
time in the world, it should be all-important that we need a test plan.

Here a short description what I have done in the past:

I have tested with my small examples which I have create for the beginners
to test if the setup of the toolchain and OpenOCD is working correct.

I use the following targets (STR710, SAM7S256, SAM7X256, LPC2148, LPC2292/4
AT91R40008 and STR910) to check if debugging in RAM is working. Some days
before I have used Insight too. But in the last time I use only Eclipse.
The focus here was debugging in RAM, but in the last time, with the new
feature
of program the flash with GDB, I am testing this function too. Start
debugging
stop, set breakpoints and so one. Both in RAM and Flash. After this I try to
use the telnet interface to write into the internal/external Flash. This was
done
with a test file (write_image bin). Even some tests with flash erase and
protect,
and so on.

Here we have some &quot;black holes&quot; too which was not tested. What I will say we
need
a test plan where all the others, we new hardware, can check if it works
with OpenOCD.

It could be possible that a focus of a hardware ist not the debugging, it is
programming the flash. But in this case the debugging part should be tested
too.
Otherwise if the focus on debugging the hw should be tested with flash
programming.

How should we handle if the hw distributor had only one target? It is
possible what
we have seen in the past the STR710 is working but failed/broken for example
on a STR912.

I think we need a matrix where the user can see what targets was tested, and
what target
not. I have seen a question on the Sparkfun list about a problem of the
XScale. But I think
the XScale is in beta state? Even the user should have access to the test
plan / results,
to know what is tested and so on.

Hey, what do you think List?

Best regards,

Michael
