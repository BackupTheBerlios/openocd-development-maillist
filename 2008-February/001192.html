Hello all,

as the result of previous communication with &#216;yvind and Dominic,
I believe, that we finally agreed that implicit test for target being halted before
flash operations in the wrapper is wrong.

Hence here is a patch:

1) The wrappers stay there, but all they currently do is printing error message - just a generic one as it was,
not as a replacement for in place error reporting in the driver.

2) The wrapper cannot check even sector ranges - this does not work for stellaris,
which does not use bank-&gt;num_sectors, but rather is private data. Similarly this applies to
number of lockbits (flash protection) in at91sam7. Some of the drivers even rely on even lower layer
(flash controller, ROM code) in this (lpc2000).

3) I have checked all the drivers and if they require target being halted, the check for it
is included on all necessary driver entry points. Maximal care was taken not to change other functionality
of the code. Comments in some sources were formated to use C /* */ style.

4) In case of stellaris and tms470, the patch also changes auto_probe a bit, removes &quot;probed&quot; variable
which keeps unnecessary more state information than needed. Despite using probe variable may seem
more easy to read than &quot;native test&quot; for flash already probed, such redundant
state information is evil once it gets out of sync with the rest, that's the reason for its removal.

Note: The changes are rather minimal, just to make it work with minimum patch noise
(plus some polishing of spotted things), nothing else.
This means no common code for error handling/reporting in the drives was introduced so far,
this is for possible next round.

Any objections?

Pavel
