Hello &#216;yvind and the list,

&#216;yvind Harboe napsal(a):
&gt;<i> I'm OK with keeping the polymorphism the way it was, i.e. pushing
</I>&gt;<i> the checks into the driver but then using shared code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The drivers were broken before because the implementation of the
</I>&gt;<i> checks was &quot;spotty&quot;, so placing this code in a common place for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 90% of the cases is what I believe is cruicial point for quality here.
</I>
concerning the previous discussion:

I have checked the drivers and most of them in most of the functions already do proper checks
for target halted and return an error code.
The idea is (and originally probably was) that the driver shall check the preconditions
as it knows the best its needs. This applies also for other preconditions, not only halted state of the target.

Particularly, the check for the halted state of the target is basically two lines of code
if (bank-&gt;target-&gt;state != TARGET_HALTED)
	return ERROR_TARGET_NOT_HALTED;
so I do not think it would be any helpful to create a separate function for this particular check,
at least for now - there would be no gain by this, the code would not get any shorter neither more readable.
(As I stated, most of the functions already contain this check, so there won't be many changes)

However the driver shall never issue an error message in case of such generic error,
this is a task for the wrapper.
Generally speaking, driver shall print out messages only in special device dependent error
situations and just return an error code in all generic cases and stay rather silent.

The wrapper shall check for possible error states common to all drivers,
before calling the driver function (e.g. whether sector numbers are out of range)
and ensure that the driver function is called with sane parameters.
Drivers may/shall rely on the wrapper in this.

I am going to look through ALL of the flash drivers in the repository thoroughly
and make sure that proper check are done everywhere it is necessary and proper
error code is returned, unless there are some more comments or ideas (?).

I will post the patch at once when it is all complete, so please hold back
larger changes to flash drivers if possible - to prevent conflicts.

Thanks and best regards,
   Pavel
