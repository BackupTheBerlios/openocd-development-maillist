Currently I'm open to including every programmer that's actively maintained. 
The community certainly can't handle integration for a vendor, but ideally 
the JTAG layer shouldn't change very often, keeping the work of actively 
working on a foreign driver to a minimum.

&gt;<i> Here are some points to consider:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - no device programmers should be favoured  over the other by OpenOCD
</I>
Definitely, but that could be achieved by being open about integration of any 
programmer as well.

&gt;<i> - the number of device programmers is likely to grow as OpenOCD incrases in
</I>&gt;<i> popularity
</I>
Which would be a good thing imho.

&gt;<i> - who's responsible for regression testing once a device programmer is
</I>&gt;<i> supported by OpenOCD?
</I>
We're going to need a maintainer scheme for this, especially as it's getting 
difficult if not impossible for one person to have access to all supported 
programmers.
The minium requirement would be a valid email address of the person who 
originally submitted the patch subscribed to the list (or a low-volume 
announcements list) and an entry in the AUTHORS file, along with appropriate 
copyright notices.

&gt;<i> - it gets harder to move forward as more device programmers are in OpenOCD
</I>&gt;<i> svn
</I>
There've been only few changes to the core JTAG layer, mainly your recent 
patches, in quite some time. I don't think there will be (and should be) too 
many changes to this part once we've settled on an API that suits every 
currently implemented programmer.

&gt;<i> - if a device programmer implements a hw layer in an FPGA, then that FPGA
</I>&gt;<i> bit file won't ship with the source(it makes little sense), so at that
</I>&gt;<i> point the driver is pretty uninteresting to anyone else as well.
</I>
One could argue that even the interface between the FPGA and OpenOCD's JTAG 
layer is interesting for anyone who's working on something similar - I for 
one would love to know how you're going to implement this ;)

&gt;<i> A tentative policy here(I'm not dead set on these guidelines, but it
</I>&gt;<i> seems easier to write up some specific rules than to dig out some more 
</I>&gt;<i> abstract principles :-): 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - OpenOCD should gravitate towards being a JTAG library that device
</I>&gt;<i> programmers can use, but system implemention and testing  ultimately rests 
</I>&gt;<i> upon those that ship device programmers. 
</I>&gt;<i> - OpenOCD should focus more on targets and less on the JTAG bit as time
</I>&gt;<i> goes on and the JTAG library ceases to change.
</I>&gt;<i> - A few device programmers that are useful to the community in terms
</I>&gt;<i> of *testing* the core of OpenOCD should remain part of OpenOCD
</I>
See above - in the spirit of free software I don't see why we shouldn't try to 
include support for each and every programmer that can be used together with 
the OpenOCD.

There are of course some minimum requirements - in the past I refused to 
include support for a &quot;driver&quot; that relayed all OpenOCD commands through a 
socket interface to overcome GPL requirements. Everything that hides 
implementation details in a binary blackbox are problematic for me.

I suppose your message partly refers to Peer's posting about Galep5 support. 
He contacted me last week about integrating support for the Galep devices in 
the OpenOCD, and I told him that this would be fine with me, as long as he 
tried to make sure that all the access libraries got released under the terms 
of the GPL within a reasonable timeframe (several months maybe?), which is 
something I expect from every vendor, otherwise he'd be violating the GPL.

My position on this is a bit inspired by the linux kernel - they're open to 
including driver code for every device, even if it's only used on one 
particular machine in the world.

&gt;<i> - If nobody tests a device programmer regularly, it should be removed
</I>&gt;<i> from OpenOCD.  This is essentially the same policy that GCC has. They retire 
</I>&gt;<i> target support when nobody tests it anymore. 
</I>
Definitely a good idea. Guess we can be pretty liberal about this as long as a 
driver in &quot;hibernation&quot; doesn't break compilation, but ultimately it should 
be removed if noone tests and fixes it. I'm thinking about months here?

&gt;<i> - OpenOCD should be linked with the device programmer software, i.e. no
</I>&gt;<i> binary API exists to OpenOCD library(this could be done long term, but it's
</I>&gt;<i> a lot of work).
</I>
Not completely sure what you mean here?

&gt;<i> - The jtag_xxx() layer is now *much* more friendly towards being
</I>&gt;<i> implemented entirely by a device programmer. This allows for innovation 
</I>&gt;<i> w.r.t. acceleration/implementation  by letting the device programmers 
</I>&gt;<i> implement the entire jtag_xxx() layer in hw+sw. 
</I>&gt;<i> Still some work to be done here, but it's pretty decent right now. 
</I>
I'm not completely convinced here. It's probably easier to implement on 
low-latency links, but shifting more work towards the in_handler doesn't seem 
to be something that could be easily offloaded to hardware. The code now 
relies even more on the ability of the CPU to tightly control operation.

Anyway, I didn't have time to work on the direction I envisioned, so it's fine 
with me the way it is now.

Best regards,

Dominic
