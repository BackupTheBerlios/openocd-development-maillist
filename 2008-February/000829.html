</I>&gt;<i> Can you be a little more specific? I don't really understand what you

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - JTAG interface hardware, such as an FTDI or Parallel port wiggler
</I>&gt;<i>  - A JTAG core driver, such as ARM9, XScale, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>  - A flash programming interface such as NAND.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sorta guessing here you mean JTAG interface hardware.
</I>
You got it.

The testing problem is similar for target hardware though.

&gt;<i> &gt; Here are some points to consider:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - no device programmers should be favoured  over the other by OpenOCD
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - the number of device programmers is likely to grow as OpenOCD incrases in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; popularity
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - who's responsible for regression testing once a device programmer is supported
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by OpenOCD?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ideally this would the original authour, but in some cases they vanish, or
</I>&gt;<i> the company changes hands, and the information is lost. At least if there
</I>&gt;<i> is source out there which has worked, it can make the job of fixing the
</I>&gt;<i> thing easier.
</I>
At this point I'm arguing that *nobody* should be responsible. We just
log latest version in SVN that passed the tests. Either someone (doesn't matter
who) tests it or they don't. If it failed a test and we haven't seen
fixes in a while,
then delete it from svn trunk.

NB! You can't actually delete or remove anything from svn. It's still there
in the old version!

There is no problem with porting that old stuff up to svn trunk if you want to.

&gt;<i> &gt; - it gets harder to move forward as more device programmers are in OpenOCD
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; svn
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A policy of fix it, or face it being removed is probably the best policy
</I>&gt;<i> here. If it simple does not compile anymore, then there should be an request
</I>&gt;<i> to fix it (to list and original authour(s)) with a given period to say
</I>&gt;<i> 'fix this, or we will remove the code'.
</I>
I don't like this coummunication with &quot;original author&quot; w/deadlines, etc.
I don't think it will work.

We keep a file w/latest tested version and if that version is old and
the code is causing problems, we delete it. No communication
necessary to the authors. This is GPL open source, doesn't
matter who fixes or tests it. Anyone can follow OpenOCD dev list(or
perhaps a low volume list).

If someone ports and tests something that was deleted from trunk
back up to main trunk, fine, it can be committed to trunk again.
