<PRE>Hi &#216;yvind,

Does &quot;wait_halt&quot; wait until the whole reset script has been executed, or just until the target has been halted and in a reset state?

I'm guessing that the reset script will not be completely finished before the next command(s), even if a &quot;wait_halt&quot; is injected in between.

Best regards,
Pieter

I agree. My thinking is that reset should always be synchronous. Why
would anyone want
it to be asynchronous?

There needs to be a timeout w/error message of course if it is asynchronous.

&gt;<i> Can the behaviour be changed to synchronous, or can there be a command
</I>&gt;<i> to wait until a script has finished?
</I>
There is such a command already: wait_halt.
