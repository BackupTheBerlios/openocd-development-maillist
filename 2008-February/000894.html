<PRE>First of all. sorry for being on the development list. I was unable to find a 
users list. Please do redirect me if this place is inappropriate.

I use KDevelop as my IDE for development along with the arm-eabi-none 
toolchain from Codesourcery. This setup / combination works very well for me 
when loading into and executing from RAM. However, it become slightly more 
complex with operating from flash. I first need to create a bin file and then 
need to launch openocd with a alternate config file along with a script to 
first flash the device and then launch gdb with an alternate init script.

Recently i was informed by folks at Codesourcery that GDB is capable of 
writing to flash on the load instruction. I would like to know if i can 
follow this method with openocd as it would save a lot of development time. I 
would request anyone with any knowledge on this to guide me as i was unable 
to find any openocd examples that followed this method.

Any help will be much appreciated!
