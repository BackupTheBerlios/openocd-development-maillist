</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A summary of the situation and a suggestion for various remedies.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've made some modifications to GDB in my latest patch without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; perhaps explaining enough about *why* I ended up making
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; these changes. I understand the negative consequences that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have been raised in the mailing list and I sympathize, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; taking the full picture into account, I landed on making some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; changes to GDB server.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. GDB has a bug where it will fail in various ways if the GDB
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; remote server responds with an error condition for reading
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; memory. This is a known problem in GDB. The quixotic attitude is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that OpenOCD should report an error and the problem
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should be fixed in GDB. My view on this is that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; average user stands no hope in hell of understanding
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the lockups that result in e.g. mouseover evaluation of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; local variables that point to outer space when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; debugging -O3 compiled applications, or e.g. the failure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to evaluate stack traces. The problem has been duely
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reported and recognized by the GDB guys. Once
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GDB is fixed in CVS HEAD, OpenOCD should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have it's kludge removed. Feel free to follow up on this one,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with the GDB guys. I failed to come up with a pactch,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it's quite involved and I wouldn't hold my breath waiting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for this to be fixed &quot;properly&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://sourceware.org/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl?cmd=view%20audit-trail&amp;database=g">http://sourceware.org/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl?cmd=view%20audit-trail&amp;database=g</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;db&amp;pr=2395
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I said in my other post (regarding the bkpts), this change is fine with me,
</I>&gt;<i> even if it breaks existing non-GDB users of the GDB server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But would it be a lot of trouble to make this configurable, with a default of
</I>&gt;<i> return 0x0 and no error? The majority of our users certainly uses GDB, but I
</I>&gt;<i> would like to preserve the existing behaviour if possible, especially as
</I>&gt;<i> there's going to be a long period where people use both compliant and
</I>&gt;<i> non-compliant versions of GDB (after this got fixed in GDB).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know you're against additional configuration options, but I guess this is a
</I>&gt;<i> legitimate reason for adding another one.
</I>
I don't see a compelling specific reason to add such an option at this point.

What's the harm in adding this option only after we discover a
clear an present need for it?


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. GDB has a default 2 second timeout for packets. When reading
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; large amounts of memory from the target GDB will split these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reads into smaller memory reads to avoid running into a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; timeout. The default is 8191 bytes(which is *strange*). Before
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I modified OpenOCD, this would result in 8191 *byte* reads
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from the target(and a timeout), instead of a 8198 32 bit bulk read +
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some byte reads. It is *crucial* to understand
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that users of Eclipse+GDB+OpenOCD have *very* little
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; control(or even understanding) over what sort of queries
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that go to the target. A mouseover can evaluate e.g. a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; global array which can easily be &gt;8191 bytes. It is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; therefore important to service 8191 byte request faster
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; than 2 seconds(achieved via bulk reads), or the user is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in for some nasty debugging of OpenOCD, following
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; subtle hints from Eclipse and digging up obscure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GDB options. Oh and this fix makes Eclipse+GDB
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *much* snappier.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I usually had the remote timeouts increased to be able to attach a gdb to
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD itself so I rarely noticed this. I certainly didn't ever &quot;use&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Eclipse ;). I just don't agree about the exact change, see below.
</I>
I'm not worried about Dominic figuring out how to get OpenOCD
to work :-) I made this change after gathering some data on
on how mere mortals were failing to get Eclipse + OpenOCD
to play together. It's perfectly straighftward to fix the OpenOCD
GDB server to work well within the limits of the default
sensible 2 second timeout.


&gt;<i> &gt; 3. The GDB remote protocol does not guarantee what access type
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is to be used. This can be achieved using &quot;monitor mwX&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; commands. To be guaranteed a certain access type &quot;monitor mwX&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *must* be used. Currently target_read/write_buffer()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will not use 16 and 32 bit access for aligned single word accesses
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and there is no particular reason not to do so. I therefore
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suggest that GDB server should use target_read/write_buffer()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and that target_read/write_buffer() should be changed to guarantee
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use of 16 and 32 bit accesses for single word accesses. NB!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for &gt;1 word access, target_read/write_buffer() should use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the fastest possible read/write, ditto for unaligned accesses,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this to maximize throughput.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> target_read_buffer only guarantees to deliver bytes in the same order as
</I>&gt;<i> they're found on the target, and it does so as fast as possible (if it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't it needs fixing).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The target-&gt;read_memory functions guarantee an access of a certain size.
</I>&gt;<i> Currently that's limited to aligned accesses, but newer ARM architectures
</I>&gt;<i> define unaligned accesses, too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see where we gain anything by moving some implied behaviour from the
</I>&gt;<i> GDB server to the target_read_buffer function? IMHO it belongs to the GDB
</I>&gt;<i> server, because we assume this is what GDB wants.
</I>
At this point my only requirement that is based on observable problems
is that the OpenOCD GDB server needs to service memory read/write
packets as quickly as possible, otherwise OpenOCD will
be broken out of the box. A timeout being indistinguishable from
incorrect operation from the users point of view.

W.r.t. alignment of accesses, you're arguing above that only the
target can know the alignment rules. That would imply that
the target should figure out what type of accesses to service
a GDB request with.
