<PRE>My humble opinion is ...

- Core OpenOCD should not automatically &quot;fix&quot; things that the user with 
knowledge can or should handle

- The core OpenOCD should make it possible to write &quot;clever&quot; extensions 
that &quot;helps&quot; the unwary user.

- gdbserver is only written to make OpenOCD play well with gdb, so if 
gdbserver implements some strictly speaking &quot;incorrect&quot; behaviour that 
makes gdb work with OpenOCD then that is OK with me. As I see it 
gdbserver is not &quot;core&quot; openocd, it is a glue layer, and as such it may, 
or should,  by default do some tricks to make things work smoothly. Of 
course then it should be possible to revert to seeing the pure and 
unchanged truth with a config option.

- A lot of the problems that has been discussed the last weeks depends 
on the inferior quality of supporting scripts, for gdb and openocd and 
different targets, often out of date.  If someone deliver OpenOCD with 
GDB and Eclipse than it must be a complete package where all components 
including the documentation are of the same high quality.

( I usually run openocd with the telnet interface, seldom with gdb+ddd, 
almost never with eclipse )

Regards,
Magnus
