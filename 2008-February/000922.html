Ah, of course.

I've tried those from gdb:

$ src/openocd

Should an empty flash show up as 0 bits or 1 bits? Flash bank 0 is 
located at address 0x00000000, right? In any case, p *0x00000000 already 
returned -1 before; maybe that means, the flash is empty.

(gdb) set *0x00000000=123

Warning: 735 1203348880 arm7_9_common.c:1922 arm7_9_read_memory(): 
memory read caused data abort (address: 0x03803934, size: 0x4, count: 0x1)

Cannot access memory at address 0x3803934

But I'm not sure whether directly writing to flash like this would work 
at all. It's not an eeprom after all.


Now I've got two things that could be a problem:

- I did just compile like this:

$ arm-elf-gcc -g -Wall exp1.c
$ file a.out
a.out: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, version 1 (ARM), statically 
linked, not stripped

and tried to &quot;load&quot; that from gdb (which succeeds but then at the 
adresses it prints during flashing is 'nothing' (iirc all-1-bits, or 
access errors); &quot;cont&quot; from gdb seems to go into an endless jump to 
address 0, e.g. reset loop).

Now I'm also trying:

$ arm-elf-objcopy -O binary a.out a.bin
$ file a.bin
a.bin: data
$ arm-elf-gdb
(gdb) load &quot;a.bin&quot;
&quot;a.bin&quot; is not an object file: File format not recognized

Not sure what to do.

In any case, I'd like to try to load the program into RAM; dunno how to 
do that yet. I welcome any tips.


The other thing I'm wondering about is the reset lines: the wiggler2 (I 
hope so) clone that I've built does feed the parallel port pin 6 (data4) 
through the voltage converter directly to JTRSTn of the ARM, and only 
the parallel port pin 2 (data0) is going through a transistor (open 
collector, pulled up with 50k) to nSRST; so the latter is being 
inverted, while the former is not. Now I've seen in the diploma thesis 
from Dominic, in Figure 1.1, that he is actually inverting *both* nTRST 
and nSRST. Should I do like him or did that change?

&gt;<i> No a divider, 0 being the fastest. Try for speed of 5 or 10 for testing.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
I've put 10 into the .cfg for now.

Thanks,
Christian.
