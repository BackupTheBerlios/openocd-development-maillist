<PRE>A summary of the situation and a suggestion for various remedies.

I've made some modifications to GDB in my latest patch without
perhaps explaining enough about *why* I ended up making
these changes. I understand the negative consequences that
have been raised in the mailing list and I sympathize, but
taking the full picture into account, I landed on making some
changes to GDB server.

1. GDB has a bug where it will fail in various ways if the GDB
remote server responds with an error condition for reading
memory. This is a known problem in GDB. The quixotic attitude is
that OpenOCD should report an error and the problem
should be fixed in GDB. My view on this is that the
average user stands no hope in hell of understanding
the lockups that result in e.g. mouseover evaluation of
local variables that point to outer space when
debugging -O3 compiled applications, or e.g. the failure
to evaluate stack traces. The problem has been duely
reported and recognized by the GDB guys. Once
GDB is fixed in CVS HEAD, OpenOCD should
have it's kludge removed. Feel free to follow up on this one,
with the GDB guys. I failed to come up with a pactch,
it's quite involved and I wouldn't hold my breath waiting
for this to be fixed &quot;properly&quot;.

2. GDB has a default 2 second timeout for packets. When reading
large amounts of memory from the target GDB will split these
reads into smaller memory reads to avoid running into a
timeout. The default is 8191 bytes(which is *strange*). Before
I modified OpenOCD, this would result in 8191 *byte* reads
from the target(and a timeout), instead of a 8198 32 bit bulk read +
some byte reads. It is *crucial* to understand
that users of Eclipse+GDB+OpenOCD have *very* little
control(or even understanding) over what sort of queries
that go to the target. A mouseover can evaluate e.g. a
global array which can easily be &gt;8191 bytes. It is
therefore important to service 8191 byte request faster
than 2 seconds(achieved via bulk reads), or the user is
in for some nasty debugging of OpenOCD, following
subtle hints from Eclipse and digging up obscure
GDB options. Oh and this fix makes Eclipse+GDB
*much* snappier.

3. The GDB remote protocol does not guarantee what access type
is to be used. This can be achieved using &quot;monitor mwX&quot;
commands. To be guaranteed a certain access type &quot;monitor mwX&quot;
*must* be used. Currently target_read/write_buffer()
will not use 16 and 32 bit access for aligned single word accesses
and there is no particular reason not to do so. I therefore
suggest that GDB server should use target_read/write_buffer()
and that target_read/write_buffer() should be changed to guarantee
use of 16 and 32 bit accesses for single word accesses. NB!
for &gt;1 word access, target_read/write_buffer() should use
the fastest possible read/write, ditto for unaligned accesses,
this to maximize throughput.
