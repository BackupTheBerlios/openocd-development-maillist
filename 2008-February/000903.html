</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I've made some modifications to GDB in my latest patch without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; perhaps explaining enough about *why* I ended up making
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; these changes. I understand the negative consequences that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; have been raised in the mailing list and I sympathize, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; taking the full picture into account, I landed on making some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; changes to GDB server.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 1. GDB has a bug where it will fail in various ways if the GDB
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; remote server responds with an error condition for reading
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; memory. This is a known problem in GDB. The quixotic attitude is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that OpenOCD should report an error and the problem
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; should be fixed in GDB. My view on this is that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; average user stands no hope in hell of understanding
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the lockups that result in e.g. mouseover evaluation of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; local variables that point to outer space when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; debugging -O3 compiled applications, or e.g. the failure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to evaluate stack traces. The problem has been duely
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; reported and recognized by the GDB guys. Once
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; GDB is fixed in CVS HEAD, OpenOCD should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; have it's kludge removed. Feel free to follow up on this one,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; with the GDB guys. I failed to come up with a pactch,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; it's quite involved and I wouldn't hold my breath waiting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; for this to be fixed &quot;properly&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://sourceware.org/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl?cmd=view%20audit-trail&amp;databa">http://sourceware.org/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl?cmd=view%20audit-trail&amp;databa</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;se=g db&amp;pr=2395
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As I said in my other post (regarding the bkpts), this change is fine
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with me, even if it breaks existing non-GDB users of the GDB server.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But would it be a lot of trouble to make this configurable, with a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; default of return 0x0 and no error? The majority of our users certainly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; uses GDB, but I would like to preserve the existing behaviour if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible, especially as there's going to be a long period where people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use both compliant and non-compliant versions of GDB (after this got
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fixed in GDB).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I know you're against additional configuration options, but I guess this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is a legitimate reason for adding another one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see a compelling specific reason to add such an option at this
</I>&gt;<i> point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What's the harm in adding this option only after we discover a
</I>&gt;<i> clear an present need for it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 2. GDB has a default 2 second timeout for packets. When reading
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; large amounts of memory from the target GDB will split these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; reads into smaller memory reads to avoid running into a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; timeout. The default is 8191 bytes(which is *strange*). Before
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I modified OpenOCD, this would result in 8191 *byte* reads
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; from the target(and a timeout), instead of a 8198 32 bit bulk read +
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; some byte reads. It is *crucial* to understand
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that users of Eclipse+GDB+OpenOCD have *very* little
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; control(or even understanding) over what sort of queries
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that go to the target. A mouseover can evaluate e.g. a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; global array which can easily be &gt;8191 bytes. It is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; therefore important to service 8191 byte request faster
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; than 2 seconds(achieved via bulk reads), or the user is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; in for some nasty debugging of OpenOCD, following
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; subtle hints from Eclipse and digging up obscure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; GDB options. Oh and this fix makes Eclipse+GDB
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; *much* snappier.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I usually had the remote timeouts increased to be able to attach a gdb to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OpenOCD itself so I rarely noticed this. I certainly didn't ever &quot;use&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Eclipse ;). I just don't agree about the exact change, see below.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not worried about Dominic figuring out how to get OpenOCD
</I>&gt;<i> to work :-) I made this change after gathering some data on
</I>&gt;<i> on how mere mortals were failing to get Eclipse + OpenOCD
</I>&gt;<i> to play together. It's perfectly straighftward to fix the OpenOCD
</I>&gt;<i> GDB server to work well within the limits of the default
</I>&gt;<i> sensible 2 second timeout.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 3. The GDB remote protocol does not guarantee what access type
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; is to be used. This can be achieved using &quot;monitor mwX&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; commands. To be guaranteed a certain access type &quot;monitor mwX&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; *must* be used. Currently target_read/write_buffer()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; will not use 16 and 32 bit access for aligned single word accesses
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and there is no particular reason not to do so. I therefore
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; suggest that GDB server should use target_read/write_buffer()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and that target_read/write_buffer() should be changed to guarantee
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; use of 16 and 32 bit accesses for single word accesses. NB!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; for &gt;1 word access, target_read/write_buffer() should use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the fastest possible read/write, ditto for unaligned accesses,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; this to maximize throughput.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; target_read_buffer only guarantees to deliver bytes in the same order as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they're found on the target, and it does so as fast as possible (if it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't it needs fixing).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The target-&gt;read_memory functions guarantee an access of a certain size.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Currently that's limited to aligned accesses, but newer ARM architectures
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; define unaligned accesses, too.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't see where we gain anything by moving some implied behaviour from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the GDB server to the target_read_buffer function? IMHO it belongs to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GDB server, because we assume this is what GDB wants.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At this point my only requirement that is based on observable problems
</I>&gt;<i> is that the OpenOCD GDB server needs to service memory read/write
</I>&gt;<i> packets as quickly as possible, otherwise OpenOCD will
</I>&gt;<i> be broken out of the box. A timeout being indistinguishable from
</I>&gt;<i> incorrect operation from the users point of view.
</I>
All right, so lets use target_read_buffer for everything except 1, 2 and 4 
byte accesses.

&gt;<i> W.r.t. alignment of accesses, you're arguing above that only the
</I>&gt;<i> target can know the alignment rules. That would imply that
</I>&gt;<i> the target should figure out what type of accesses to service
</I>&gt;<i> a GDB request with.
</I>
Right - this is problematic, because either the target_t-&gt;read/write_memory 
interface needs to be enhanced to translate unsupported accesses to something 
it can support, or GDB needs to evaluate the ERROR_TARGET_UNALIGNED_ACCESS 
return value, and fall back to the target_read_buffer function if necessary.
Currently I'd prefer the latter.

Regards,

Dominic
