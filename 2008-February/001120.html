</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  could you explain a bit more what the patch does, and what your ultimate goal
</I>&gt;<i>  is? &quot;Implementing larger parts of the jtag_xxx() layer in hw+sw&quot; is a bit
</I>&gt;<i>  vague.
</I>
The ultimate goal is to be able to execute the commands immediately
with no memory allocation or structure copy involved. Just plonk
them directly into the hw fifo queue.

Ultimately I'd like to do away with the u8 * buffers for the common(call
frequency) case.

The jtag_xxx() layer effectively adds a *lot* of overhead in percentage
terms. A statemove boils down to a single poke with any niffy
hw implementation. DR shift out of 32 bits boils down to 2 pokes.

As long as the hw fifo is kept full, then the remaining overhead doesn't
matter, but at 32MHz JTAG clk and a sub-100MHz CPU, keeping
the hw fifo full is a full-time job for the CPU :-)

I'm also thinking that some code can call the minidriver fn's directly
in certain cases, such as from inner loop of dcc memory bulk
writes for ARM7/9. This is what we do in our code, but it is hairy
and I wouldn't recommend it for the faint of heart, which is why
I'm gauging the interest in sorting this out in OpenOCD trunk
in a cleaner way.


&gt;<i>  It seems your goal is an alternative set of jtag_xxx functions that doesn't
</I>&gt;<i>  use the jtag_command_queue, but I'm not completely sure about that.
</I>
Why do you care how the lower levels are implemented?

Why not just let hw + sw innovate?

There is nothing wrong with the sw fifo for GHz hosted OpenOCDs.



&gt;<i> Is it  really problematic to start executing JTAG commands when jtag_execute_queue()
</I>&gt;<i>  is called?
</I>
Yes. It completely destroys performance on small embedded CPUs.

It's a non-starter for our purposes.

Why would you want to hold off execution?

&gt;<i> I always thought that the time spent enqueing the commands is
</I>&gt;<i>  rather small compared to the execution time (num TCKs required *
</I>&gt;<i>  1/jtag_clock).
</I>
Our CPU is running on 64MHz and the JTAG clock as fast as 32MHz +
there are wait states on the RAM for the CPU.

OpenOCD running on GHz CPUs with memory bandwidth coming
out of their ears and wicked megabyte large caches
don't run into these problems obviously. :-)
