Hello &#216;yvind,

&#216;yvind Harboe napsal(a):
&gt;&gt;<i>  Particularly, the check for the halted state of the target is basically two lines of code
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  if (bank-&gt;target-&gt;state != TARGET_HALTED)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         return ERROR_TARGET_NOT_HALTED;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are more checks than that to be performed, e.g. illegal sector ranges.
</I>
please see below.

&gt;<i> I thought you argued to do away with the wrapper and have
</I>&gt;<i> the driver invoke a check fn()?
</I>
No, no, misunderstanding, the wrapper is fine with me, it's just the (in my opinion)
unnecessary (and undesired) more virtualization is what I disagreed with.

&gt;<i> That check fn() can report the precise error, e.g. &quot;Error: illegal sector 5&quot;.
</I>
Let the wrapper stay there, but sharpen it to solve two tasks:

1) pre-driver phase: ensure that the driver function is always called with sane parameters,
that is, it shall handle out of range sectors BEFORE calling the driver.

2) post-driver phase: check the error code returned by driver and print out an error message
(as it presently does) - possibly with some explanation what the return code means
but just in case of generic errors (better than just printing out a number).
Otherwise we end up where it was: the same (or similar) ERROR printouts spread across many drivers.
So tet the wrapper handle the common cases (that is what it was put there for, wasn't it?)
and leave the specialties for the driver.

&gt;&gt;<i>  However the driver shall never issue an error message in case of such generic error,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  this is a task for the wrapper.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here I disagree. Information about *what* went wrong should not be
</I>&gt;<i> put into the return value and then translated into an error code, rather
</I>&gt;<i> an ERROR() should be reported at the failure site. This is the
</I>&gt;<i> same that exceptions do and I don't think it makes sense to
</I>&gt;<i> try to do things differently here. :-)
</I>
See above, this is to reduce repeating code and confusion caused by slight differences in error messages
across the code, which in fact mean the same. The driver will, of course, handle all it's special cases
and say what happened. Wrapper is just for generic, well known errors, &quot;target not halted&quot; being a perfect example.
BTW the drivers, as they are, do NOT print an error message, if the target is not halted,
it's the wrapper who does, so the proposal is to make just minimal changes.

Concerning the check function: I found out that there is very little in common among the drivers so we cannot
do a unified check function or two or three - basically, it may different for each driver.
If the driver internally uses a check function, it is its private thing.

Concerning the previous discussion about whether the requirement to have the target halted is
common to the drivers, please do see recent Dominic's post - some flash drivers do not have
associated target AT ALL, so to do such check in flash.c layer by any means is very wrong.
Also the wrapper flash_driver_protect is broken: it does check against sector range,
not protection areas (lock bits), which is currently private to the driver and might not be the same,
see at91sam7 driver as an example.
A change in the drivers might be desired here (?) but this is definitely for the next round.

This means that more complex virtualization on the flash.c layer is out of the discussion anyway,
there is nearly nothing common in preconditions various drivers need, except of the obvious ones,
which are really common by definition, i.e. sector ranges (handled by wrapper), so leaving drivers to
&quot;do it how they like&quot; is IMHO the best solution - if they need more virtualization they can have it,
but as a private thing (like nand flashes - currently not attached to generic flash API).

Best regards,
   Pavel
