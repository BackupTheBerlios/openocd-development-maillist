</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;&gt;  Would not it be better if flash driver functions include a single line something like
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;&gt;  if (flash_check_halted(...)!=ERROR_OK) return ...;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;&gt;  when desired? No extra polymorphism needed, just make the &quot;halted check&quot; centralized.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; Why are you trying to get rid of the polymorphism?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Because I believe that it is generally not a good idea to use polymorphism more than really
</I>&gt;<i>  needed - just because of a single check for target halted. This makes flash driver API
</I>&gt;<i>  more complex than necessary, combined with weak documentation and quick development,
</I>&gt;<i>  this is a way to hell.
</I>
I don't see it that way. Adding this layer of polymorphism addresses the issues
raised and it doesn't add any overwhelming complexity. In fact it makes the
interface and code straightforward while allowing for the driver to do things
it's way.

OpenOCD doesn't use C/C++ w/virtual methods, purely abstract
classes(interfaces),
exceptions, etc. So things that *need* the same concepts,
do look a bit odd when expressed in OpenOCD C speak.

&gt;<i>  Moreover the things which belong together shall stay together, that is, if the operation
</I>&gt;<i>  desires certain conditions which might not be always satisfied it shall check about that itself
</I>&gt;<i>  so that it is clear what it does. Call to subroutine is more clear here rather that hiding this in the upper layer.
</I>
You're trying to avoid polymorphism as if it was a bad thing. This
adds complexity
for no tangible benefit that I've seen.

&gt;<i>  Yes, but at cost of unnecessarily more complex API, just for 5 lines of common code.
</I>&gt;<i>  Counterargument - what benefits brings it over the lightweight approach of calling subroutine in this particular case?
</I>&gt;<i>  Will it be good for anything different than &quot;target halted&quot; check?
</I>
Yes. Today all the drivers are implemented correctly w/the flash_driver_xxx()
frontend.

There is *one* driver so far(not yet committed ;-), that needs a different
solution than the others. I suggest adding flash_driver_xxx() to the
polymorphism to allow the odd drivers to do things differently if they need to.

None of the existing drivers are affected, nor is code outside flash.c

&gt;<i>  The discussion is about whether we do (call graph):
</I>&gt;<i>  1) driver_write =&gt; write =&gt; write_bottom (actual write done in &quot;write_bottom&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>  2) driver_write =&gt; write =&gt; check_halted_or_whatever_first (actual write done in &quot;write&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  In fact, only a single function will be useful as public - that is &quot;write&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  It is all hidden in the driver private layer anyway, so why shall we dictate the driver to use
</I>&gt;<i>  one more function pointer to do it's stuff?
</I>
In any normal polymorphism implementation, this would be handled by defining an
interface and then one or more base classes that implement that
interface which drivers
can subclass to implement the flash driver interface.

However, OpenOCD isn't C/C++ and of the top of my head,  I don't have any
better alternative to emulating interface+base class than what's
described above.

&gt;<i>  Sorry I am still not convinced - I don't like the idea at all.
</I>&gt;<i>  This is not object oriented programming, we are using C, which is about structured programming.
</I>&gt;<i>  Trying to use OOP implementation techniques (build program skeleton by object hierarchy
</I>&gt;<i>  instead of soubroutines) is not good, despite it could technically be done.
</I>
My thinking is that OpenOCD is in agony over not having object
oriented programming w/interfaces, exceptions, etc. in a number of
places besides flash drivers. For now we have to make do without
and OpenOCD *already* has lots of code that more or less successfully
emulates oo concepts.

Perhaps OpenOCD *should* switch to *sensible* use of C/C++,
or perhaps staying in C is better w.r.t. the embedded audience.
