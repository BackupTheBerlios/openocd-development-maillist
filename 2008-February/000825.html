Sounds like a good idea. We could keep a plain text file with names of 
programmers and the last date someone successfully tested it. It should be in 
the interest of vendors to keep their interfaces tested, but a lack of 
attention from a vendor shouldn't cause users to loose support for their 
devices, as long as it's not much work to keep the driver in sync with the 
JTAG layer.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - it gets harder to move forward as more device programmers are in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; OpenOCD svn
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There've been only few changes to the core JTAG layer, mainly your recent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; patches, in quite some time. I don't think there will be (and should be)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; too
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; many changes to this part once we've settled on an API that suits every
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; currently implemented programmer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've still got some in store. We've implemented the entire jtag_xxx()
</I>&gt;<i> layer as I mentioned and this requires that the jtag_xxx() functions
</I>&gt;<i> be defined a bit more precisely. E.g. we've implemented a hw fifo
</I>&gt;<i> rather than a sw fifo. Makes all the difference for OpenOCD running
</I>&gt;<i> on ARM7.
</I>
Yeah, but even if there are more patches to come from your side, this isn't a 
thing that's going on for all time, i.e. at some point we'll have an 
interface that allows for such implementations, and this is going to be the 
most complex interface in use with the OpenOCD for quite some time.

&gt;<i> &gt; - if a device programmer implements a hw layer in an FPGA, then that FPGA
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; bit file won't ship with the source(it makes little sense), so at that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; point the driver is pretty uninteresting to anyone else as well.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One could argue that even the interface between the FPGA and OpenOCD's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; JTAG
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; layer is interesting for anyone who's working on something similar - I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for one would love to know how you're going to implement this ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently it's a bit messy and I prefer to submit patches to sharpen
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD jtag_xxx() layer than to present the current stuff which
</I>&gt;<i> is a bit messy.
</I>
Heh, yeah, I didn't mean to imply that you should release this stuff now.

&gt;<i> &gt; See above - in the spirit of free software I don't see why we shouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; try to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; include support for each and every programmer that can be used together
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the OpenOCD.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To me this is a testing problem and not a free software problem. GPL
</I>&gt;<i> handles the rest :-)
</I>
Right. The rules you mention in the next paragraph should take care of this.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - If nobody tests a device programmer regularly, it should be removed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; from OpenOCD.  This is essentially the same policy that GCC has. They
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; retire
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; target support when nobody tests it anymore.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Definitely a good idea. Guess we can be pretty liberal about this as long
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; driver in &quot;hibernation&quot; doesn't break compilation, but ultimately it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be removed if noone tests and fixes it. I'm thinking about months here?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We could just commit a list of what targets &amp; devices that have been
</I>&gt;<i> tested(last tested OpenOCD revision). As long as it doesn't break
</I>&gt;<i> compilation
</I>&gt;<i> and isn't bothersome, leave it in there. Obviously a target or device that
</I>&gt;<i> hasn't been tested in two years probably isn't going to work, but then
</I>&gt;<i> it's possible to revert to last tested version for said combination. If a
</I>&gt;<i> device/target is retired, but is awoken from hiberanation by development &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> fresh testing, merge it back into main trunk.
</I>
Sounds like a good idea.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; - OpenOCD should be linked with the device programmer software, i.e. no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; binary API exists to OpenOCD library(this could be done long term, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; it's a lot of work).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Not completely sure what you mean here?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's possible to define a binary API such that it would be unecessary to
</I>&gt;<i> link OpenOCD w/device programmer app, this would allow a) release of
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD without re-releasing drivers b) non-GPL programs
</I>&gt;<i> to use OpenOCD as a library. I don't think either is very important
</I>&gt;<i> as a device + openocd combination needs to be retested anyway and
</I>&gt;<i> at that point one might as well ship a single binary (+ sources obviously).
</I>
Agreed.

Dominic
