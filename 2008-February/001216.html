Everywhere in the output during processing config files.
This is caused by the fact command_print adds newline, later on
configuration_output_handler is called, which invokes INFO also adding a newline.
How do we solve this? INFO_SAMELINE?
BTW I would be for calling these macros INFO_N (resembles echo -n),
INFO_SAMELINE is too long.

Well actually... if va_list and va_end are done in every cycle iteration,
then it shall be fine. But the way it is done now it probably does never work
if there is more than one log listener.

I have a proposal how to fix this:
I believe there is no really serious reason why the log callback function should be given
variable argument list. The only one I can think of is allocation of the buffer of a precise size.
which we might also do directly in log_printfv and just pass the ready to use string
to the callback function. The callback handler cannot fiddle with variable parameters
so let's give it the string already formated. (Unless it parses the formatting string itself, but what for?) 

That is, I propose to change prototype of log callback routine to
typedef void (*log_callback_fn)(void *priv, const char *file, int line, const char *function, const char *message);
This way we get rid of the va_list problem in log.c - I vote doing this,
the callback is now used just on two places, so no pain to change it.


&gt;<i> This recent log change has to do with resolving the problem that it is impossible
</I>&gt;<i> to let the caller of the logger/print API decide when the line endings should happen.
</I>
Two possibilities:
Pass log_printfv and information about desired new line addition and it should take care about
this without unnecessary copy of the formatting string - it would simply allocate buffer for the resulting string
one char longer and add \n after formatting the output. log_printfv is not part of the API, makes no harm.

Another solution is do it in the INFO, ERROR (etc) macros using string gluing.

#define OUTPUT(expr, ...) \
	do { \
		log_printfnl (LOG_OUTPUT, __FILE__, __LINE__, __FUNCTION__, expr &quot;\n&quot;, ##__VA_ARGS__); \
	} while(0)

No overhead, no API change, but not sure about portability, (GCC has no problems with that), see
<A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Variadic-Macros.html#Variadic-Macros">http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Variadic-Macros.html#Variadic-Macros</A>


&gt;<i> I don't like the malloc() myself, but a) it only happens if anything

</I>&gt;<i> If I can think of a way to get rid of the malloc() without messing with the
</I>&gt;<i> API, i'll remove it.
</I>
Ok, lets do it the way above, log_printfv is private to log.c, not part of the API.
Similar solution might be used in command print.


&gt;<i> That would cause headaches for the log listeners.
</I>
Sad but true... I have not realized that.
So, shall I take care of the above?
