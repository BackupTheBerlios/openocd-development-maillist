So there is a decrease...

</I>
There are some cases where the amount of available RAM cannot be 
determined - there are some devices of the same family that have the 
same flash size but different amount of RAM. E.g.:
STM32F105VB (CL), 128kB flash, 32kB RAM
STM32F107RB (CL), 128kB flash, 48kB RAM

However, that is enough to determine max amount of RAM with &quot;small&quot; 
error - there are such pairs with (more or less) &quot;adjacent&quot; amounts of 
ram (4/6, 6/10, 32/48, 48/64, etc.). I'd even like to do that, but the 
mechanics of OpenOCD is still a big mystery for me - in 
stm32x_write_block() (stm32x.c) the buffer size to be allocated is fixed 
at 16kB, and this file does nothing with workareasize defined in cfg 
files (I think...).

What is the reason to use fixed buffer size of 16kB? Shouldn't that be 
changed as there are chips with more RAM and those could benefit from 
higher workareasize (I cannot check, I only have chips with 20kB of RAM).

Of course another solution would be to create a &quot;general&quot; cfg file and 
small dedicated cfg files for every STM32 device available (currently 
89) - these would use (include) the &quot;general&quot; cfg. The structure of the 
target folder could be changed to
target
	- st
		- stm32
			stm32f103rb.cfg
			stm32f105v8.cfg
			...
		- str7
			str710.cfg
			str711.cfg
			...
		- str9
			...
	- nxp
		- lpc17xx
			...
		- lpc2xxx
			...
and so on.

I think that would improve the &quot;OpenOCD experience&quot; for the users... 
It's still not very user-friendly );

I could try to do some patches, but I'd first like to hear your opinions.

4\/3!!
