</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> want the help from the community.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Although I love git very much, I do not want to do this. I am working
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on a patch that I can share with some people locally, and I can not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make a patch on a master branch that constantly changes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In such cases, I think you'll be hard pressed to find help in the open
</I>&gt;<i> source community. If you show no intention of contributing back
</I>&gt;<i> to the community, that's a huge disincentive for the community
</I>&gt;<i> to work with you.
</I>I disagree on this, having a lot of experience in OS. Every bug
pointed, discussed and &quot;workarounded&quot; or solved, and any information
that can put some light on the problem are very helpful for all those
who come up with the same problem. Working for the community is not
only contribution of raw code, but more the right info that can be
shared. Here I pointed the problem and gave some solutions. It's a
mini-patch, if you like it - can be helpful for someone.

I have intention to share all innovative and useful stuff, as I always
did, but at this particular case it is something very specific (custom
FPGA design of JTAG interface on custom SoC) and will be totally
uninteresting for OpenOCD community as no person would use it.

&gt;<i> It sounds like you don't have experience with git rebasing, because
</I>&gt;<i> git rebase really makes working on top of the master branch
</I>&gt;<i> simple in most cases, besides it is simply not true that
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD master branch &quot;constantly changes&quot; these days in the
</I>&gt;<i> sense that it would be hard or cumbersome to develop and rebase
</I>&gt;<i> most feature branches on top of it.
</I>OK, I'll see about this. But I am convinced that it will be more
easier for the most of the people to apply patch 6 months from now on
a stable release, than to clone dev branches, rebase, integrate the
changes etc...
