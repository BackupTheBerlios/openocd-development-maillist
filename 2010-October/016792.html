@Laurent:
&gt;<i>For now, if you want to speed up your OpenOCD , build OpenOCD with d2xx driver :-) !
</I>
Tried that on windows ... Makes no difference, either driver gives the same speed, the bottleneck is OpenOCD, on Linux I can't even get openocd to see the adapter with the d2xx driver, I have to use libftdi ...

@&#216;yvind:
&gt;<i>Somebody just has to step up and do the work to profile the Cortex-M3 flash programming case and rewrite the higher level codes and performance should &gt;be dramatically improved.
</I>
I agree totally, it shouldn't be too hard to get &gt;200KB/s with some modifications for this micro, after all sending 256bytes per 1ms USB frame is a no-brainer ... USB can support 1500bytes per 1ms frame in theory, 1200 bytes in practice, and you can easily get around the latency issues. I have done this with USB-&gt;CAN at these sorts of speeds no problem.

@Peter:
&gt;<i>Any real solution just has to give up trying to run this from the PC.
</I>&gt;<i>It's stupid. I think some dongles do more or less of it already.
</I>&gt;<i>FT2232 obviously does not do it at all, whether full or high speed.
</I>&gt;<i>The USB-Blaster CPLD seems to be slightly more clever, but is not quite fully utilized.
</I>&gt;<i>A PC is USELESS for any kind of bitbanging or the like (MPSSE in crap FTDI chips counts just the same!) - there are *at least* THREE bus masters &gt;between CPU and IO pin, and you want it to be fast? Come on..
</I>
Rubbish! The bottleneck is OpenOCD,  A PC is more than capable to do all the work necessary to support &quot;dumb (read simple)&quot; interface chips like the FT2232, I like OpenOCD's concept of putting all the brains in the software and support simple/cheap hardware ... After all who wants another BDI2000, like &#216;yvind says, it just needs a little work.

Not that I have much of a say, but I fully support improving OpenOCD on cheap adapters rather than &quot;relying&quot; on the purchase or building of an intelligent adapter .. I think that is the wrong direction to go ..... My 2c

Cheers,
Bernie
