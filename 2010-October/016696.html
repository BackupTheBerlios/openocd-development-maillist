<PRE>I am not sure if this is an OpenOCD issue or just a linux hardware
issue. I have done my best to figure it out but I am pretty much out
of ideas.

I am using 0.5.0-dev-00553-g6229e43. The ICDI is labeled BD-ICDI-B and
came with the LM3S9B92 development board.

If any of you have the ICDI setup and working I'd be interested in
what rules you have in udev and anything else you have set up to make
the USART available. The JTAG seems to work fine.

There was a time when accessing the USART on the ICDI board was
possible (though this may have been with openocd 0.3.1 binary which
didn't have good reset halt support for this JTAG). However, now the
tty-device appears to be the JTAG polling data and not the USART.

I have two rules.d files.

the relevant line is: ATTRS{idVendor}==&quot;0403&quot;,
ATTRS{idProduct}==&quot;bcda&quot;, MODE=&quot;664&quot;, GROUP=&quot;plugdev&quot; it is just a
stripped down version of what is in the contrib directory.

I also have another file (99-usbftdi.rules) with the rule:

ATTRS{idVendor}==&quot;0403&quot;, ATTRS{idProduct}==&quot;bcda&quot;,
RUN+=&quot;/sbin/modprobe -q ftdi-sio product=0xbcda vendor=0x0403&quot;

On boot there are two devices ttyUSB0 and ttyUSB1. On running openocd
with the luminary board script, ttyUSB0 is disconnected (dmesg).

Attaching to ttyUSB1 while openocd is running prints lots of data that
has nothing to do with what is on the USART line (I presume it is JTAG
data as it is the same until hex repeated until I issue a command).

I looked in the c-code at static int icdi_jtag_init(void), and it
seems like that tells the FT2232 what to do with its pins. But I am
not sure exactly what the mechanism that unregisters (disconnects)
ttyUSB0 is.

Nor do I understand why the JTAG data is seemingly being put on
ttyUSB1. I would have presumed the openocd was hiding the JTAG and
leaving the USART tty device.

I am not sure if there is something else I have to do to have Ubuntu
(10.04) point to the right part of compound USB device, I presume the
c-code must be right in the ft2232.c file.

If any of you have the ICDI setup and working I'd be interested in
what rules you have in udev and anything else you have set up to make
the USART available.

I guess I should say that my code to print to the USART works
(verified with scope), also everything works driver wise in win 7.
Thus this is either openocd or linux driver issue.

Thanks for any suggestions!
