Actually I'd like to put in a word for the original OpenOCD design insight.

What OpenOCD does is to queue up lots of reads and writes. The solution
to handling post-processing of data read in are callbacks. As long as
the C code does not have to take conditional action on the returned result,
this can mean long read/write sequences without a turnaround.

I didn't look too carefully at the #'s that were posted, but I believe that the
there were some &gt;100kBytes/s for ST and an FTDI dongle in there
somewhere, i.e. long latency interface and good throughput.

Somebody just has to step up and do the work to profile the Cortex-M3
flash programming case and rewrite the higher level codes and performance
should be dramatically improved.

There are USB dongles out there that has a CPU sitting on the JTAG adapter,
e.g. Segger but that requires work on the firmware as you point out.

&gt;<i>From a maintenance point of view, I believe it would be *MUCH* more economical
</I>to simply fix the higher level OpenOCD code to be more robust towards longer
latencies. That code can be tested on *all* interfaces. If OpenOCD can get
maintainable code that runs at &gt; 50% maximum theoretical throughput, then
I think we should be very pleased. More performance is better, but at
&gt;<i>50% throughput,
</I>I wouldn't trade much for reduced maintainability.

ZY1000 does it slightly differently: simply put it runs OpenOCD &amp; Linux on
the unit and has direct access to the hardware accelerated FPGA registers,
very, very low latency. That said, I'm sure it would benefit from the higher
level performance bottlenecks being sorted out.
