</I>
Thanks for the hint about DBGMCU_CR. I didn't know that, and it could
prove useful. However, I don't actually want to debug in stop mode. One
thing I failed to mention is that, after a system reset, the firmware
puts the STM32 in run mode until it's sent a command over USB putting it
into the stop/wake cycle. During this time in run mode, debugging
normally works fine.

The problem is that after even one attempt at debugging during stop
mode, the debug unit appears permanently broken and doesn't work in
*run* mode any more. Only power-cycling the STM32 fixes it. Pulling
BOOT0 high during reset and sending the STM32 into its bootstrap loader
doesn't help either.

&gt;<i> One can also ponder why you need debug access to something molded in
</I>&gt;<i> plastic... Wouldn't it be better to debug your application on a more
</I>&gt;<i> lab-friendly setup?
</I>
Good point! This is about firmware upgrades in the field as much as
anything. Ideally I'd have liked to use the serial bootstrap loader for
doing that simply, but we have more than a hundred of these devices with
an error in the hardware which means that the USART connection to the
outside world is broken. No problem, I thought, we'll just use JTAG.

I'd like to work out whether the debug unit really does break, or
whether there's just a misunderstanding about state between it and OpenOCD.
