I like this idea as well. Not so much for my own use, but still. I
think it can be done pretty easily too. LPT is out of fashion, so
just mapping USB ids in cfg files against what libusb happens to find
in the system will even allow autodetecting many/most interfaces.

The first step is probably to make the &quot;connect&quot; operating explicit
rather than implicit in OpenOCD, so that it can be controlled
remotely from the GUI.

Of course, this now ventures into an area where there is significant
overlap between OpenOCD, UrJTAG and Altera's jtagserver and STAPL
player. It would be awesome to unify those things, since they do the
same thing in some ways, but that's a completely different project.
(Important though, IMO.)

</I>
Yes, the only options are to be patient or to be active. Ideally
everyone is a little bit active, but it's always difficult to find
the right balance between what you need yourself and what extra you
can contribute because you know that it would help others.


&gt;<i> The sad reality is that in general the progress is not that fast

</I>
Reality yes, sad I don't know. It is what it is. If the community is
very active then the project makes quick progress. If the community
is not so active then progress take longer.

It's true in general that open source projects could use more
developer resources.
