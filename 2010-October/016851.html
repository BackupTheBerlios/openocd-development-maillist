I was considering this too. I strongly prefer a single file for the
entire family if possible, but it should not cost very much, if any,
performance.

</I>&gt;<i> and so on.

Too many levels IMO. Just put stm32, str7, str9 directly under
target. I don't know the ST parts, but I like NXP a lot and I've
started looking at the TI LM3S (I think we should rename the files
from stellaris) which also look nice. Have a look at stellaris.cfg,
which seems to be generic for that family.


&gt;<i> I think that would improve the &quot;OpenOCD experience&quot; for the users...
</I>
Yes and no. I think that it's really nice to only need to specify the
family of chips that you're working with.


&gt;<i> It's still not very user-friendly );
</I>
Also yes and no. A typical openocd.cfg should just pull in some
existing files from tcl/ but there are a lot of bad examples which
confuse things, by copypasting everything into openocd.cfg instead of
sourcing the distributed cfg files.

If there isn't one already then I think an example on the web would
go a long way. Do we have a wiki?
