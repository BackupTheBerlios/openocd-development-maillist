<PRE>The following is for your information.

The good thing about this latest release is that it has the
new device filter wizard GUI. Using this GUI, you can
install libusb-win32 filter to a specific USB device
(actually a specific interface of a specific USB device).

For example, if you want to use J-Link and OpenOCD,
you can install the libusb-win32 device filter to the
J-Link. In that case, the existing Segger driver is
intact. So you can use IAR and OpenOCD without
switching driver.

Similarly, you can attach the libusb-win32 device
filter to the Interface A of your FT2232x based
JTAG debugger. The existing FTDI driver is intact.
Therefore you can use the FTDI D2XX based application
(like IAR) and OpenOCD (libftdi based, again using
libusb-win32) without switching driver.

The device filter mode is safer than the previous
release (class filter to all possible USB device)
since it will not attach to those device you
do not want to disturb (like you HID keyboard,
mouse and USB mass storage device).


Regards,
Xiaofan

As always, we recommend you to use the latest version.

LibUsb-Win32 Change Log

V1.2.2.0 (10/02/2010)
=======================
* Added install-filter-win.exe. &#160;A gui installer for device filters.

* Added new libusb0.dll function usb_install_np_rundll(). &#160;This function
&#160;is designed for rundll32.exe and takes the same parameters as
&#160;install-filter.exe.

* Updated install-filter.exe. &#160;This application has several new features.
&#160;Type &quot;install-filter --help&quot; for more details.

* Updated libusb-win32-devel-filter package. &#160;This package is once again
&#160;available for download as a setup.exe.

* Updated libusb-win32 &quot;bin&quot; package format. &#160;inf-wizard.exe has been moved
&#160;up one directory.

* Updated driver_installer_template.iss example. This is an Inno Setup
&#160;Script showing how to create your own setup.exe for installing your
&#160;application and driver.

* Fixed missing byte order marker in inf-wizard.exe .inf files. (libwdi)

* Fixed auto-configuration issue when there is more than one driver in the
&#160;stack.

* Fixed BSOD when using the filter driver with devices that are auto
&#160;suspended by other drivers in the stack.

* Fixed BSOD for devices with endpoints that have '0' for wMaxPacketSize.

* Fixed BSOD when cancelling large transfers on high speed devices.


V1.2.1.0 (07/28/2010)
=======================
* Updated bulk.c to include async i/o example code.

* Fixed usb_install_driver_np() issue with inf-wizard generated infs.

* Fixed inf2cat.exe issue with inf-wizard generated infs.

* Added 'Install Now' feature to inf-wizard. (libwdi)

* Added embedded libusb-win32 binaries to inf-wizard. (libwdi)

* Added libwdi (<A HREF="http://www.libusb.org/wiki/libwdi">http://www.libusb.org/wiki/libwdi</A>) to inf-wizard.

* Added get cached configuration request to usb_open(). This is a new
&#160;control code that involves no device i/o and allows
&#160;usb_set_configuration() to be omitted if the driver has already
&#160;configured it.

* Fixed set_configuration() failure for devices that do not properly
&#160;support get_configuration().

V1.2.0.0 (07/07/2010)
=======================
* First signed driver release! The libusb-win32 kernel driver (libusb0.sys)
&#160;can now be used on x64 Windows machines that require signed drivers.

* Fixed 2128187 reported by Tim Green. usb_get_descriptor() can fail
&#160;because the given buffer of 8 bytes is too small.

* Fixed 2928293 reported by Tim Green. Sometimes the call to
&#160;usb_fetch_and_parse_descriptors() in usb_find_devices() can fail. This
&#160;patch moves the LIST_ADD to after a successful read of the device's
&#160;configuration descriptors.

* Fixed issue causing libusb-win32 to not act as power policy owner
&#160;when it should.

* Fixed issue in which on rare occasion, a libusb-win32 filter device could
&#160;run as a &quot;normal&quot; device.

* Fixed filter driver issue for device using wudfr.sys.

* Added large transfer splitting to driver (bulk, int, iso). NOTE:
&#160;The dll continues to break transfers in the same manner it always has.
