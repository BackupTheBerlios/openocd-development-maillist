</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But in this situation single file costs performance,

Unless there is a way to tell devices apart.


&gt;<i> BTW I do not prefer single file for whole family,
</I>
Why not? No big deal, but I'm curious.


&gt;<i> anyway OpenOCD does not have it as a rule.
</I>
No, but I think that it is very important to have only a single
recommended hierarchy for cfg files. Ie. that files in board/ must
always be &quot;higher level&quot; than files in target/. I think this is the
case now, and it is very important for understanding.


&gt;<i> &gt; Too many levels IMO. Just put stm32, str7, str9 directly under
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; target.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Number of level is not important. Can be my way, can be your way (;
</I>
I do think number of levels is important. Fewer levels allows for a
much quicker overview.


&gt;<i>  &gt; Yes and no. I think that it's really nice to only need to specify the
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; family of chips that you're working with.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe yes, but naming the specific chip does no harm either.
</I>
It requires more detailed manual configuration, ie. less automation,
which is really annoying if it can be avoided. But sometimes it can't
be avoided. I guess this is the case here.


&gt;<i>  &gt; Also yes and no. A typical openocd.cfg should just pull in some
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; existing files from tcl/ but there are a lot of bad examples which
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; confuse things, by copypasting everything into openocd.cfg instead of
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; sourcing the distributed cfg files.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I strongly disagree. &quot;User friendly&quot; nowadays means GUI and total
</I>&gt;<i> ease-of-use.
</I>
Many may prefer GUI but please do not make the mistake of thinking
that GUI is the only way to have ease of use!!

GUIs such as Eclipse are sometimes so bad that they become counter-
productive. I've touched on the Eclipse surface a few times in
different contexts and it has always been an absolute disaster.
It's the very definition of bloat if you ask me.

On the other hand, if all circumstances are right and it fits the
user's needs, then I am sure that it is wonderful.

I know others who also quite strongly prefer command line control
over OpenOCD as well as the other development tools.

And I know several who are conditioned into thinking that GUI or IDE
is the only way of working. Eclipse and other GUIs are very important
since it helps them.

Ease of use is another story however; I certainly agree about
out-of-the-box being important, both for GUI and CLI!


&gt;<i> You know NXP chips, so you probably know Flash Loader.
</I>
No, I've only used OpenOCD, mtools (for the USB storage bootloader
in LPC134x since it makes assumptions about sector allocation which
mismatch what the kernel vfat driver does) and vsprog so far. I avoid
Windows as much as I can.

It's really sad that NXP has even gone so far as to put in datasheets
that the USB bootloader will only work with Windows. I guess we will
only see more such nonsense in the future, as vendors try to focus on
core business but must also integrate with a whole world around them
that they do not understand the least bit. Difficult! Sorry, back on
topic now. :)


&gt;<i> It is possible to use this application right &quot;out-of-the-box&quot;, you
</I>&gt;<i> don't need to browse through the cfg files, change anything there,
</I>&gt;<i> read manual with commands, etc. You just run and use it.
</I>
I did a few hours of research before starting with ARM last year,
bought a nice development board with cfg in board/ and a JTAG adapter
with cfg in interface/, and then I spent about 60 minutes on stuff
before I had everything from toolchain to debugger and blinking LED
working. I think that is pretty amazing, and it proves that the tools
are really good already.

No doubt they can get even better, but 60 minutes is already very
close to out-of-the-box. I don't think it's useful to optimize that
process too much more, because someone who can not manage to overcome
such a small hurdle will inevitably fail miserably later in their
project anyway, and should just be doing something else, or the same
thing but in a different way. (Maybe using Flash Loader?)


&gt;<i> Requiring somebody to write cfg files is not the right way to go.
</I>
Yes and no. I agree that it would have sucked if I had to write a
target cfg for the device on my development board. But I didn't,
because I made sure to buy a board that was already supported. Since
OpenOCD is an open source project I don't think that it is realistic
for anyone to expect that *every* possible target will already be
supported. I also don't think you suggested this either, but clearly
we all want more target cfg files. :)

As for Flash Loader, the name suggests that it is a download-only
program, maybe not so much involved in debugging. OpenOCD does both,
and since the latter requires a lot more information it is
unneccessarily complicated to just do a firmware download. This might
actually be a significant possible improvement for OpenOCD. On the
other hand, you typically want the debugger working pretty soon as
well..


&gt;<i> IMHO cfg files for all chips should be created, so that in std
</I>&gt;<i> cases ppl would not need to write any files.
</I>
Yep! Please send patches. I will also.


&gt;<i>  &gt; If there isn't one already then I think an example on the web would
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; go a long way. Do we have a wiki?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is your way, &quot;my way&quot; is to start OpenOCD with additional command
</I>&gt;<i> line parameters (-f interface/sth.cfg -f target/sth.cfg -c &quot;jtag_khz 1000&quot;).
</I>
Yes! I've tried to play with this a few times. I think it looks like
a nice way to use openocd when openocd.cfg would do nothing but
source existing files. I didn't get it to do exactly what I wanted,
but I like this approach too because it doesn't require a config
file. On the other hand the long command line is very annoying to type.


&gt;<i> It's pretty hard (impossible?) to override anything through command
</I>&gt;<i> line parameters...
</I>
Hm? I was not really clear about how -c relates to e.g. procedures
defined in openocd.cfg. Do you know more about the ordering?


&gt;<i> You like your way, I like mine, probably neither of us will change
</I>&gt;<i> their habits. I'm pretty sure there are some other ways and OpenOCD
</I>&gt;<i> should allow to use it easily too.
</I>
I don't know if I really have a habit yet. ;) I haven't been using
OpenOCD for that long..


&gt;<i> Separate CFGs for all chips is the way to go IMHO.
</I>
Only if optimal family cfg files are impossible. I think they are. :\


&gt;<i> BTW such files would not prevent using general &quot;family&quot; files.
</I>
Hm? I agree that a &quot;base&quot; family cfg would still be there, but I
think that it's important to emphasize that users should never source
family cfg files directly then, and should always use or create a
device specific cfg file. Otherwise it will be really difficult to
understand how OpenOCD is meant to work, and what to do when.

Using Tcl cfg files in the first place already creates a bit of
confusion, but I also can't say that I disagree with it or that
I can suggest something better.
