Fair enough. Always the tradeoff between using and producing tools.

As much as I dislike things ftdi it'd be nice to touch up that driver
a little. Going to libftdi-1.0 would be a somewhat major change I
think, but small simple fixes might be to get rid of the segfault
when JTAG adapter is not plugged, and if the adapter is unplugged
while OpenOCD is running then it goes into some loop printing error
messages. Anyway, I'd like to do more testing with the Versaloon.


&gt;<i> Good target/board scripts can do wonder for the &quot;OpenOCD experience...&quot;
</I>
Yes, I would even say that they are key. Have to refresh those Tcl
skills.


&gt;<i> Some scripts are also a lot of work to put together.
</I>
No doubt. Especially if they are to be really generic.
