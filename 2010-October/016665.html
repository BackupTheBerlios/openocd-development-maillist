</I>&gt;<i> &gt;/ But it seems to be very slow. I got a lot of packet errors, when loading a binary... I will check my configuration files tomorrow and try to get a binary loaded and debugged.
</I>&gt;<i> /yep - I discovered the same problem. It seems that it takes in the range of ms (USB Poll interval?) between single commands. I got a TCK speed of about 100-300 Hz with LIBFTDI.
</I>&gt;<i> It becomes significantly faster if more than one byte is sent to libftdi in one call. So there IMHO this calls for aggregation of data before passing it to the interface.

</I>Hi Felix,

They are two major troubles with the Altera USB Blaster :

1. This one could be corrected in the Openocd source :

I remember when Dominic (the creator / author of OpenOCD) ask me about 
speed on december 2004 ... yes, 2004 !
I replied to Dominic to queue a maximum of commands before sending to 
the Amontec JTAGkey ( <A HREF="http://www.amontec.com">http://www.amontec.com</A> ).
This was what we done on begin of 2005 in the OpenOCD ft2232 API driver.
So if you want to accelerate the Altera USB Blaster you have to queue 
the commands in the API driver and then send a sequence of command to 
the device.

2. This one cannot be corrected/modified in the OpenOCD source ( Blaster 
hardware issues):

A debug session of a ARM or ARM Cortex processor need to have control of 
SRST (System Reset) and sometimes TRST (TAP Reset). The Altera USB 
Blaster do not provide these signals by default and this will be a 
potential source of error when connecting to your target.
Also, the RTCK (Return Clock) is not supported by the USB Blaster. The 
RTCK is really important to have on ARM7tdmi-s or the newer Cortex-A9 
(Ax) ... to name a few. The RTCK helps to synchronize the JTAG Emulator 
with the target frequency.
The JTAG frequency of the Blaster is difficult to manage. It is OK for 
programming a FPGA, but troubleshooting when debugging a ARM !
