<PRE>&quot;Peter Stuge&quot; &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">peter at stuge.se</A>&gt; napisa&#322;(a): 
 &gt; You must have missed the patches.

I don't think so. SWD is being talked about for ~2 years, in the meantime SWD-only chips appeared on the market (LPC1xxx, LPC13xx, etc.), commercial and free toolchains support it already, OpenOCD is (IMHO) not even close... Sure, there've been some patches, like 1 every few months, but I guess implementing SWD will require a lot of patches (&gt;100?). In 2009 there was new release every ~4months, since 0.4.0 almost 9 months have passed, and I don't think we'll see 0.5.0 with SWD anytime soon.
 
 &gt; If you
 &gt; can help, go for it.

I'd like to, but I can't - not my level of knowledge, not my level of skill - I'm just an embedded engineer, not PC programmer.

 &gt; Just remember that GUI is not the only way, and
 &gt; that flashing and debugging are distinct (although related!) tasks.

Sure not, but the most successful commercial/free-demo tools are GUI-only (Keil, IAR, CrossWorks, etc.). Whatever you think about Windows, GUIs or ease-of-use, the facts are that these are popular because they can be operated by a monkey (;

4\/3!!
