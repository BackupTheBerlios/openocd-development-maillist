<PRE>Brian,

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi All,
</I>&gt;<i>    Forgive my ignorance on this as I've never contributed to 
</I>&gt;<i> the open source community before. I have attached jlink.c 
</I>&gt;<i> with some fixes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
As it your first patch, welcome to the community :)
For info details about how to submit patches can be found in the dev guide:
<A HREF="http://openocd.berlios.de/doc/doxygen/index.html">http://openocd.berlios.de/doc/doxygen/index.html</A> - have a look into the
patch primer.
simply you would do the following:
svn diff &gt; jlink.patch

&gt;<i>    I'd recently gotten a mini2440 a samsung ARM9 based board. 
</I>&gt;<i>  I really wanted to develop under linux and use openocd,  but 
</I>&gt;<i> it didn't work so I took the problem to root cause.  Anway 
</I>&gt;<i> the 10 pin connectors do not connect RTCK for adaptive 
</I>&gt;<i> clocking (very thoughtful), so when I built a cable adapter 
</I>&gt;<i> for my JLINK it didn't work.. found out in the jlink_init() 
</I>&gt;<i> they said the default to adaptive clocking which will fail 
</I>&gt;<i> with a 10 pin connector. So I changed it to do what it would 
</I>&gt;<i> do normally, and if it failed, then to force the clock to 1/2 
</I>&gt;<i> max of the JLINK adapter (6 Mhz).  Seems to work fine on the 
</I>&gt;<i> two jlink adapters I have tried it and shouldn't run any 
</I>&gt;<i> aditional code if things are working peachy. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
The rclk is not part of the coresight spec from ARM.

The patch could be cleaned up a little.
Perhaps we need to cache the jlink caps in the jlink_get_version_info called
from jlink_init.
If EMU_CMD_GET_SPEEDS is not supported (older jlinks) then a divide by zero
is lurking.

Not really sure this belongs in jlink.c, as it is related to the jtag layer
rather than a specific adapter.

For info i have just also been testing a patch that changes the rclk
fallback mechanism, so your patch may
need some work because of this.

&gt;<i>   I may be writting some more support code for this in a 
</I>&gt;<i> while (more flash support, etc).. so I wanted to stay on the 
</I>&gt;<i> developer list so as I hear back from members as this isn't 
</I>&gt;<i> how you do it, I won't do it this way in the future.  My time 
</I>&gt;<i> is limited, but I will donate what I can and try to learn the 
</I>&gt;<i> protocol for submitting fixes/additions. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
patches always welcome !!

Cheers
Spen

</PRE>
