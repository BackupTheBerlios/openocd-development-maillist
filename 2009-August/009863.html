<PRE>Hi David, 

&gt;<i> To handle syscalls ... use a GDB server (or stub) 
</I>&gt;<i> running native in that OS.  Not on bare metal, not talking over JTAG.
</I>
But that could use up precious resources that you might not have (memory and
I/O). Also, why should you have to switch to software based debugging (Which
might not be as reliable as JTAG h/w debug), just because you want to use
File I/O while debugging?

&gt;<i> The target is &quot;bare metal&quot;, and likely has its own notions 
</I>&gt;<i> of what makes a syscall and how its params get passed.
</I>
Yes, OpenOCD will need to understand this (just as a stub running on the
target would), but many targets often only have 1 or 2 standard ways of
doing this. 

Cheers,
Jon
