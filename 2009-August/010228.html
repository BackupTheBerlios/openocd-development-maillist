You won't like it (; , but ... it's attached. The file is a part of a 
.zip archive with libusb-win32 drivers.

&gt;<i> If the .inf file was changed from the repository version, post it too.
</I>
Actually, the .inf file is not in the repository - I've suggested adding 
it a while ago, but there was no interest. I attach that too.

The only JTAG from the /interface/ folder I did not include was the one 
from axm0432.cfg - Axiom axm0432. I just couldn't find any info about 
that in the internet, so I don't know whether it's a JTAG-only or JTAG + 
UART/RS-232 device. That's probably pretty unique device anyway. There 
is a slight chance that I've guessed that wrong for a few other devices 
(like SheevaPlug and the developement boards with embedded JTAG) - so 
that can be checked. Some names can also be changed, including that 
stupid &quot;(Channel A/B)&quot; &lt;:

I hope that there are no drastic mistakes, as I don't like the idea of 
another &quot;service release&quot; - the executable is not changed and there are 
inconsistent packages flying around the net. If 0.3.0 will be done some 
time soon any minor corrections can be done then.

BTW - if anyone wishes to do any changes, the style can be changed for 
sure - I know that I'm no English poet &lt;:

4\/3!!
