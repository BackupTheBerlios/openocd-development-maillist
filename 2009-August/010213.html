Okay, I was not sure about the state transitions and such, I can remove that 
part and plant some asserts in the other paths to make sure they are not 
called before the core is paused.

I sincerely disagree here. These bits directly come out of the Cortex A8 
Technical Reference Manual and not following them is not making things fast 
but it makes them unreliable.

In other words, why would ever want to read half of the result?

Ah great, from my understanding the code running on the core can access the L3 
and L4 registers as well. So in theory and practice the code running on the 
core has changed the ITR flag. This is why I put it into the debug_entry right 
after saving the old DSCR to make sure it is enabled.


maybe this clear things up, I will need to single step through linux to see 
when stuff breaks in OpenOCD... my assumption is enabling the MMU but I will 
find this out next week.

	z,
