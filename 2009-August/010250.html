<PRE>Hi Peter,

As requested, you will find the file I developed for the AT91SAM9G20-EK
board I currently have in my possession that I use with a SAM-ICE debugger.
I haven't quite finished it yet, but it seems to be working quite well on my
setup at this stage.  Admittedly, I haven't used it yet to debug things that
depend on the MMU such as the Linux kernel.  For straight code, however, it
works like a champ with GDB.

I put substantially more comments in the file then are typically found in
most configuration files.  I did this to make it easier for other people to
follow the logic and also be cognizant of what they may need to change if
they adapt it to their own proprietary hardware developments.  The AT91SAM
processors have many &quot;knobs&quot; that give the processor a great deal of utility
but also provide ample opportunities to mess up things.

When I observe flaky board behavior, one of the first things I start looking
for is timing issues. To uncover hidden problems, I did a top to bottom
review of datasheets for both memory devices and the CPU as I created the
new configuration file.

One of the discoveries I made was that the settings of SDRAM_CR register
found in the current scripts violate timing requirements of the SDRAM on the
AT91SAM9G20 (and likely on the AT91SAM9260 also).  When I noticed the same
values were also found in Atmel sample source code files, I emailed my
concerns a few days ago to Atmel.  After reviewing my email they agreed and
now are in the process of updating their project files.  So if you compare
the old files against mine, you will notice a new setting for this.

The clock is another issue in the scripts.  The MCLK is advertised to be
working at 198 MHz, but that is not possible since the speed grade of the
SDRAM on the evaluation boards is only good with SDCLK equal to or less then
133 MHz.  You will also see that I don't depend on delays and instead
physically monitor the clock status registers before moving forward in the
initialization sequence.

Anyway, although I can't promise you success or that the intermediate file I
provided is perfect, it hopefully will work better for you then what you
currently have.  In any case, let me know if this helps you or you have
other questions.

Gary
