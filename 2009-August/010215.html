<PRE>Hi Ferdinand,

I have managed to work through most of my problems with &#179;reset init&#178; on the
AT91SAM9G20-EK board.  The unstable behavior I suffered through the last
couple of weeks appears to now be confirmed as configuration issues in
certain registers that are set by the vanilla AT91SAM9260 target file that
mostly relate to the clock and SDRAM.  These were causing internal timing
issues.

I have create a new board configuration file for the AT91SAM9G20-EK with a
number of structural changes that now seem to be working nicely.  If these
continue hold during further testing, I plan on releasing the new patch
file.  People who have 9260 targets can then make decision whether they want
to incorporate some of these changes also (the 9G20/9260 are kissing cousins
after all)

The one missing piece for the AT91SAM9260/ATSAM9G20 family is a device
driver for the NAND flash.  I was fixing to write something myself until I
stumbled on a recent post that indicated you might already be working on
this.  If this is indeed the case, where are you on your effort and when do
you think you might have something that I can test with my new configuration
file?  No point in duplicating work!

Gary
