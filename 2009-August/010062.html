<PRE>Freddie,

I hope you will expand the INF files as people (like me) who provide the
updates they needed to make to get things working.

I think the finest quotes are from people who are happy it is working

<A HREF="http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2009-August/009851.htm">http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2009-August/009851.htm</A>
l

as opposed to what you quoted unhappy with the download speed

Those who need real speed can build it for themselves or use Linux
I bet the majority of the 1400 downloads just want something that works

Thanks for the distribution, it really helped me.

Freddie,

I appreciate all the effort that you have put into the Windows build,
and I hope you will continue to work with the community to improve it.

That does not make it acceptable for you to continue trolling here.
You are the one creating a problem here, antagonizing those of us who
want to respect the GPL license by attempting to label us as
fundamentalists.  I laugh at your obvious attempt at provocation.

If you have to answer questions over and over, then -- it seems quite
clear to me -- that your documentation fails to cover the required
procedures in sufficient detail or clarify.  That is not our failing.
It is yours -- if only for failing to provide patches that answer the
questions that you claim to be getting.  Your attempt to blame the
community for these shortcomings is positively unacceptable and
immature, and you look like a real jerk from where I am sitting. 

Let me blunt:  Fix the problems.  Stop whining.  I will not ignore
Windows users, unless they behave like you have.  Trolling is not now,
nor will it ever be, acceptable in this community.  So knock it off.

Cheers,

Zach

P.S.  I don't care what the problems are, since you apparently prefer to
bitch about them than to help to fix them.  This is directly a result of
trolling rather than being constructive, but I am still willing to help
those who help themselves.  You aren't.  This is the last reply you will
get from me until you change your attitude and approach this community
with more respect.
