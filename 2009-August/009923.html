Doh!  I completely overlooked the fact that 0.2.0 was out.  I
had tried Gentoo's openocd-9999 ebuild (which builds from the
svn trunk), and I couldn't get it to build for some reason:
emerge wouldn't even recognize the availabilty of the &quot;9999&quot;
version.

So anyway, it turns out that the 0.1.0 ebuild works fine with
0.2.0 sources, and the resulting openocd recognizes the board
and is able halt the CPU and examine memory and CPU registers.
It still doesn't connect on every attempt, but other than that
it's bascially working now.
