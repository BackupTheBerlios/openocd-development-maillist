<PRE>Hi All,
   Forgive my ignorance on this as I've never contributed to the open source
community before. I have attached jlink.c with some fixes.

   I'd recently gotten a mini2440 a samsung ARM9 based board.  I really
wanted to develop under linux and use openocd,  but it didn't work so I took
the problem to root cause.  Anway the 10 pin connectors do not connect RTCK
for adaptive clocking (very thoughtful), so when I built a cable adapter for
my JLINK it didn't work.. found out in the jlink_init() they said the
default to adaptive clocking which will fail with a 10 pin connector. So I
changed it to do what it would do normally, and if it failed, then to force
the clock to 1/2 max of the JLINK adapter (6 Mhz).  Seems to work fine on
the two jlink adapters I have tried it and shouldn't run any aditional code
if things are working peachy.

  I may be writting some more support code for this in a while (more flash
support, etc).. so I wanted to stay on the developer list so as I hear back
from members as this isn't how you do it, I won't do it this way in the
future.  My time is limited, but I will donate what I can and try to learn
the protocol for submitting fixes/additions.

     Best!

     Brian  from God's country in beautiful Nashua, NH USA
