Because users are not normally builders ... and should not be.
And even if they do build, that's a one-time thing; while the
users's guide is a use-regularly reference manual.

You don't get good documentation without focussing the audience
definition.  And the questions that come up when *using* software
are distinct from those related to building, testing, and releasing
that same software.


&gt;<i> Any general info a user needs to do to use OpenOCD belongs in the

</I>
That notion of &quot;the&quot; be-all/end-all/for-everyone manual is itself
a problem!  I have *never* seen it work well.

I think having focussed build directions is the right thing.  Zach
was one persion mentioning README.linux, README.nt, and similar
files with build instructions.  That's the way to go, IMO.  Easy
to keep those relatively up-to-date.  And they're clearly with the
part of the software (source code!) that is of interest to builders,
instead of users.  Plus there's no chicken/egg problem of needing
to build the software, and its docs, to read the build directions...

There might be an argument to have build docs with developer's
(internals) docs ... but that'd be weak, IMO, since there are
builders who *only* build/package and don't enhance the code.
And see above re chicken/egg.
