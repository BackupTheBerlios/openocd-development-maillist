<PRE>Hi &#216;yvind,

Yes, you are absolutely correct that configuration files are a lot of work
to put together.  And I might add critical too!  :)

One of the things I wanted to do is throw out some ideas for everyone to
think about as possible improvements to this configuration file development
process.  Some of the ideas are philosophical and don't have a right or
wrong answer.  They really are more intended to provoke a thoughtful
discussion even if they are never implemented:

1) One of the features that the software currently allows is configuration
setting inheritance from board to target to CPU.  While I generally am a big
advocate of extensibility in most software projects, I have been very leery
of doing this for hardware-specific configuration files.  Over every
person's career, many of battle scars are left behind.  And I have many on
mine that were related to nightmare debugger/emulator configuration problems
where I tried to inherit one thing from another.

The one danger with inheritance in this particular scenario is many people
will see a target and naturally glom onto it without giving too much thought
about the consequences.  Many processor families have rather incestuous
relationships that share many common details, but inevitably have
differences -- often very subtle ones.  These little details, however,
sometimes generate big consequences.

The other danger always lurking with the current approach is that it is
entirely possible one developer can make a change to the underlying root
target file without realizing that it may propagate undesirable changes into
higher-level board files.  Unfortunately these type of issues are not
typically discovered until much later.

For these two reasons, I wonder if it may not make more sense at some point
to discourage target configurations all together and encourage
self-sufficient board-level configuration files instead, even though this
normally goes against the grain of extensibility.

The key to making this work would be to break the directory structure along
processor models/manufactuer (i.e. arm926-ejs/atmel) and then lump
individual board configuration files under the appropriate directories.  If
a developer plans on using a particular processor in a design that doesn't
have an existing debugger configuration file, they quickly know which board
configuration files are likely to be similar and then clone it with little
risk of clobbering something else.

2)  One possible process improvement that I believe makes sense is to start
enforcing a rule that authors of new configuration files must include a
minimal comment header at the top of the file that specifies the exact
hardware/debugger combination used.  The SAM-ICE (J-link) debugger I am
using for example has a number of internal quirks that may not exist in
other brands and vice-versa.

Here again, it is possible for another developer to come along and use a
script with another debugger, find something that appears to be a bug, and
make a fix for their particular setup that now breaks it for the original
setup.

If for some reason, the approach described in 1) is adopted in the future,
the approach could further be extended by creating additional subdirectories
for emulator and version.  For example, the configuration file I created
would be filed under &quot;arm926ejs/atmel/at91sam9g20-ek/sam-ice/v8/file.cfg&quot; or
something similar.  This way if a developer is using a future version 123
dongle that has new quirks, there is less risk of corrupting older debugger
configurations that other people may still be using.

3) One feature that I think may make sense to add at some point in the
future to the main software is support for label/value associations that
allow hexadecimal register values to be associated with more legible and
understandable names.  Looking at &quot;mww 0xffff3ec2 0x2&quot; in a configuration
script is more likely to introduce mistakes during reuse, then say &quot;mww
some_xyz_register 0x2&quot; where the name of the register clues you into what it
does or at least where to find it in the datasheet.

Anyway like I said, these ideas I propose are just that and nothing more.  I
realize that other good arguments exist for keeping things the way they are
and there is nothing wrong with that either.  And admittedly, the ideas I
propose here have their own share of thorns too!

Food for thought!  :)

Gary
