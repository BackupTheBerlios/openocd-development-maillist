Ah, I assumed it was part of your changes. In that case it would be
another patch, not for this one.
I don't know if there's anyone else around to chime in, when I was
adding my stuff a couple of months ago there wan't many other
commentators, Peter Stuge gave a lot of assistance but it was more to
do with good coding style and logical layout rather than the actual
svf handling. SVF really is a rarely touched module from what I can
tell.
