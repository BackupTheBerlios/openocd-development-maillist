Crimping your own is not hard with something solid to push down with (bit of wood or such).

imo basic soldering / electrical skills are part of being an embedded engineer, if you want to play around trying to fit square pegs in round holes.

To abuse a famous quote; give a man a vendor cable and he can program one board. Teach him to fabricate his own cables..
