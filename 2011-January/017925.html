Correct :-) These are the basic bus operations, wehere trn and parity
bit is also an operation in libswd for easier implementation (also
bitbang/bistream flush can be used from char array). Data can be
directly queued up on the *cmdq (command bidirectional queue) or first
bitstream can be generated for those operations and then queued up on
the *cmdq - there are helper functions already implemented that
realize this bistream, so no need to write them from scratch - ie. you
only need to provide addres, operation type and access port and helper
function will build request - then the request byte can be put on the
queue. This way we can put data on the queue and have good overview of
what is happening on the bus (swd-viewer), also something like svf
record can be done, wehere all transactions are stored on the queue
and then flushed out to file and then replayed with external software.

&gt;<i> Sounds like a bit-level description of most any
</I>&gt;<i> SWD wire transaction...
</I>
If versalon driver needs packey payload anywas and does not construct
it itself, then you can use libswd helper functions to easily create
those data. If so it perfectly matches current libswd abilities, but
the problem also might occur when it is the cable itself that
constructs the bitstream from parameters like address, access port,
etc.

&gt;&gt;<i> In that case it might be easy to abstract
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> libswd/versaloon.
</I>
Exactly! I am aware that still libswd is not yet functional but it
will be in a short time. Also this is good time to request
functionalities :-)

&gt;&gt;<i> How is this not already done in the SWD
</I>&gt;<i> transpsort defs? Implementations of the SWD
</I>&gt;<i> ops to read/write registers must do those
</I>&gt;<i> bitop sequences as driver ops.
</I>
The trick is that libswd can be standalone, it was written for another
purpose, but the integration with other utilities is critial, so I
have created something like abstraction layer - where there are
functions that can do TRN, BIT8 read/write and BIT32 read/write. The
trick is to have as low functions as possible that could flush the
queue out/into physical driver (or anything other utilizing existing
higher level drivers). TRN must be separate function to work on the
interface buffers. bit shift can be input or output and done from char
and int data type, so I have created two functions that will flush
n-bits, lsb/msb-first from char and int type. These functions are
driver specific, located in external file and separate for openocd,
urjtag and others.. please tahe a look at libswd_drv.c but these
functions are still open for constructive criticism as work in
progress (unfinished) :-)

I hope this libswd organization is not too complex and in some ways
comfortable - if it prove itself, maybe after some modifications (and
lots of bugfixes), these utilities would be able to easily create
other serial transports such as spi, i2c, 1wire, and many others using
exiting cables that we already own :-)

Best regards! :-)
Tomek
