Nice! :-) OpenOCD has already great infrastructure implemented and it
will surely allow many other transport implemented. Maybe it would be
convenient to separate, create or wrap initialization functions and
structures somehow to avoid using jtag_* functions in other
transports..?

&gt;<i> I have sucessfully run SWD under the tranport framework, but some changes:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. call&#160;jtag_register_commands in swd_select, because these commands are
</I>&gt;<i> needed when parsing configuration files
</I>
Maybe this could be done by creating swd_register_commands based on
jtag_register_commands, renaming it into core_register_commands or
wrapping with transport_register_commands?

&gt;<i> 2. ignore jtag calls in core.c and tcl.c in SWD mode.
</I>
How these can be ignored? I think the best solution would be not to
have any alien calls within specified transport, so the tranports are
separate of each other, even when more than one transport it in use -
this could allow for instance using JTAG/SWD and SPI for FPGA
prototyping/development when SPI memory is directly programmed by
cable and the same cable could use JTAG/SWD for debug.

&gt;<i> 3. add&#160;queue_dp_scan to&#160;struct dap_ops, so that in arm_adi_v5.c,
</I>&gt;<i> dap_ops-&gt;&#160;queue_dp_scan&#160;is called instead of&#160;adi_jtag_dp_scan.
</I>
Great! And the queue is being used by existing infrastructure..?

&gt;<i> 4. clear error registers:
</I>&gt;<i> In JTAG:
</I>&gt;<i> dap_queue_dp_write(dap, DP_CTRL_STAT, SSTICKYERR);
</I>&gt;<i> In SWD:
</I>&gt;<i> dap_queue_dp_write(dap, DP_ABORT, DAPABORT | STKERRCLR | WDERRCLR |
</I>&gt;<i> ORUNERRCLR);
</I>
Wow, this is really nice and I was wondering how such high-level
access could look - this one is very comfortable! :-)

Simon, do you know how the command queue can be realized to replay all
of the commands that are stored in a file (ie. something like svf
player). Still I dont really understand how such &quot;past&quot; command can be
executed from the longer queue with additional parameters such as
error flags and if its possible - those flags must have its own
structure to be put on the queue with the command? Do you have
experience with such stuff? This is simple when executing commands at
real time because error flags can be directly supplied into calling
function, but when it is one of many commands queued, then after each
step there must be some additional function checking for an error.. so
how to filter out some resulting bits in a universal manner, or simply
blindly replay the queue and stop when driver function returns error?

We could also create high-level command for data transfer polling for
potential transfer errors (they would consist of data phase and
CTLSTAT register read to verify the sticky flags), or these should be
done with external tcl scripts using simple hardcoded functions?

Best regards,
Tomek
