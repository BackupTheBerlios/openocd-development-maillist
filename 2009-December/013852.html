<PRE>I'm fooling with a cable modem that has a MIPS 4kc processor and cfi 
type flash chip from ST: M28W160CT.  Flash configuration is as follows:

flash bank cfi 0x90000000 0X200000 2 2 $_TARGETNAME

openocd-0.2.0 has no problem detecting the flash with &quot;flash_probe&quot;

Some other differences I've noted between version 2 and the last two 
releases is in regards to endian ness.
Dump_image in version 2 produces an output file where the ascii text 
(within the dump file) is in human  readable order.  The dumps with 
version 3 and 4 produce an image where the text is rotated or flipped.  
I've not been able to &quot;load_image&quot; with any version successfully or 
&quot;flash write_image&quot;.  It does, however erase the flash in version two.

To solve my dilemma,  I modified the source code to &quot;HairyDairyMaid's&quot; 
router debrick utility, which interestingly, some of the MIPS_4kc 
(openocd) source is based on.  With the debrick utility, I was able to 
detect, read, erase, and write to the modem I was &quot;tampering&quot; with :).  
I WISH I could use Openocd for this task as I could use some of the 
additional TCL scripting features to automate testing and debugging. 

I've tried a few modifications by compairing the source from version 2 
to 3 and have not had success.   I'm reasonably certain my config file 
is not the issue, but I could be wrong.

Regards,

Mr. Smith
