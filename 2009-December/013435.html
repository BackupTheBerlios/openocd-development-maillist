That &quot;mostly done&quot; bothers me... we need to be winding down current
work which is almost completely merged, not starting a new merge
cycle just to get in &quot;under the wire&quot;.  So I'm going to read this
instead as mostly about things which might be done in 0.5 ... and
most of which doesn't relate to $SUBJECT, for that matter!


If by $SUBJECT you mean &quot;remove JTAG-related global state from
all interfaces&quot;, I'm all for it.

But probably not for 0.4 since it's a huge change ... it would
touch *EVERYTHING* that gets anywhere near JTAG.  Like for example
the TAP state logic, and SRST handling, &quot;reset_config&quot;, and more.

Such a change would need to go in phases.  Maybe some of them could
fit in the remaining part of the 0.4 cycle; but not most of them.

(None of that is sanely factored; the &quot;fact&quot; that there's just one
current JTAG scan chain, TAP state, SRST etc, is *everywhere* in the
code.  Even when it's not actually true, e.g. SRST is a pretty rude
signal to try using, unless there's only a single device.)

And then that would need to bubble up to the command language
too.  Maybe in a different release -- but eventually.  In short,
supporting multiple scan chains would be a major change, not
IMO suitable for rushing into the 0.4 release.

</I>
Any time I hear about a proposed &quot;struct object&quot;, warning
sirens start blaring loudly.  They're almost never needed,
except maybe as part of enabling GC in a language runtime.

You can add the notion of a loadable module separately from
all that other stuff.  

Loadable _driver_ does call for a clean framework into which
that driver plugs ... and none of our drivers are that clean:
we rely on tables, rather than ${TYPE}_driver_{add,remove}()
calls that get triggered somehow.  Where TYPE could of course
be JTAG adapter, CPU/target, NOR driver, NAND driver, and more.

It ought to be easy to drop lots of drivers out of the tree,
by just not compiling and linking them -- without changing
the framework into which they plug.  Then later to tweak
those frameworks to say &quot;hmm, no &lt;driver X&gt;, try modprobe
to see if it appears&quot;.  The enabling comes from just having
clean register-a-driver-to-this-subsystem interfaces.


&gt;<i> - flash driver/instance unification
</I>&gt;<i>   - NOR tree is converted to use 'object' and 'driver' model.
</I>&gt;<i>     - flash_banks are 'object's of flash_driver device 'driver's
</I>&gt;<i>   - NAND tree can be converted similarly (when done with other patches).
</I>
Maybe you could start a separate thread on this subject,
showing precisely what you mean.  Your single quotes prevent
me from understanding what that &quot;flash_banks are...&quot; means.

There's obvious messiness to clean up there, but I'd have to
guess what you're intending to suggest...


&gt;<i> - multiple JTAG interface API support (internal to the JTAG module only)
</I>&gt;<i>   - adds jtag_device (object) to instantiate jtag_interface (driver)
</I>
Seems to me the notions we need here would be:

  - scan chain, associated with
      * state ... collected from all over: reset config, etc
      * set of TAPs ... state; some TAPs have targets
      * jtag adapter ... driver, with internal state

So hook up multiple adapters, and get multiple scan chains each with
their own TAPs and each of which gets reset differently.

A &quot;jtag_device&quot; would be conceptually confusing; everything we touch
is some flavor of that.  Focus instead on what role the device serves,
and make type names match the role.


&gt;<i>   - converts internal APIs: jtag_interface, driver commands, bitbang
</I>&gt;<i>   - converts drivers to use new APIs, with dummy support many instances
</I>&gt;<i>   - moves some global variables into structures
</I>
Hmm, I'd rather see the &quot;what&quot; (data structures) before the &quot;how do
we get there&quot; (conversion steps).


&gt;<i> So far, the JTAG conversion has been completely internal to that module,
</I>&gt;<i> so it may not be desirable to introduce this support in 0.4.0 without
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;finishing&quot; the work.  Specifically, support must be added at all levels
</I>&gt;<i> of the system; many of the public JTAG APIs must be updated so callers
</I>&gt;<i> pass the required jtag_device structure.  This process of associating
</I>&gt;<i> all of the other parts of the system with a specific interface will take
</I>&gt;<i> a larger concerted effort, and it may be too late to get this done.
</I>&gt;<i> Even worse, we must integrate this somehow with the current commands. :/
</I>
It's way too late for 0.4, IMO.

The &quot;easy&quot; way to package such a change would be to have one telnet and
TCL port per scan chain, so the *runtime* commands don't need to change.

But that'd still leave a mess for the configuration problem.  I think
all the work you've done refactoring the command handling ought to be
able to help sort that out.

 
&gt;<i> Today, the patches allow updating the internal JTAG APIs to support
</I>&gt;<i> multiple interfaces and allow drivers to encapsulate their own state.
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, I have updated the 'dummy' driver to show how multiple device
</I>&gt;<i> instances can be supported in one driver with the new interface APIs.
</I>
Getting rid of static (presumably!) per-driver state sounds like it's
something that might safely get merged for 0.4 ... at least, &quot;enabling&quot;,
plus maybe converting a few drivers.  It wouldn't suffice for making
multiple JTAG interfaces work, but it's obviously a necessary step.

Maybe you could post the interface change patch (there is just one??)
for discussion.

Also, the Zylin stuff seems to presuppose there can't be multiple
JTAG adapters -- so that it can inline fragments implementing the
single adapter all over the place.  That's not necessarily in big
conflict with well designed hooks; just a compile time option to
turn most of them into stubs.  (And for that matter, GCC does have
the &quot;-fwhole-program --combine&quot; optimizations which have helped in
similar cases.)


&gt;<i> When the high-level APIs switch away from using a global device pointer,
</I>&gt;<i> that driver should just work as expected.  Others maintainers should
</I>&gt;<i> find it easy to update their own drivers to add this support, even
</I>&gt;<i> though this requires removing all post-configuration global variables.

</I>&gt;<i> While I am going to continue looking at the JTAG layer, I believe that
</I>&gt;<i> this current work would be relatively safe to push.  It might be best to
</I>&gt;<i> do this integration in stages so each phase gets good testing, but what
</I>&gt;<i> do others think about these changes and overall strategy?
</I>
Hmm, I'll have to make time to look at all that.  For now, my bias
is that none of this is *needed* for 0.4 ... so I'd say to hold off.

Reviewing code in a repository isn't a good way to go, IMO.  I'd
rather see emails proposing interface changes -- first as overview
for discussion, eventually in the form of a reviewable patch -- with
perhaps a brief overview of where those changes are leading, in some
cases.

Plus, having a *small* number of changes to review at a time is a
lot easier to cope with than a wall of patches...
