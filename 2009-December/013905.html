My l33t mind-reading powers have improved.  I knew you were
going to say that!  ;)

I'm looking specifically at an FT2232 based link that I have
in hand.  Looks like the main issue will be making sure that
the ADIv5.c stuff makes effective use of what it calls the
TRANS_MODE_COMPOSITE mode ... which also speeds performance
going through JTAG.

That is, the way to do this with an FT2232 involves more or 
less just a GPIO control whether SWDIO connects to MOSI as
output, or MISO as input.  That switches with no round-trip.

 
&gt;<i> So far we've seen huge disruptive patches that didn't fit
</I>&gt;<i> naturally with OpenOCD 
</I>
It'll be a significant evolution, since SWD != JTAG.  Many
things will need to change.  But agreed, they should not be
as disruptive as those patches were
.


&gt;<i> and for something like SWD, I 
</I>&gt;<i> think we want more speed than haste when committing it.
</I>
As in, &quot;If you don't have the time to do it right,
how will you find the time to do it over?&quot;  :)
