<PRE>Hi David, hi all,


first of all i have to say that it was not my intention to upset
the developers here. Sorry. I was very happy that you
fix the R13_svc bug in the second i had report it..

&gt;&gt;<i> I agree. Nonetheless this error shouldn't occur in the official
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> snapshot on the website.
</I>&gt;<i> I must have missed the notice that *during the merge window* it
</I>&gt;<i> became reasonable to treat arbitrary snapshots as being release
</I>&gt;<i> quality.  Could you point out some agreement where that changed??
</I>
No, they don't have to. They even can be not functional
at all or contains errors. I agree.
The error i mentioned was in 0.31.
I will check that again and report it.
I don't mean the r13_svc!

&gt;<i> Somehow I had always thought that development trees were expected to
</I>&gt;<i> have short term minor breakage every now and then.  That's just part
</I>&gt;<i> of how things work.
</I>
Yes, right.

&gt;&gt;<i> In this case the $SUBJECT goof had been fixed in the tree for at
</I>&gt;<i> least a day when you complained.  It appeared only on a platform that
</I>&gt;<i> most of the developers don't actually use ... yet still it was in the
</I>&gt;<i> tree for less than eighteen hours.
</I>
Yes, that was perfect.
I don't mean r13_svc here!
I mean the official 0.31.
 
Best Regards,



Carsten
