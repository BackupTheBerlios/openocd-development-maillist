<PRE>I'm concerned about doing a lot more work on 0.4. I would
like to see what our track record is with this amount of changes
w.r.t. breakage.

The changes you are proposing look *great* but I wonder if
they shouldn't be spread out over 0.4, 0.5 and possibly
also 0.6 to get enough feedback on the work along
the way.

I'm also concerned about such a major change
as introducing support for multiple interfaces where I have
yet to hear anybody actually needing to do such a thing
in-process. It greatly improves the architecture for sure
and the code will be more pleasurable to read &amp; work
on, important in an open source project in itself. I would
put symmetric parallel processing way above it, but I
have yet to hear such requests even.

When it comes to cleaning up global state(a precursor to
multiple jtag interfacs), then my favorite would be
to abolish jtag_set_end_state(). Even &quot;simply&quot; getting
rid of jtag_set_end_state() would require a *vast* amount
of regression testing on real hardware.

While putting the end_state into the interface structure would
&quot;work&quot; it would be lipstick on a pig, I would much rather
push the end state into the target layer. Presumably
there would be no need to coordinate end state across a
heterogeneous JTAG chain or if there were, then I suspect
a naive concept of a global end state per interface would
be insufficient.

What I would like to see pushed before 0.4 are sweeping
changes with low risk profile, so as to make branches
easier to maintain.
