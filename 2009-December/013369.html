Today, I started looking into the possibility of adding Lua for
precisely this reason.  I think it would be a good fit for us, and it
would ensure that the decoupled APIs are both complete and robust.  I
think that calling Lua from TCL (and vice-versa) would be doable too.
It might be scary and inefficient, but it would be interesting. ;)

&gt;<i> &gt; That would take a lot of extra work, but the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; preparation would yield solid architectural improvements to the system.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Even if we never do that (and there's no reason to), the system will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cleaner for our efforts; it's classic model-view-controller separation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> True, the cleanup is worth-while.  But don't think that cleanup

</I>&gt;<i> tasks want the same things decoupled!
</I>
Yeah, the ZY1000 minidriver has shown that clearly in recent days;
however, that gives rise to my claim that some couplings may be
indications of fundamental flaws in the design of the structures and
algorithms being used.

&gt;<i> Having a few alternate applications signed up to using the APIs
</I>&gt;<i> would be the best way to make sure they're really &quot;generic&quot;.
</I>
A test suite will do this for us.  That's one reason that I am pushing
so hard for this.  I won't bother to write one until things are cleaner,
because it just means rewriting it... a lot.
