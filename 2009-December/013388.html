When does OpenOCD do shallow copying of such contexts?  That
kind of detail is stuff I've not had to observe... :)

Hmm ... this sounds like a mechanism not being used well!

Lexical scoping is a Good Thing, and builds on such hiding.
Requiring everything to be globally scoped ... not ideal.


Have you thought about having a tree of command contexts?
Possibly modeled with stack push/pop type primitives.  Have
builtin Jim primitives in the base context, various OpenOCD
addons next, and then a scan chain ... with each target its
own context, with unique operations.


I confess to not having dived into this part of the code, but
at a glance it seems like &quot;command context&quot; might be the most
natural structuring tool that lets us get away from globals.

(Previous hand-wavey comments from me said &quot;interpreter&quot;, which
was the appropriate abstraction in one system I used.  And in
this one, it's not unrelated -- interpreters do have private
state.  But, it seems, just for Jim stuff; not for all the
OpenOCD machinery.)


That is, while there can be $TARGETNAME objects in a context
with subcommands ... having $TARGETNAME be the current target
might be the same as just stacking it as a context.  Its sundry
commands might then be accessible without a $TARGETNAME prefix.
Likewise, scan chain (or board) specific scopes, and commands
needed to work with that chain/board.  A &quot;proc ...&quot; declaration
would go into the current context

If you're keen on growing OpenOCD to support multiple JTAG
adapters, and thus multiple scan chains ... I would think
that having a clean way to scope things would be near the
top of the list of necessary structural changes.
