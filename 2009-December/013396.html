Pushed the fix.

&gt;<i> &gt; So I add that missing call, and now I see the various flash

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and not-helpful output, but output.  (This command used to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be post-processed by some TCL stuff.)
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> handler.  Thoughts, before I dive into this?
</I>
Too late.  I pushed a patch (with a braindead wrong comment), so we can
get the old output with 'flash_banks'.  I suppose that a real solution
is in order, but I cannot think of how to restore this without rather
drastic measures.  Comments?

&gt;<i> &gt; But now I can't &quot;flash probe 0&quot; ... why?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Given the amount of change that's occurred in that module lately, it
</I>&gt;<i> would be nice to know when I broke it.  I will try to figure it out from
</I>&gt;<i> casual inspection, but I probably need more details on this one.
</I>
I tested it here.  Naturally, it works fine for me with the above fixes
in place.  Until I hear more, I am not going to investigate this piece
of the puzzle further.
