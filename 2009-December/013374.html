I agree completely.  Scheme is totally viable too, on par with Lua.
These are both viable.  Personally, I think that I have talked myself
into Jimv2 as the second language, adding Lua, Scheme, or another as a
third language that seals the encapsulation and re-use deal.

&gt;<i>From what you said about Go in the past, I like the idea... except for
</I>the fact that OpenOCD will not be thread-safe anytime soon.  But even if
we could fix that, I am not sure exactly how we could benefit from it,
when we have bottlenecks other than the CPU.  Right?

But just to cover the bases of crazy, why not just make OpenOCD a
back-end to LLVM.... ;)  With libopenocd, that should not be infeasible,
as far as I can understand.
