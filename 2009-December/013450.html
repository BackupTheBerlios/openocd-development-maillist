<PRE>This discussion comes up every so often. I don't see
that anything has changed.

There hasn't been any interest from the maintainers to switch and
it would be a major undertaking to do this. Getting the consensus
and convincing everybody to come on board would be a huge
undertaking in itself. You can't force anybody, so you would have to
provide clear and compelling evidence for real benefits. You're up
against a crowd that are aware of all the C++ language features and
still said no.

I do recognize that some oo feature found in C++(polymorphism,
exception handling, interfaces, etc.) are implemented more or less elegantly
in OpenOCD compared to being supported in the language.

Personally I think that exception handling and resource tracking
would be the greatest wins. A language defined OO mechanism
(subclassing, interfaces) would also be nice. I actually think
with exception handling and resource tracking done right, we could
see a *tiny* improvement in performance of critical functions. I use
Java, C++ and C across various projects. For OpenOCD we could
do worse than C. Ada anyone? :-)

At this point I just don't see anything that would compel us to switch.

Zach has been talking about libopenocd and one of the bindings
could be the language of your choice though.

I kinda hope that openocd will stay a core library that centers around
interfaces, targets and scripting for the targets rather than growing out
of all proportions to cover lots of other more or less related subject matter.
