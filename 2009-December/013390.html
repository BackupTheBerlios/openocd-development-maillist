See copy_command_context(). :)

I have looked to improve it, but there could be a lot of work for
relatively little reward.

</I>
I am very much interested in more encapsulation, but your proposal
implies a lot of work with the current command set.  I think it will be
better to finish separating mechanism and policy, implementing these
extensions in a parallel command language, and making a flag day of it.

&gt;<i> I confess to not having dived into this part of the code, but
</I>&gt;<i> at a glance it seems like &quot;command context&quot; might be the most
</I>&gt;<i> natural structuring tool that lets us get away from globals.
</I>
Yes.  I have been looking at adding generic context mechanisms to solve
these problems.  I have not found a solution that will KISS.

&gt;<i> (Previous hand-wavey comments from me said &quot;interpreter&quot;, which
</I>&gt;<i> was the appropriate abstraction in one system I used.  And in
</I>&gt;<i> this one, it's not unrelated -- interpreters do have private
</I>&gt;<i> state.  But, it seems, just for Jim stuff; not for all the
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD machinery.)
</I>
Right... I intend to piggyback on the Jim stuff, but in a way that
encapsulates it from the rest of the system.  Under the hood, this
should be portable to Lua, Scheme, etc.... ;)

&gt;<i> That is, while there can be $TARGETNAME objects in a context
</I>&gt;<i> with subcommands ... having $TARGETNAME be the current target
</I>&gt;<i> might be the same as just stacking it as a context.  Its sundry
</I>&gt;<i> commands might then be accessible without a $TARGETNAME prefix.
</I>&gt;<i> Likewise, scan chain (or board) specific scopes, and commands
</I>&gt;<i> needed to work with that chain/board.  A &quot;proc ...&quot; declaration
</I>&gt;<i> would go into the current context
</I>
Did you see my proposal to have 'command proc foo bar baz {} {}' syntax?
Does the same thing you're saying, but with less context. ;)
And you could 'eval' such a statement to dynamically scope it....

I am not keen on the idea of the user being able to specify a &quot;current
context&quot; that temporarily changes the implied root of the command tree,
which seems to be what you're suggesting.  I would rather have us
standardize on a idiomatic nomenclature that provides a unified syntax
for single target systems that meshes with complex configurations too.

&gt;<i> If you're keen on growing OpenOCD to support multiple JTAG
</I>&gt;<i> adapters, and thus multiple scan chains ... I would think
</I>&gt;<i> that having a clean way to scope things would be near the
</I>&gt;<i> top of the list of necessary structural changes.
</I>
Yeah, clearly there remain some missing bells and whistles.

[[Rant about how new features would pay better than cleanup deleted.]]
