<PRE>Hi Michael,

Thanks for all the comments Good to know that I might be on the track.

Here are my comments/questions:
&gt;<i> So something goes wrong when running the programming algorithm on the
</I>target. One possible area would be the command-completion check, where
the toggle/error bits differ between manufacturers.

OK, is it possible to alter/verify this?

&gt;<i> When running the programming algorithm on target (with working area),
</I>can you program the SST39VF6401 flash on the same board? What about a
different flash with command set 02 (eg. Spansion)?

I don't have the SSTVF396401 flash and I am 90% SW guy so soldering a
new flash onto the board is difficult for me. However if it is the only
way forward I will be able to do it but not until the 5. of January
because of missing equipment.


&gt;<i> The question being: is this a problem with the SST flash, or is this a
</I>general problem with target-based programming on the CPU you use?

The flash programming works fine with the exact same CPU:LPC2468 on an
embedded artist board with SST 39VF3201 flash. The only change I made to
my script is the Flash size as that flash is a 4M.

&gt;&gt;<i> Q3: Does this &quot;command set&quot; difference mean that I am in the same
</I>kind of trouble as some of the other people I read about are having? 
&gt;<i>  I do not know what kind of trouble you are talking about - I can't
</I>remember any unresolved CFI/non-CFI flash problems related to command
sets on this list in the lasts few months. Do you have a pointer to such
a discussion?

Ohh maybe I got it wrong. I was referring to posts similar to this:
<A HREF="http://forum.sparkfun.com/viewtopic.php?t=4272">http://forum.sparkfun.com/viewtopic.php?t=4272</A>

But they do refer to &quot;CFI&quot; flashes...

Does this help in understanding my problem?

Regards Flemming

&gt;<i>   
</I>It seems so, although the datasheet talk about CFI support.

However, the datasheet talks about a three-byte command to enter CFI
mode, which is in conflict with the CFI spec. I remember some older SST
flashs had the same problem (and when using the 3-byte sequence, the CFI
tables were present, but broken).

If the 39VF6401B behaves like that, it is probably best to treat it as a
non-CFI device.

&gt;<i> All this does not help me very much as I cannot flash anything to this
</I>flash, here are my observations: 
&gt;<i> 1. I can get a flash info and then all blocks are in a &quot;protection
</I>state unknown&quot; condition. This can be solved by applying a &quot;flash
protect_check 1&quot;. Then a &quot;flash info 1&quot; says that every block is
protected. 
&gt;<i> 2. I can disable the &quot;working area&quot; and then it seems to flash but
</I>very slowly and pretty useless with an 8M flash. This leads me into
thinking that chipselect and all these things are OK.?
&gt;<i>   
</I>It also means that the command set and programming algorithm work fine.
Without the workspace, the whole programming algorithm runs on the host,
using seperate word accesses to the flash.

&gt;<i> 3. The flash I am using is identified to have &quot;CFI Query string&quot; where
</I>&quot; Primary OEM command set = 0002H @ address 13H&quot; Whereas my Embedde
Aritist board flash that works nicely has a &quot;command set = 01H&quot;. 
&gt;<i>   
</I>01 is Intel/Sharp, 02 is AMD/Fujitsu. The commands in the datasheet seem
to match the AMD command set, so using that seems fine. Since other
AMD-style flashs work fine, this is probably not the problem.

&gt;<i> My OpenOCD 0.3.1 is simply throwing this kind of message after me :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> non-cfi flash: 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> mfr: 0x00bf, id:0x236d 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Error: timed out while waiting for target halted 
</I>&gt;<i> Error: error writing to flash at address 0x80000000 at offset
</I>0x00000000 (-902)
&gt;<i>   
</I>So something goes wrong when running the programming algorithm on the
target. One possible area would be the command-completion check, where
the toggle/error bits differ between manufacturers.


&gt;<i> Here are some more observations, which might be relevant:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The SST39VF6401B and SST39VF6401 are not the same e.g. Primary OEM
</I>command set are 01H vs 02H
&gt;<i>   
</I>When running the programming algorithm on target (with working area),
can you program the SST39VF6401 flash on the same board? What about a
different flash with command set 02 (eg. Spansion)?

The question being: is this a problem with the SST flash, or is this a
general problem with target-based programming on the CPU you use?

&gt;<i> The SST39VFXX01 and SSTVFXX02 differs in working with Top vs Bottom
</I>boot blocks, whatever that means...
&gt;<i>   
</I>That is only the sector layout - bootblock flashs have some sectors that
are smaller than the majority of sectors, for storing bootcode, and
these may be at the beginning or at the end of the flash - which variant
you need depends on where your CPU fetches its reset vector.

&gt;<i> Q1: Does any of the things I did make sence (someone suggested that
</I>the device really is a CFI Flash and my effort is a waste of time - how
can I know)? 
&gt;<i>   
</I>After a close look at the datasheet, I think you did the right thing -
SST claims the flash to be CFI compliant, but the datasheet tells that
it is not.

&gt;<i> Q3: Does this &quot;command set&quot; difference mean that I am in the same kind
</I>of trouble as some of the other people I read about are having? 
&gt;<i>   
</I>I do not know what kind of trouble you are talking about - I can't
remember any unresolved CFI/non-CFI flash problems related to command
sets on this list in the lasts few months. Do you have a pointer to such
a discussion?
