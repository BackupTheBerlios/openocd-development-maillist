<PRE>Hi Michael,

I will stop referring to the &quot;obscure forum&quot;:-)

You are right there are very little differences from the 39VF6401B flash
to some of its predecessors.

I used &quot;Beyond Compare to compare the SST39VF16/32/64-01 and the
39VF640XB specs, and besides 5555H vs 555H and 2AAAH vs 2AAH differences
I also noticed another difference between the 39VFXXXX and 39VFXXXXB.

Taken from the SST 39VF6401B spec:

&quot;This is that some erase command has been swapped(This is for the
39VF6401B):
The Sector- (or Block-) Erase operation allows the system 
to erase the device on a sector-by-sector (or block-byblock) 
basis. The SST39VF640xB offer both Sector-Erase 
and Block-Erase mode. The sector architecture is based 
on uniform sector size of 2 KWord. The Block-Erase mode 
is based on uniform block size of 32 KWord. The Sector-
Erase operation is initiated by executing a six-byte command 
sequence with Sector-Erase command (50H) and 
sector address (SA) in the last bus cycle. The Block-Erase 
operation is initiated by executing a six-byte command 
sequence with Block-Erase command (30H) and block 
address (BA) in the last bus cycle. The sector or block 
address is latched on the falling edge of the sixth WE# 
pulse, while the command (50H or 30H) is latched on the 
rising edge of the sixth WE# pulse....&quot;

For the SST39VF16/32/64-01 specification the 30H and 50H is swapped is
this maybe taken care of by the 2 different command sets already?

Is this Block/Sector Erase even being used during the normal flash
process?

How can I learn more about the commands sets?

Sorry for all the questions:-)

Regards Flemming

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Hm. From a quick look, I did not see anything strange in the 39VF6401B
datasheet that would explain the differences.

Unfortunately, the biggest SST flash I have here in my collection is the
39VF3201, so this is no help for you.


&gt;<i> kind of trouble as some of the other people I read about are having?

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Hm - are you serious?
You use a post on some obscure web forum, more than 3 years out of date,
as reference?
Even if a current problem is described there, how should the OpenOCD
developers know about it?

Support for AMD/Spansion CFI flash has been in OpenOCD for quite some
time, and works great - otherwise, you would not be able to program the
39VF3201, either.

I just pulled current openocd-git and plugged an EON EN29LV640L into my
development board (I have sockets for those TSOP48 flashs - too bad
Yamaichi stopped making them when ROHS came up):

JTAG tap: ipx42x.cpu tap/device found: 0x19277013 (mfg: 0x009, part:
0x9277, ver: 0x1)
target state: halted
target halted in ARM state due to debug-request, current mode:
Supervisor
cpsr: 0x000000d3 pc: 0x00000000
MMU: disabled, D-Cache: disabled, I-Cache: disabled
(processor reset)
XSCALE_CTRL (/32): 0x000000F8
Flash Manufacturer/Device: 0x007f 0x227e
configuration specifies 0x200000 size, but a 0x800000 size flash was
found
flash 'cfi' found at 0x50000000
&gt;<i> uboot
</I>protect: cfi primary command set 2 unsupported
cleared protection for sectors 0 through 10 on flash bank 0
auto erase enabled
wrote 262144 bytes from file /tftpboot/actux1/u-boot.bin in 10.847293s
(23.600 kb/s)

This is definitely an AMD (02) commandset flash.

(BTW: that write speed looks great - I was used to get around 12KB/s
using my parport adapter)

SST 39VF3201 works fine on my board, too, but I don't have a 39VF6401 to
test.
