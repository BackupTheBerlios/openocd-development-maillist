Your problem signal is TDO (that's giving &quot;all ones&quot; output), so
this looks like the right track...

Looks to me like the way they added SWO support involved adding
an additional control signal, which the previous revision didn't
use.  And thus, the previous OpenOCD driver didn't use... so one
theory is that said signal is driven wrong, disabling JTAG.

In the best of worlds, they used the same signal as various other
boards, so you could just switch to the other interface config
(which doesn't advertise itself as being for the '811 board).
ISTR those go through CPLDs ... this one seems not to do that,
I mis-remembered.

Less optimally you'd have to tweak src/jtag/driver/ft2232.c to
understand this as yet another variant.
