Yes.  Cases where NULL is valid should get such checks.  But that's
self-evident, and not the interesting case.


&gt;<i> In library APIs where it's impossible to determine such pre-conditions,
</I>&gt;<i> they must be checked... or we have a buggy library.
</I>
And that's the issue I was highlighting.  By calling that a &quot;buggy&quot;
library you are extending its specification.  It's possible to define
them in that way ... but it's fairly widely understood to be costly,
enough so that such definitions are unusual.

Such spec extensions enlarge the scope of what must be tested, hurt
performance in several ways, and increase system complexity.  In some
cases those tradeoffs are worth making in that way; not often.

I admit that when I first came across it, the &quot;don't check for NULL&quot;
philosophy seemed pretty wrong.  But, quite a few years later on, now
I see that it's quite effective.  The &quot;it's wrong&quot; argument is on micro
scales.  The &quot;it's right&quot; one is macro scale.  For every small micro win,
there are many more large macro wins.


&gt;<i> &gt; I'm personally used to the answer to that being &quot;no&quot;, and being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; able to rely on inputs being non-NULL ... unless they're explicitly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stated as allowing NULL.
</I>
If you pass a NULL where the function spec requires that the parameter
not be NULL, there is only one action which is in all cases clearly
incorrect:  passing the NULL in the first place.


Anything else is down to a choice of policies about how to handle
such run time errors.  &quot;Implementation choices&quot;.  One choice being:

&gt;<i> If the NULL can derive _only_ from programming error, then the assert()
</I>&gt;<i> macro should be used instead. 
</I>
Note that the difference between an assert() failure and what
happens when you actually indirect through a NULL pointer (on
sane systems!) is *ONLY* in which diagnostic is emitted ... which
includes SIGSEGV or nothing-at-all, vs &quot;assertion failure&quot;.


&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not sure what you mean to imply by that NULL example, but the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; two philosophies I'm aware of are:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - Having largely superfluous NULL checks obfuscates the code and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    makes it less clear.  If anyone wrongly passes a NULL, we get a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    nice fast-fail that's easily tracked down and fixed.  Plus, there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    is a *LOT* of code (and runtime cycles) wasted on such checks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This model falls down in embedded devices and under heavy load with
</I>&gt;<i> dynamic memory allocation.  In neither case will it be remotely easy for
</I>&gt;<i> the user of the device or application to produce a viable crash report.
</I>
That &quot;dynamic memory allocation&quot; presupposes bugs of the &quot;didn't
check for allocation failure&quot; ... those happen to be bugs which
static analysis tools are pretty good at surfacing.  Or even GCC
with the warn_unused_result machinery.  So that's a non-issue in
any reasonable development model.  (Worth checking that OpenOCD is
kicking in that function attribute ... also the &quot;nonnull&quot; one.  I
suspect that it isn't.)

The &quot;deeply embedded devices&quot; scenario was the second one I called out.
It doesn't actually apply to all such devices, but most places where
that policy is used are ROM-based (and have CPU and other resources to
waste on such checks).


&gt;<i> If this philosophy has a religious following, it comes with ceremonies
</I>&gt;<i> that have the same effect on its practitioners as does Russian Roulette.
</I>
Not true.  It's pretty common in operating systems ... where the overhead
of the superfluous testing is actively detrimental.  I've seen benchmarks
showing library performance improved by over 10% on common tasks, just by
getting rid of such crap.  Ditto device drivers and other key system
infrastructure.  It turns out that the icache impact of such code is much
worse than you'd think.  Ditto code density and thus paging rates.  When
six or ten different components are each wasting 10% of their time on such
defensive programming, the result isn't just a 10% overall slowdown.

You're running Linux right now, yes?  That's one place using such policies.

And there are no &quot;ceremonies&quot; ... if someone gets a null pointer exception
it's pretty easily -- and *VERY* quickly -- fixed.  And the developers are
well trained to avoid creating such bugs in the first place.

In contrast, I've seen that on systems which test for NULLs all over the
place ... some fairly rude systematic bugs never get fixed, because of all
those lowlevel checks which ameliorate the fault modes.  And in fact just
trying to fix them is rarely well received, since those &quot;it's always safe
to do stupid crap&quot; assumptions are *everywhere* in the code.
