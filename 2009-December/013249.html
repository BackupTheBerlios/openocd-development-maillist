It did ... letting me focus on the funkier issues I was wanting to
chase, instead of &quot;init&quot; breaking.  :)

I think that should be the longer term fix.  What's the advantage
to that change in &quot;init&quot; semantics?  &quot;Makes things harder to use&quot;
doesn't seem win-like to me!

I don't see that.  With *any* release there's the expectation that it
hasn't broken compatibility with the previous one ... unless there were
all sorts of warning flags.  And the only policy I've ever seen in this
project is that there should be plenty of advance notice for changes
that break compatibility; &quot;a year or so&quot; was the time frame ISTR was
discussed earlier this year.  (And so it's the upcoming release which
drops compatibility with some commands folk were warned away from
starting in autumn of 2008...)

If there's no expectation of compatibility, it might as well be
called a fork and given a new project name.


&gt;<i> If so, 
</I>&gt;<i> then cut 0.4.0 as 1.0, and let's drop the charade that developers have
</I>&gt;<i> freedom to change stuff.  That's what 0.x means to me.
</I>
It's never meant that to me, on any product.  There's always the
constraint to avoid breaking users.  (It's possible that serious
bug fixes will require that.  That doesn't match this change.)

There's still freedom to change stuff.  Just ... not to do so in
ways that prevent dropping the next release into the slot that's
now occupied by the current one, and which isn't giving warnings
about dubious practice.
