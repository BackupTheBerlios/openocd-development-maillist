Well, &quot;one humongous patch&quot; won't get merged, so it's got to get
broken down into logical chunks in any case.  I'd kind of like
to see this at least *start* in the 0.5 series.

What I'm missing right now is seeing a model for how this will
work.  I've started to look at the patches from Simon and Andrew;
they're both too huge to understand at once (thus un-reviewable
and un-mergeable).

Note that the point isn't to have &quot;really small&quot; patches.  It's
to have comprehensible/reviewable patches, usually in a series
of chunks that build on each other.  Reviewers will look at each
one, usually in sequence, and need to have breaks.

And for something substantial like this, it's also customary to
plan on having multiple iterations ... and quite possibly to see
incremental merges.

I'll post some technical followup on another thread.

 
&gt;<i> If so, when I 'git commit', my credentials will appear in the log. How
</I>&gt;<i> can I best prepare the small patches and ensure that Simon is given the
</I>&gt;<i> credit for his own work?
</I>
Read the git documentation more closely ... what I generally do is
&quot;git am&quot; from a patch with &quot;From:&quot; and &quot;Subject:&quot; lines, and only
do &quot;git commit&quot; for stuff I've written myself.  There are environment
variables that &quot;git commit&quot; will use.

So far there's not been a lot of traffic for patches I'm comfortable
merging right from someone's repository.  (I expect that will be
happening someday though!)  So for now, I want to receive patches as
text ... at which point it's easy to edit the text to make sure the
changes get properly credited.
