This is an important point: if you want your ZY1000 to provide an inline
version, then you should be able to do that.

&gt;<i> Similarly the classic minidriver must be able to implement jtag_add_xxx()

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Inline functions may not be used in public APIs, because they prevent

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The statement above is wrong. For a platform with an ABI for shared

</I>&gt;<i> shared library ABI, on an embedded platform you use the minidriver

</I>
Right, for situations like yours, it does makes sense to allow inline
functions.  For shared libraries, however, my statements stand.
And those are public APIs.  Your platform has no public APIs and never
will, because you're statically linking the everything into one
binary... right?  So my statements are fully correct, and your reading
of them was too incorrect. ;)

Anyway, I think that I might have fixed everything that I was annoyed
with in the patches I just pushed.  Take another look at things and tell
me what you think needs to be done now.... :)
