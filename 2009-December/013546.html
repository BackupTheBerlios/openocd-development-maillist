Only if the NULL can be a result of normal run-time operation.  Memory
allocation failures should be expected in normal run-time operations;
even though they are undesirable, the program must always handle them.
In library APIs where it's impossible to determine such pre-conditions,
they must be checked... or we have a buggy library.

If the NULL can derive _only_ from programming error, then the assert()
macro should be used instead.  These can be optimized out with a
configure option (along with blocks of code in #ifndef NDEBUG blocks),
so these can provide reports for programmers without impacting runtime
performance in deployment.

&gt;<i> &gt; Nonetheless, the code is IMHO at least better maintainable and more clear.

</I>
This model falls down in embedded devices and under heavy load with
dynamic memory allocation.  In neither case will it be remotely easy for
the user of the device or application to produce a viable crash report.

If this philosophy has a religious following, it comes with ceremonies
that have the same effect on its practitioners as does Russian Roulette.
