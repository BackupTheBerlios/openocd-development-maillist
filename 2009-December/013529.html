<PRE>Hi Michael, hi all

&gt;<i> There is setedit that uses gdb. I haven't tried the one on windows
</I>
Cool :-). Looks like Borland C++ 3.1, that i have used
some decades ago with DOS 5.0 :-))). Since i use midnight commander
a lot, this is really an option :-).

&gt;&gt;<i> kdbg would be nicer. insight sucks. If someone would come up with
</I>&gt;<i> something that looks like IAR or Raisonnance that'd be neat. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> looking into that but right now I am too busy with my porting of STM8
</I>&gt;<i> to GCC.
</I>
Well, i would be happy with KDbg and OpenOcd.

&gt;<i> IAR could but it is expensive. At work I paid around $6000 for it. It
</I>&gt;<i> costs about $1500 per year for support.
</I>
Yes, i know. I use a lot Lauterbach and PLS. They are in the same
region. Nonetheless, this is a private project so i don't want to
spent too much money in it.

&gt;<i> Raisonnance is a lot cheaper. I don't know about the ARM version, the
</I>&gt;<i> one I bought is for the STM8 for around $1400.
</I>
Far away for private use and i don't think that i really get something
that would be so much better then OpenOcd. The NXP jtag
interface is pretty annoying and i don't think that IAR can do much
more with it (without Traceport) then OpenOcd.

Debugging was once cool with real emulators, with jtag, bdm or whatever,
it always sucks a bit.


Best Regards,



Carsten
