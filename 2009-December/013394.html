Whoops.... that must be a &quot;minor&quot; refactoring think-o.  When I moved the
functionality and added the new helper, I must have forgot to call it.
Sorry. :(

&gt;<i> So I add that missing call, and now I see the various flash

</I>&gt;<i> and not-helpful output, but output.  (This command used to

</I>
The post-processing stuff is problematic, in so far as it's no longer
possible to wrap second-tier commands as it was in the past.  Honestly,
total feature compatibility will be difficult to reinstate, but I am not
sure that anyone uses this feature at present.  I recognized this
problem at some point, but there were bigger things on my radar.  

I have conceive of 'command' module upgrade that would be provide the
same functionality, but I would prefer to see if this is actually a
problem that needs to be solve in the general case.  For now, I think it
might be best to recreate the flash banks wrapper functionality in the C
handler.  Thoughts, before I dive into this?

&gt;<i> But now I can't &quot;flash probe 0&quot; ... why?
</I>
Given the amount of change that's occurred in that module lately, it
would be nice to know when I broke it.  I will try to figure it out from
casual inspection, but I probably need more details on this one.

&gt;<i> ... that's enough debugging for now.  Zach?
</I>
I am in the middle of a new series to add multiple interface support
that is coming along nicely, but I'll pause shortly and look into this
problem further.  Sorry for the noise and confusion.
