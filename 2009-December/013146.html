If I took it over, I would fork and start on a new major revision.
The current version appears to be unmaintainable... which, incidentally,
might be why it needs a new maintainer. ;)

&gt;<i> Are you sure you it's a good idea to start this now?
</I>
Yes, but you are verily confused about my direction.

&gt;<i> To truly tackle this you would have to handle different cases: jim tcl
</I>&gt;<i> in shared library, jim tcl statically linked, jim tcl created by someone
</I>&gt;<i> else than OpenOCD...
</I>
For OpenOCD, it is not nearly as hard as you make it seem:

1) Rename ecosboard.c as openocd_ecos.c
2) Add openocd_common.c, openocd_linux.c, openocd_win32.c, etc.
3) Declare stuff in openocd.h and define them in all files.  Some files
will declare only stubs... others will

This would allow us to get rid of most Win32, eCos, and other
platform-related #if's throughout the tree, perhaps all of them.

However, the original patch from $SUBJECT could still be improved:
that #if block can be moved to openocd.c, which has the effect today as
the plan above would accomplish.  Thus, we can add 'assert(interp)' at
the top of the command_init routine, as both callers pass it in.
