</I>No, IIRC it was when flashing the internal flash on a LM3S6918 - the 
error happened on the last byte, since the length of the last segment 
was not padded to a word boundary.
&gt;<i> I might want to stick in a warning; ISTR that linker scripts

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Yes, however, when flashing readily-downloaded sample binaries this can 
get troublesome.
A warning is OK with me.

&gt;<i> Though ... I suppose that just verifying flash writes would
</I>&gt;<i> catch a number of these problems too.  After all, the main
</I>&gt;<i> constraint is that zero bits can't turn back to ones...
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Sounds good. Another alternative would be to read the current flash 
contents, patch in the byte to be written, and then write it back. That 
way, a single byte at the end of a segment can be written, and nothing 
is accidentally overwritten.

&gt;<i> Semi-related ... how about the generic NOR patch insisting
</I>&gt;<i> that erases only apply to whole sectors?  It's not quite
</I>&gt;<i> the converse of this patch.  This one was perhaps more on
</I>&gt;<i> the side of paranoia.  That one was concern that the code
</I>&gt;<i> was certainly doing something destructive, by clobbering
</I>&gt;<i> data it was told to leave alone.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Allowing erase only on complete sectors is fine with me, because the 
damage potential is large, and I see no direct use case where you would 
specify a partial sector and expect that the whole sector should be erased.

One thing to take care of would be write_image with the erase option: 
the image will probably not competely fill the last sector, but the 
erase should not fail in that case.
