<PRE>Hi everyone,

&lt;Flamewar protection on&gt;

I just glance at the mailing list chatter, so please excuse if my suggestion/comment is completely off the wall/misinformed/completely wrong and please ignore it if that's the case.

I get the impression that you (the developers) are butting your head against the limitations of C. Why don't you finish development to get a stable C version of OpenOCD working and then design an object-orientated C++ architecture with all of the experience and insights that you have gained so far? I'm thinking that the abstraction and encapsulation will do a lot to clean up the code and make the architecture flexible/expandable.

Also, it would be nice if you switched to a human readable scripting language, i.e. Lua :)

&lt;/Flamewar protection on&gt;

Sincerely,
Pieter Conradie
