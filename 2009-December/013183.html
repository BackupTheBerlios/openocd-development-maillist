Considering how many NULL pointer checks are missing after routines that
might return such a value, I am surprised that we do not see more.

I do remember seeing one recently (exactly the scenario I described...),
though I think that bug related to my refactoring efforts.  Still, I
recall it being intractable at first glance, whereas these patches might
have given us a small clue about the problem as part of the output log
that the user provided for us.

In any case, this will point us to the places where we need such tests,
and these bugs are more likely to be exposed in production-line (i.e.
user) environments rather than on developer machines with gigs of RAM.

Your points about the mailing list continue to be valid, regardless.
