I think that'd be a good thing to do.  Wasn't what I was aiming
for in this patch series though.


&gt;<i> Say

</I>
Agreed.  And &quot;architecture level&quot; doesn't fully address the
problem either.  By and large I'd take the version tags off,
even for breakpoints.  Kind of like I've been doing with all
the other ARM symbols that aren't actually tied to some core
or architecture version!

 
&gt;<i> &gt; Tightening up some of the line lengths turned up a curious artifact:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the macros for the Thumb opcodes are all 32 bits wide, not 16 bits.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There's currently no explanation for why it's done that way...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When pushing instruction in the CPU pipeline through scan chain 1 on an 
</I>&gt;<i> ARM9TDMI (or compatible) CPU core, you need to use 32 bits for the 
</I>&gt;<i> instruction field.  If in Thumb mode, the 16-bit Thumb instructions have 
</I>&gt;<i> to be duplicated on both 16-bit nibbles of the 32-bit field.
</I>
So that doubling would only need to be done when pushing a Thumb
opcode through the pipeline ... but here it's done always.  Before
Thumb2, there were only a couple 32-bit instructions.  And since
they were for branches, we wouldn't run them in debug mode.


&gt;<i> From Section B.7 &quot;Determining the core and system state&quot; of &quot;ARM9E-S 
</I>&gt;<i> Core Technical Reference Manual&quot; (DDI0240A.pdf):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> |   Note
</I>&gt;<i> |
</I>&gt;<i> |   Because all Thumb instructions are only 16 bits long,
</I>
Maybe back then they were!  Now it's acknowledged that there
are two models even for those 32-bit branch instructions.
One is to execute in two halves, with IRQ possible between
the halves.  The other is to execute as one opcode.  I'd
guess those original Thumb cores (which got a *LOT* of
mileage!) took the two-halves approach.


&gt;<i> |   			the simplest 
</I>&gt;<i> |   method, when shifting scan chain 1, is to repeat the instruction. For
</I>&gt;<i> |   example, the encoding for BX R0 is 0x4700, so when 0x47004700 shifts
</I>&gt;<i> |   into scan chain 1, the debugger does not have to keep track of the half
</I>&gt;<i> |   of the bus on which the processor expects to read the data.
</I>
So it's an implementation shortcut.  Though ... I'm not sure when
we'd be pushing Thumb opcodes through the pipeline of an ARM9 (or
presumably ARM7 too?) core!  Generally the model seems to be to
keep the core in ARM state except when it's running code.  Only
the Cortex-M cores do otherwise, I think.

Thanks for the info, that sounds likely to be the intent.  It was
that way in the original SVN checkin.  I'm unlikely to check what
Dominic's thesis had to say on this topic.  :)
