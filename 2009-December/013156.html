Mostly.  Without built-in stack traces, we may not be getting good
reports even from casual developers, as they decide it's too much work
to track down a random bug.  If the stack trace makes the bug reporting
process a little bit easier, right there, it's a win for us....  

And this shows how we need to take selection bias when accounting for
the present state of affairs.  We can't assume that the lack of segfault
reports means a lack of segfaults.  It could show unwillingness to track
down odd crashes that users experience only now and again.  

Personally, I won't work very hard to reproduce a random crash, but a
stack trace would give me an potential fast-path to the means of
investigating it immediately.  Some bugs require a set of such traces
before their cause becomes apparent, and I'm am a little surprised we
haven't had more of them with Jim.  I sure could have used this feature
when working on the 'unknown' command handler.  I could have completely
skipped using GDB at all, but I had to break down when I hit some
trouble with recursion.  

The new stack facilities offer the ability to add an algorithm that
spots endless recursion in Jim by looking for a pattern of N repeating
k-frames (where N is fairly big).  Or, it could be used to find a
high-water mark for our stack usage, and simply warn when it exceeds
that by some threshold.  That shows how this code could be used to
improve our deployed runtime resilience, putting aside symbol lookup.

For the relative complexity of its interpreted language, Jim seems to
cause us comparatively little grief as far as bug reports go.  That's
another reason that I see it as daunting to tackle a clean-up; it's
likely to only cause regressions. ;)

It's not high pressure, and I need to implement no-op versions that can
be used by platforms that lack their own implementation.  With such
facilities in place, others can add support for these (presently)
optional APIs at their own leisure.  This will make it easy to phase in
loadable module support later, which -- of course -- will be a
completely optional feature too.
