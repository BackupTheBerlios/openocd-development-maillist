The first thing I tried, by the way, was

	gdb_memory_map enable

but that failed with extreme rudeness.  :(

It happens ... but this is the kind of thing that makes
me certain that we need more than just a couple of weeks
of testing in the RC phase.  Too much has changed for me
to believe there aren't a bunch more problems lurking.

Notice for example what arm720 and arm920 are now doing
when you try to write a coprocessor register.  They're
trying to write it using the *READ* instruction ...


&gt;<i> &gt; So I add that missing call, and now I see the various flash

</I>
Which feature ... &quot;flash banks&quot;?  I use it to see what's
been set up.  There's no other way to get *concise* data.

(I'd think this should not be problematic.  If there's
already an override TCL script registered, don't define
a new one.)

Though I'd actually prefer to see a subset of what the
&quot;flash info&quot; command shows, for each bank:  skip all the
per-block status (most of which is &quot;don't know&quot; until you
check a few things, and the rest of which is repetitive),
but give more detailed info about each bank.
