I provided the minimum in version 2 of the patch.  For improved prose 
I'll defer to those amongst us with better English writing skills.

&gt;<i> Also, NEWS; and surely a few TODO list updates (like that
</I>&gt;<i> mapping table, etc).
</I>
I'll let someone else modify the NEWS.  As to the TODO items: they're 
already commented in the code.  So please just commit v2 as is now and 
let's put incremental improvements on top.  I want other people to get 
involved too!  ;-)

&gt;<i> What's the story on how one would *use* this?  Must target
</I>&gt;<i> code be linked with pay-money-for-software from ARM?  Or
</I>&gt;<i> do other options exist?
</I>
Did you read my patch commit log?

OK let's make it easy (for those who are eager to contribute extra 
documentation... hint hint).

Semihosting crash HOWTO
-----------------------

1) Get &quot;Sourcery G++ Lite 2009q1-161 for ARM EABI&quot; from
   <A HREF="http://www.codesourcery.com/sgpp/lite/arm/portal/release830">http://www.codesourcery.com/sgpp/lite/arm/portal/release830</A>

Maybe there is a newer release now which should work just as well.  I'm 
still using the one above so...

2) Install it (how to install is out of the scope for this HOWTO)

Documentation on proper installation is provided through the above site.

3) Create test code

$ cat &gt; foobar.c &lt;&lt; EOF

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main()
{
	printf(&quot;\n\nHello World!\n\n\n&quot;);
	exit(0);
}
EOF

4) Compile it

$ arm-none-eabi-gcc -T generic-hosted.ld -o foobar.elf foobar.c

For more control on things like heap and stack placement you'll have to 
read the accompanying documentation (or dig in the provided linker 
script).

5) Using OpenOCD, load onto target

|&gt;<i> soft_reset_halt
</I>|&gt;<i> load_image foobar.elf
</I>|&gt;<i> arm7_9 semihosting enable
</I>|&gt;<i> resume 0
</I>
Interaction with the remote application then happens on the console 
where OpenOCD is running.

&gt;<i> It seems to just use SVC, so that means no particular constraints (as 
</I>&gt;<i> would be the case if it required DCC and precluded using libdcc).
</I>
Right.  And documentation on the semihosting interface is publicly 
available (see reference in the code).

&gt;<i> Please start us with a brief &quot;how to...&quot; email, and recap
</I>&gt;<i> who would be interested (and why).  Done well that'd be
</I>&gt;<i> the seeed of the User's Guide coverage.
</I>
Interest is pretty evident when you want to display debugging 
information from code running on a target without a serial port for 
example, or during early board bringup when there is simply no code yet 
to drive the serial port.  This is also pretty handy when writing, say, 
SPI flash programming utilities which are best ran on the target 
directly but with the ability to provide interactive menus and read (or 
write) data files directly from the host.  Etc. Etc...

&gt;<i> Code-wise ... I'd rather see an explicit flag stored in
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;struct arm&quot;, rather than depend on nobody setting
</I>&gt;<i> their own values for the vector catch flag.  Instead of
</I>&gt;<i> that global.  (Resolve before merge please.)
</I>
Not sure that I follow you here.  But like I said above: please merge it 
now and let's improve it later.  This is already plenty functional as is 
and further cleanups should be trivial.

&gt;<i> It'd also make sense to have the &quot;semhosting active&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> status appear in armv4_5_arch_state(); but nothing if
</I>&gt;<i> it's inactive.  Maybe just an optional string at the
</I>&gt;<i> end of the line with CPSR and PC.
</I>
Indeed.  Same argument apply.
