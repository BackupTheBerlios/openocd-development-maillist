That is your choice.  Would you deprive me of mine, given that it can be
done out-of-tree?  However, be careful.  If you would push my out of the
tree, what would prevent me to push for Jim to be moved out of it too,
putting all front-ends on equal footings?  Better be prepared to get
used to installing both libopenocd and openocd-jim....

Unity is better.  It can be done cleanly, so there is no technical
reason to force forks to add major features like this.

</I>
Your analogy is equally flawed, in so far as we'll still have the C
libraries... which will be stronger for having multiple front-ends.

I think you are failing to see the benefits that re-use would bring to
the core OpenOCD libraries.  Multiple languages opens the door to
support that we will not get today, because some users will not want to
use TCL.  With them, the libraries will get polished into shining
beacons for all that want to write JTAG-related applications (betcha').

In any case, the best language upgrade would be Tcl -- either Jim 2.0,
real Tcl/Tk support, or just to support a radically new command syntax.
Any of which require the changes I suggest.  Other languages is really
rather far fetched given existing momentum, but that hardly diminishes
the benefits that allowing them will bring to the existing code.
