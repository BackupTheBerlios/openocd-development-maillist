Great!  Though try to filter out any that aren't going
to be in the &quot;obviously worth fixing&quot; category and are
more in the &quot;debatable style choice&quot; side of things.


&gt;<i> 90% of the warnings reported are things that complain about &quot;code style&quot;

Most of those would be no problem at all to see fixed.

 
&gt;<i> &gt; Note that MISRA is not universally lauded. &#160;As I understand, some of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; its practices are contrary to other widely adopted coding policies.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sure. Some points are a laugh like &quot;a null pointer should not be
</I>&gt;<i> dereferenced&quot;.
</I>
That one touches on interesting system philosophy though.  Should
one guard _every_ pointer access with an &quot;if (ptr == NULL)&quot; check?

I'm personally used to the answer to that being &quot;no&quot;, and being
able to rely on inputs being non-NULL ... unless they're explicitly
stated as allowing NULL.


&gt;<i> Nonetheless, the code is IMHO at least better maintainable and more clear.
</I>
I'm not sure what you mean to imply by that NULL example, but the
two philosophies I'm aware of are:

 - Having largely superfluous NULL checks obfuscates the code and
   makes it less clear.  If anyone wrongly passes a NULL, we get a
   nice fast-fail that's easily tracked down and fixed.  Plus, there
   is a *LOT* of code (and runtime cycles) wasted on such checks.

		versus

 - Omitting such checks risks runtime failure that we can't ever
   resolve once it gets in &quot;the field&quot;.  So checking is better
   even though it slows things down and is largely pointless:  you
   can look at the code and know this failure won't happen.

		and its variant

 - Never use NULL.  Always us a designated NOP object/instance
   with an is_null() predicate.

Note that there are two different models of code maintainance there,
and two models of what &quot;clear&quot; means.
