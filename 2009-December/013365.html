Yes, but that doesn't mean it can't be put on hold for a time. :)
I will be aggressively supportive of keeping a regular release schedule,
though I am glad that you are taking the lead.

That sounds like a long time, so I would rather say it depends on
feedback from the first couple of releases.  If we don't get any bug
reports (hah!), then there is no reason for a long release window.
That said, the last -rc needs at least a week before turning final, so
it could well become a month if we turn out 3 of them.
