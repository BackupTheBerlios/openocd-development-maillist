Last byte?  Sounds like a different issue.  Maybe related; were
you talking to 16-bit wide NOR at the time?  If so, you counldn't
see such problems except with a single byte at the end.  :)

I'm a bit concerned because this behavior looks troublesome, but
it's seemingly been there long enough for things to start depending
on that dubious behavior.  (Hence the &quot;RFC&quot; in $SUBJECT!)

 
&gt;<i> If this patch re-introduces that behaviour, I ask not to apply it - it 
</I>&gt;<i> would make writing programs with odd-sized data segments a pain.
</I>
I might want to stick in a warning; ISTR that linker scripts
can be taught not to create such segments, and thus to avoid
such behaviors (and warnings). 

Though ... I suppose that just verifying flash writes would
catch a number of these problems too.  After all, the main
constraint is that zero bits can't turn back to ones...


Semi-related ... how about the generic NOR patch insisting
that erases only apply to whole sectors?  It's not quite
the converse of this patch.  This one was perhaps more on
the side of paranoia.  That one was concern that the code
was certainly doing something destructive, by clobbering
data it was told to leave alone.
