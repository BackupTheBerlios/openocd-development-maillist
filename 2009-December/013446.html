I second this.  There was a nice discussion about how the developers of
OpenOCD tend to be more comfortable in C because of the embedded work they
do.  In addition, OpenOCD is built to run on some embedded systems as well
as normal desktops.  In the end, the overhead might be a bit much to
actually push to something like C++.

At the same time, I completely agree with the sentiment.  There has also
been a lot of discussion about function stubs and overriding functions that
lead us down the road of OO programming.  OpenOCD still does that, but in a
C sort of way.  You don't need C++ :).

By the way, you should look at the recent discussion by Zach and some others
about abstracting commands so that they aren't specific to a language like
TCL.  It may be sometime in the future OpenOCD can be configured with TCL
and LUA just for fun.
