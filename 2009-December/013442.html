Assuming they all get done, they'd absolutely need to be
spread out over enough time to consider each proposal,
and to address that feedback.

Yeah, every time I see that I scratch my head and say &quot;WTF&quot;.
It should be derived from &quot;real&quot; scan chain operations.

Yoicks ... that kind of interaction is sick:  not being
able to talk to one TAP, because another one is sniffing
the JTAG state transitions!

Maybe that's why there seems to have been a slowdown in
the IEEE 1149.7 work ... it was originally using a &quot;zero
byte scan&quot; to kick in new functionality, but I saw some
alternate noise about not using TCK more recently.


&gt;<i> What I would like to see pushed before 0.4 are sweeping
</I>&gt;<i> changes with low risk profile, so as to make branches
</I>&gt;<i> easier to maintain.
</I>
Not too many more such changes though, I hope.  :)

I think all the ones we planned on are now finished
(many from Zach) and I think the tree is much-improved
in consequence.
