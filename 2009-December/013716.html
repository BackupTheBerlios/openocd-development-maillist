Writing ones to it, as the current code does, should have the
same &quot;no change&quot; effect ... hence my thought about verification.

Consider what happens if you write to some flash that's not
been erased beforehand.  In most cases, you lose ... 

 
&gt;<i> &gt; Semi-related ... how about the generic NOR patch insisting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that erases only apply to whole sectors?  It's not quite
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the converse of this patch.  This one was perhaps more on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the side of paranoia.  That one was concern that the code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was certainly doing something destructive, by clobbering
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; data it was told to leave alone.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> Allowing erase only on complete sectors is fine with me, because the 
</I>&gt;<i> damage potential is large, and I see no direct use case where you would 
</I>&gt;<i> specify a partial sector and expect that the whole sector should be erased.
</I>
My thought exactly.  I'll commit that change as-is then...

 
&gt;<i> One thing to take care of would be write_image with the erase option: 
</I>&gt;<i> the image will probably not competely fill the last sector, but the 
</I>&gt;<i> erase should not fail in that case.
</I>
... and expect some followup bugfixes.  That one, for example,
certainly deserves at least a WARNING whenever it kicks in...
