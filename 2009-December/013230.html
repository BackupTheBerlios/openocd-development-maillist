Let me emphasize my point above: remove the #include from jtag.h.
Do not expose it outside the JTAG layer.  If it is a public API too,
then you must rename the inline version and call it from a new wrapper
function in jtag/core.c.  You are exposing all of the minidriver to the
entire system, and that's unacceptable.

If this hurts performance, then please show us the numbers here first.
Even then, this needs to be done in a way that maintains encapsulation.

&gt;<i> I'm not quite sure how you define a layer violation here. How can I tell
</I>&gt;<i> that there is a violation happening?
</I>
jtag.h &gt;&gt;&gt; public APIs for use by external applications

minidriver.h &gt;&gt;&gt; internal APIs.  These drivers will _always_ be built-in
to the tree (for performance reasons). Thus, their interfaces should
__never__ be exposed to users through the public JTAG API.

minidummy/jtag_interface.h &gt;&gt;&gt; implementation APIs are even more
internal, yet your patch will make these available in the public API!!

No one should be adding new internals into public headers.  If this
means we need to create a slew of &quot;&lt;module&gt;_imp.h&quot; files to share bits
of the internal &quot;imp&quot;lementation, then so be it.  It's worth it, if it
means that we can stop expose our internals.  Nevertheless, you have to
stop and really consider the consequences of stick stuff in headers!
Who will see it?  Should they?! ;)   Create a new function to wrap the
inline call if needed, but stop sticking stuff in the wrong place!!

I can make our libraries usable for 0.4.0, though the APIs will not be
stable for some time yet.  Still, it opens the door to writing external
applications; that option is closed today, and we are hurting the code
by delaying.  We'll never find out the problems until we start writing
applications that use the code -- such as a test suite.

Given these hard constraints, I recommend taking another stab at the
patch and finding a way around this.  To be honest, this might reflect
fundamental design flaws with the minidriver, such that it can only be
fixed after some rather drastic re-writing of the code.  If the code
relies this heavily on these optimizations, it's broken by design.

Cheers,
