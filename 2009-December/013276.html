And they should now, after my patches.  I want to see yours again,
updated against the current master.  :)

For your platform, you can forget about the ABI.  For shared libraries,
it is important....  However, I agree that &quot;commitment&quot; to the ABI
should not be something to consider until 1.0 (or even 2.0...).

Striving to create a stable ABI, however, will improve the code, and
that is the real goal here.  It's about architectural correctness, and
inline functions are _not_ necessary for good performance.  I feel very
confident that your requirement for them could be eliminated by using
better algorithms in the JTAG layer, and you would still see better
performance than you get today.

Sure, that entails far more work, but the price to get correctness in
design is higher than that required to reach correctness in function.
