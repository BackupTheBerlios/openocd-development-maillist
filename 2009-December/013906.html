</I>You would have to look at the run_algorithm code in the CFI driver and
match that against the datasheet for the flash. Remote debugging this
might get difficult.

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Hm. From a quick look, I did not see anything strange in the 39VF6401B
datasheet that would explain the differences.

Unfortunately, the biggest SST flash I have here in my collection is the
39VF3201, so this is no help for you.


&gt;<i> kind of trouble as some of the other people I read about are having? 
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  I do not know what kind of trouble you are talking about - I can't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i> remember any unresolved CFI/non-CFI flash problems related to command
</I>&gt;<i> sets on this list in the lasts few months. Do you have a pointer to such
</I>&gt;<i> a discussion?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ohh maybe I got it wrong. I was referring to posts similar to this:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://forum.sparkfun.com/viewtopic.php?t=4272">http://forum.sparkfun.com/viewtopic.php?t=4272</A>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Hm - are you serious?
You use a post on some obscure web forum, more than 3 years out of date,
as reference?
Even if a current problem is described there, how should the OpenOCD
developers know about it?

Support for AMD/Spansion CFI flash has been in OpenOCD for quite some
time, and works great - otherwise, you would not be able to program the
39VF3201, either.

I just pulled current openocd-git and plugged an EON EN29LV640L into my
development board (I have sockets for those TSOP48 flashs - too bad
Yamaichi stopped making them when ROHS came up):

JTAG tap: ipx42x.cpu tap/device found: 0x19277013 (mfg: 0x009, part:
0x9277, ver: 0x1)
target state: halted
target halted in ARM state due to debug-request, current mode: Supervisor
cpsr: 0x000000d3 pc: 0x00000000
MMU: disabled, D-Cache: disabled, I-Cache: disabled
(processor reset)
XSCALE_CTRL (/32): 0x000000F8
Flash Manufacturer/Device: 0x007f 0x227e
configuration specifies 0x200000 size, but a 0x800000 size flash was found
flash 'cfi' found at 0x50000000
&gt;<i> uboot
</I>protect: cfi primary command set 2 unsupported
cleared protection for sectors 0 through 10 on flash bank 0
auto erase enabled
wrote 262144 bytes from file /tftpboot/actux1/u-boot.bin in 10.847293s
(23.600 kb/s)

This is definitely an AMD (02) commandset flash.

(BTW: that write speed looks great - I was used to get around 12KB/s
using my parport adapter)

SST 39VF3201 works fine on my board, too, but I don't have a 39VF6401 to
test.
