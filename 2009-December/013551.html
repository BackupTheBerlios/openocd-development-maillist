&gt;<i> Debugging was once cool with real emulators, with jtag, bdm or whatever,

</I>I dislike the emulators. At work I have some projects with a Fujitsu 
processor and when I debug I need the $15k emulator
to connect to the board thru a $200 socket. I can't debug a production 
ready board.
Emulators give you more debugging power but the fact that you need a pod 
and expensive socket makes it an unwanted choice.

Nexus would be a good option on ARM or AVR32 if it didn't use so many pins.

The jtag debugging can be better if you have functions in RAM. With IAR 
you get 1 breakpoint, 1 being used by IAR.
I managed to get 2 but that was with messing up with the way IAR works out.

With Eclipse I like better the debuging on the AT32UC3C0512 since I have 
more hardware breakpoints than on the ARM and their gdb interface is 
quicker than OpenOCD.
I bought a JTAGICE mkII, Arrow has a sale right now for $150. Debugging 
is real nice and it works very well with Eclipse.
The nice thing about JTAGICE is that it works well on Linux as well as 
Windows with full support from Atmel. It would be nice if they'd release 
the code though. It would
have been quicker for me to get it work on Mandriva 2010.0. Atmel 
supports Linux but not Mandriva.

I think that once OpenOCD is optimized it should work just as nice on 
the ARM (except for the lack of breakpoints)
