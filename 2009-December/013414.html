<PRE>Hi all,

The following list describes the things that might still be accomplished
before the 0.4.0-rc cycle starts.  These features are all &quot;mostly done&quot;
in my tree; they work fine for me in limited testing.  They should all
be safe incremental steps to take.

- generic driver/instance helper module
  - struct object: root of driver-instantiated objects
  - struct driver: root of driver objects (and is-a object itself)
  - Allows adding 'struct module' to provide loadable drivers someday.
- flash driver/instance unification
  - NOR tree is converted to use 'object' and 'driver' model.
    - flash_banks are 'object's of flash_driver device 'driver's
  - NAND tree can be converted similarly (when done with other patches).
- multiple JTAG interface API support (internal to the JTAG module only)
  - adds jtag_device (object) to instantiate jtag_interface (driver)
  - converts internal APIs: jtag_interface, driver commands, bitbang
  - converts drivers to use new APIs, with dummy support many instances
  - moves some global variables into structures

So far, the JTAG conversion has been completely internal to that module,
so it may not be desirable to introduce this support in 0.4.0 without
&quot;finishing&quot; the work.  Specifically, support must be added at all levels
of the system; many of the public JTAG APIs must be updated so callers
pass the required jtag_device structure.  This process of associating
all of the other parts of the system with a specific interface will take
a larger concerted effort, and it may be too late to get this done.
Even worse, we must integrate this somehow with the current commands. :/

Today, the patches allow updating the internal JTAG APIs to support
multiple interfaces and allow drivers to encapsulate their own state.
Indeed, I have updated the 'dummy' driver to show how multiple device
instances can be supported in one driver with the new interface APIs.
When the high-level APIs switch away from using a global device pointer,
that driver should just work as expected.  Others maintainers should
find it easy to update their own drivers to add this support, even
though this requires removing all post-configuration global variables.

Mirrored in my 'object', 'mem', and 'jtag' branches on repo.or.cz:

While I am going to continue looking at the JTAG layer, I believe that
this current work would be relatively safe to push.  It might be best to
do this integration in stages so each phase gets good testing, but what
do others think about these changes and overall strategy?

Cheers,
