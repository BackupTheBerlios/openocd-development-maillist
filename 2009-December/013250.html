That was my point.  Fork OpenOCD 2.0 and warn it's not compatible.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If so, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then cut 0.4.0 as 1.0, and let's drop the charade that developers have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; freedom to change stuff.  That's what 0.x means to me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's never meant that to me, on any product.  There's always the
</I>&gt;<i> constraint to avoid breaking users.  (It's possible that serious
</I>&gt;<i> bug fixes will require that.  That doesn't match this change.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's still freedom to change stuff.  Just ... not to do so in
</I>&gt;<i> ways that prevent dropping the next release into the slot that's
</I>&gt;<i> now occupied by the current one, and which isn't giving warnings
</I>&gt;<i> about dubious practice.
</I>
The problem with this is that it assumes the status quo is not itself
one big design bug.  Still, I will be happy to maintain the present
feature set, as this strips all motivation to improve it further.

It does, however, motivate me to continue isolating the existing TCL
language support completely, so it can be replaced with a new language.
Deprecation of the old language can be done wholesale, once the new one
is in place and working.  They can coexist without breaking each other,
and it gives the freedom that I want to have without having to fork.

This is the high road... in more ways than one.
