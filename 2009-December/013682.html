I may have overlooked such blatantly bad advice.

My point was that since NULL is a standard return
value from malloc(), it needs to be checked.   It's
not a case of how a routine should behave given an
out-of-spec input value ... it's a case of a very
clearly defined function output.

I referenced that in my message.  You weren't representing
that discussion accurately ... it's about overcommitting
virtual memory, which can in a sense retroactively make a
pointer from malloc() point to memory that's not present.


&gt;<i> I have just checked that out and this is NOT TRUE
</I>&gt;<i> on my linux machine with Fedora Core 11.
</I>
That failure mode is:  alloc some memory, get back pointer
to address space, and then at some later point you try
writing to that memory.  But since the system was using
lazy allocation, at that &quot;later point&quot; there may not be
any swapspace to page that memory into ... so what you
get is a kind of deferred error, if the system is under
very high load.


&gt;<i> &gt; For the record, I've never heard of *ANY* runtime environment where a

</I>&gt;<i> Well.. yesterday people said that right here on the list.
</I>
Sometimes people don't know what they're talking about.
The OOM killer situation is not a malloc() failure.
It's about virtual memory overcommit.
