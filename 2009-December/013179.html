</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; And make sure the &quot;usage&quot; is all strict BNF.  I see angle brackets &quot;&lt;...&gt;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and have no idea what's meant; I've seen both:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  - one-or-the-other ... BNF writes as &quot;( ... | ... )&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  - none-or-one-of ... BNF writes as &quot;[ ... | ... ]&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and so on.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The use of angle brackets intends to distinguish parameter names from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; literal arguments.  Thus [&lt;foo&gt;]  means an optional thing which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; semantically will be used as a &quot;foo&quot;, whereas [foo|bar] means you can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; optionally provide the 'foo' or 'bar' options (literally).  If the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; parameter is required, I used (foo|bar) or &lt;foo|bar&gt; depending on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whether the parameter should be literal or figurative, respectively.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've seen it used in places where it's optional ... e.g. the typical
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;if no  parameter, just dump current state&quot; stuff.
</I>
Okay, but how could you then distinguish constant and variable tokens?

&gt;<i> &gt; By the end of my work, I intended for the usage follow these rules, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it was a long process and I did not have them formulated this clearly.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The use of angle brackets may be non-standard for BNF, but it was based
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on the practices for usage information in most command line utilities.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Command line utility docs I've seen rely on fonts to distinguish
</I>&gt;<i> stuff like that ... '&lt;' and '&gt;' and '|' are shell metacharacters!
</I>
What about using them for notational purposes as I suggested, then
parsing them and displaying proper fonts if possible.  Of course, that
would mean escaping them if you needed them literally, but these tokens
should be _highly_ unlikely to show up as literal command arguments.
I'd almost say &quot;never&quot;, but I am feeling wise enough today to avoid
making such laughable claims.

&gt;<i> &gt; For now, I think it would be helpful for us to add a section to the new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; command API documentation to record the desired rules.  That should give
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the standard for writing and registering command handlers in OpenOCD.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> doc/manual/style.txt says:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    - Use BNF style regular expressions to define parameters:
</I>&gt;<i>      brackets around zero-or-one choices, parentheses around
</I>&gt;<i>      exactly-one choices.
</I>
I guess this requires more detail (and suggests that I should remember
to re-read our style guide on occasion).  Can we have Extended BNF? ;)
 
&gt;<i> &gt; Would you mind taking a stab at this documentation task?  It might also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; give you a chance to touch up that API information (or remark about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible omissions).  As the author of both the code and the docs, it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; likely that I have missed something therein that you will spot when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; making new changes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, I know *that* phenomonon well.  IN the same vein, one wants
</I>&gt;<i> people really *new* to things as reviewers/testers ... everyone
</I>&gt;<i> else has applied blinders they don't even know about.
</I>
The fresh perspective at the point of first working on a project can
never be recovered after gaining some experience.  Although, I suppose
rotating teams of development would help this.  If someone goes away
from an active project for a year, things should have changed enough to
cause them to induce a similar state again by the time they return. ;)

Everyone needs to use this logic to get themselves a paid 1 month
sabbatical every year: you need keep yourself from &quot;going native&quot; with
your projects. :)
