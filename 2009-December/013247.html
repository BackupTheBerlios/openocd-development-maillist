Well, I think we agreed that we want to eliminate 'mode' altogether.

I think you are using &quot;exceptional&quot; semantics, but it was my intention
to preserve compatibility.  For &quot;normal&quot; use cases, I think it continues
to function as before.  But that's no excuse, just rationalization. ;)
For now, we could make the init's mode=COMMAND_ANY.  That should be a
temporary fix that solves your regression, though the other 'init'
commands may need similar treatment.

As far as backwards-compatibility, I have started thinking about cutting
1.0 for the sake of dropping it.  If we _care_ about backwards
compatibility, then we are already treating the code like the 1.0 branch
and the 0.x name is misleading and detrimental to our image.  If so,
then cut 0.4.0 as 1.0, and let's drop the charade that developers have
freedom to change stuff.  That's what 0.x means to me.
