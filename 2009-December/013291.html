It probably does.  We maintain both a Linux and Windows build internally 
and I didn't get any complaint yet.

It might even just work, at least under Cygwin.

The way to make it more portable is to stick to stdio calls.  Problem 
with that is that fopen() and friends are using FILE* pointers which 
can't be passed directly (think of 64-bit hosts).  So a mapping table 
would have to be maintained, etc.  That might be the way to go anyway 
for added security, but I was not that motivated, at least for a first 
shot at it.  And this code as is fulfills my need already.

&gt;<i> Some docs to openocd.texi would be great.
</I>
It sure would.  ;-)
