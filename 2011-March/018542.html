<PRE>HI all,
here are patches that correct endianess treatment for MIPS-M14Kc Big
Endian targets, as it has been discussed lately here :
<A HREF="http://www.mail-archive.com/openocd-development@lists.berlios.de/msg15770.html,">http://www.mail-archive.com/openocd-development@lists.berlios.de/msg15770.html,</A>
here : <A HREF="http://www.mail-archive.com/openocd-development@lists.berlios.de/msg15769.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/openocd-development@lists.berlios.de/msg15769.html</A>
or here : <A HREF="http://www.mail-archive.com/openocd-development@lists.berlios.de/msg15815.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/openocd-development@lists.berlios.de/msg15815.html</A>
or on some other similar topics.

First patch corrects endianess, but this *might break* behaviour for
targets which do not have little endian TAP. I do am not sure that
targets like this exists, because all miniprograms (ROM monitors) are
written in LE and anyway at the current implementation when you go to
bulk access you will get bytes switched. I added this logic to simple
read and write.

Second patch corrects meaningless while (1) loop in
wait_for_pracc_rw() and also adds some checking that PrAcc is &quot;1&quot;
before FASTDATA access. Since all of this has not been done before, I
am very suprised that it works at all in the current state. EJTAG
specification is explicit on this (chapter 6.5.6 Fastdata Register
(TAP Instruction FASTDATA)) :

As noted above, two conditions must be true for the Fastdata access to
succeed. These are:
&#8226; PrAcc must be 1, i.e., there must be a pending processor access.
&#8226; The Fastdata operation must use a valid Fastdata area address in the
dmseg segment (0xF..F20.0000 to
0xF..F20.000F).

I guess we have been falling to the case that PrAcc was &quot;1&quot; by chance,
maybe because of obscure jtag_add_clocks(5) which I removed.

One thing I am not quite sure about, but is purely empiric, is
re-sending FASTDATA instruction to TAP before each FASTDATA acces.
Since this is done in a loop, this can potentially slow down the
communication. But not putting this instruction makes bulk write fail
systematically with error : &quot;miniprogram did not return to start&quot;.
Again, this is M14Kc, and it seems to be working on M4k. Anyway, if
both versions work on 4K that I think that we can use the changes I
commited.

It would be a great thing if somebody who has M4K board (Andy, Spencer
?) could test these changed before they are commited, so that we can
assure that there is no regression.

Best regards,
Drasko
