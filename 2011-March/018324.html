Unfortunately SWD support is not quite available in openocd yet,
although it is being worked on (by others, not myself - I've got no
claim to fame here). If you check the archives you'll see quite a bit
of discussion on SWD recently, including a report from Tomek from a
couple of days ago that he's just got a connection with SWD using
urjtag rather than openocd, using code he's writing, which will be
brought over to openocd more than likely once finished.

As far as adding hardware to a board, this is pretty straightforward.
Easiest solution is to use a FT2232 / FT2232H and pick a common layout
using it as a jtag programmer, and just put it on the same board. If
you want full compatability you should be able to wire it up to handle
both SWD and jtag (if you've got jtag pins), that way it'll work right
now as jtag, and hopefully as SWD in future. I've done this in the
past using the schematic for the luminary/ti ICDI which has hardware
support for both jtag swd, although Tomek used kt-link, so you could
try copying the ft2232h pinout from that if you want the best chance
of compatibility. The ti/luminary one at least has full schematics,
just grab the user manual pdf for DK-LM3S9B96-UM-04 and it has the
icdi schematics on the last two pages of schematics (google gives the
link).
