Hello Michael,

Michael Fischer:
&gt;<i> out,
</I>
This function sets TMS and TDI and performs a TCK tick.
If tdo_req is non-zero, TDO is sampled and its value put to read back buffer.

&gt;<i> flush,
</I>
Flushes buffer of the driver.

&gt;<i> sleep,
</I>
Enqueues a delay, see JTAG_SLEEP command of the jtag queue.

&gt;<i> in_rdy,
</I>
Indicates that there is available data in drivers read back buffer
which shall be fetched by the bitq layer as soon as possible (i.e. immediately),
so that buffer does not overflow.

&gt;<i> in
</I>
Returns single bit from drivers read back buffer.

&gt;<i> Please can you explain the functionality. I do not understand why
</I>&gt;<i> tdo_req is needed here.
</I>
The low level does capture value of TDO only when upper layer needs it,
this improves performance, saving turnarounds - buffer for captured data in hw
need not to be read that often.
Quite often more data is shifted out than captured back.

&gt;<i> What I could imagine is, that if the bitq want to output 42 bits, the
</I>&gt;<i> out function will be called 42 times. If the hw functionality of the driver
</I>&gt;<i> can not handle the 42 bits, e.g can only handle 16 bits, it will send
</I>&gt;<i> out the first 16 bit chunk if it reached the 16 bit count. After this
</I>&gt;<i> it could inform the upper layer with in_rdy, that new data are available
</I>&gt;<i> to read. Is this the correct handling? The upper layer can now read the
</I>&gt;<i> tdo data, by calling the in function 16 times.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the upper layer want to flush the data, before the end of the hw buffer
</I>&gt;<i> is reached, it called the flush function of the hw driver.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is this the way how the bitq is working?
</I>
You have understood it completely right.

In fact bitq.c is on the same (or similar) level as bitbang.c
it is just the later one is for interfaces with immediate read back response.

The drawback of this design of &quot;master driver&quot; is that there is a function call for every single bit shifted
in/out. In theory, this decreases performance, but I have practically proved that
this overhead is insignificant on a common PC (tested with presto).
This might be an issue for embedded OpenOCD, however, there is still possibility to
implement heavy weight driver or even a hw jtag queue as Oyvind proposed before.

I think the main advantage is what you pointed out - the there is a *single*
source doing the critical jtag processing, no need to repeat it over and over in every driver,
making it easier to do changes to jtag layer without necessity to test every single driver after that.

Any comments or improvements to bitq.c are welcome.

Best regards,

   Pavel
