<PRE>Pavel -- thanks for the detailed reply.  I'm writing this
from home so I don't have exact details.

The parallel-port driver presently in use is gportio.sys
or something like that, and it's very slow.  Yes, this is
on Windows (sorry!)

I have seen USB response times (complete IN/OUT
transaction) on the order of 150 to 200 microseconds,
but I completely agree -- queued operation will be
absolutely necessary for speed.  I'm presuming that
the JTAG-specific FTDI library does that. (It does ask
for a clock divisor to set JTAG clock rate...)

My concern with using oOCD &quot;out of the box&quot; is that
I don't (currently) have a firm description of the scan
chain itself -- that is hard-wired into our code.  It's not
pure ARC or ARM, though it's pretty close.  This isn't
off-the-shelf hardware I'm dealing with -- rather, chips
that we've designed.

No BSDL files that I've seen so far, though I may be able
to weasel that info (or the equivalent) from the chip designers.
Matter of fact, the code that I'm trying to hack has been
written and maintained by the chip designers.

Speaking of ARC -- has anyone successfully applied
openOCD to ARC (ARC700) cores?
