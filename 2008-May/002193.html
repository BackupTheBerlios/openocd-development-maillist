<PRE>Hi List,

I tried to follow ARM's example. Extract :


ARM7TDMI Technical Reference Manual &gt; B.18.1. Breakpoint and watchpoint coupling example

<A HREF="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0210c/apbs18s01.html">http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0210c/apbs18s01.html</A>


The CHAINOUT output of watchpoint register 1 provides the CHAIN input to Watchpoint 0. This CHAIN input enables you to specify complicated configurations of breakpoints and watchpoints.

Note : There is no CHAIN input to Watchpoint 1 and no CHAIN output from Watchpoint 0.

Consider, for example, the request by a debugger to breakpoint on the instruction at location YYY when running process XXX in a multi-process system. If the current process ID is stored in memory, you can implement the above function with a watchpoint and breakpoint chained together. The watchpoint address points to a known memory location containing the current process ID. The watchpoint data points to the required process ID. The ENABLE bit is cleared.

The address comparator output of the watchpoint is used to drive the write enable for the CHAINOUT latch. The input to the latch is the output of the data comparator from the same watchpoint. The output of the latch drives the CHAIN input of the breakpoint comparator. The address YYY is stored in the breakpoint register and when the CHAIN input is asserted, the breakpoint address matches and the breakpoint triggers correctly.


After experimentation, it looks like the CHAINOUT signal of WP1 does not give the desired signal to WP0. I'm stumped as to why this is not working. Any suggestions?

Comments on OpenOCD: A nice advanced feature would be to set complex watchpoints, i.e. specify WP0 and WP1 and which flags, e.g. (CHAIN, nOPC, ENABLE) should be set. At the moment one can not specify which watchpoint should be set, as this &quot;complexity&quot; is abstracted from the user with a linked list.

Best regards,
Pieter Conradie

Subject: [Openocd-development] Chaining watchpoints? Tried by hacking OpenOCD, but it does not work

Hi List,

I am unable to chain watchpoints, i.e. halt the CPU when a value A is written to address B and then if value C is written to address D.

Side Note: this is usually used to halt the CPU when a specific task is executing a piece of code in a multi-tasking kernel. It is accomplished by configuring Watchpoint 1 with the address in memory of the Process ID and the value of the Process we wish to halt. Watchpoint 0 is then configured with the address of the code that we wish to break on and chained to WP1.

In arm7_9_common.c, arm7_9_set_watchpoint(), I hacked the function to set  Watchpoint 0 with:

Line 362 : embeddedice_set_reg(&amp;arm7_9-&gt;eice_cache-&gt;reg_list[EICE_W0_CONTROL_MASK], 0xff &amp; ~EICE_W_CTRL_CHAIN &amp; ~EICE_W_CTRL_nOPC &amp; ~rw_mask);
Line 363 : embeddedice_set_reg(&amp;arm7_9-&gt;eice_cache-&gt;reg_list[EICE_W0_CONTROL_VALUE], EICE_W_CTRL_ENABLE | EICE_W_CTRL_CHAIN | EICE_W_CTRL_nOPC | (watchpoint-&gt;rw &amp; 1));

Watchpoint 1 is set with:

Line 376 : embeddedice_set_reg(&amp;arm7_9-&gt;eice_cache-&gt;reg_list[EICE_W1_CONTROL_MASK], 0xff &amp; ~EICE_W_CTRL_nOPC &amp; ~rw_mask);
Line 377 : embeddedice_set_reg(&amp;arm7_9-&gt;eice_cache-&gt;reg_list[EICE_W1_CONTROL_VALUE], EICE_W_CTRL_nOPC | (watchpoint-&gt;rw &amp; 1));

Note that the CHAIN bit is set for WP0 and that the ENABLE bit is not set for WP1. The breakpoint is supposed to trigger for WP0 when the CHAIN bit is set by WP1. WP1 should not trigger a breakpoint.

This does not work, because a breakpoint is never triggered when the target is resumed. Has anyone tried chaining watchpoints? Any hints/help?

Thanks in advance,

Pieter Conradie
