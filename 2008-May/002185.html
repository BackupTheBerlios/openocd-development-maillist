<PRE>typo has been fixed
The default mask is 0xffffffff  - this means that the data value is ignored.


The best place to look at how these registers are programmed is the arm TRM

FYI,

 

The mask should be set to 0x0000000 when trying to halt the CPU when a
specific value is written, e.g. 

 

wp 0x00200098 4 w 0xaabbccdd 0x00000000

 

Best regards,

Subject: Setting a watchpoint to break when writing a specific value to a
specific address

 

Hi List,

 

The target I am trying to debug is an Atmel AT91SAM7S256 (arm7tdmi core).
The OpenOCD revision is 657. The syntax for setting a watch point is:

 

wp    set watchpoint &lt;address&gt; &lt;length&gt; &lt;r/w/a&gt; [value] [mask]

 

I want OpenOCD to only break when a specific value (0xaabbccdd) is written
to a specific address (0x00200098). I used the following command:

 

wp 0x00200098 4 w 0xaabbccdd

 

By querying the watchpoints (using &quot;wp&quot;) the following is reported (note
that the word &quot;mask&quot; is used twice):

 

address: 0x00200098, mask: 0x00000004, r/w/a: 1, value: 0xaabbccdd, mask:
0xffffffff

 

The problem is that OpenOCD breaks when ANY value is written to the
specified address. Am I missing something?

 

Thanks for your time!

 

Best regards,

Pieter Conradie

 

P.S. I am trying to find the cause of a nasty Prefetch Abort because of a
nested interrupt handler and the only way is using this feature.
