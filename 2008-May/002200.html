<PRE>Hello Michael,

Michael Fischer napsal(a):
&gt;<i> This can be a problem to use the bitq for other hw driver. If I want to use
</I>&gt;<i> it with jlink e.g., I will get a problem. The jlink had a function where I can send
</I>&gt;<i> TDI and TMS data and will get back TDO data. The send buffer had a size of 16384 bits,
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> the best is to fill this buffer before we start the USB transfer. If the
</I>&gt;<i> upper layer request NO TDO data, I must flush the buffer. Or I can create a extra list
</I>&gt;<i> in the lower layer to handle the data which should not send back to the
</I>&gt;<i> upper list.
</I>&gt;<i> Is this a good idea?
</I>
This might be the way to go. It is generally a bad idea to force low level driver to read
TDO in every single tick, this may have performance impact. If the hw reads TDO in every tick,
either the low level driver shall do the job of throwing away unnecessary bits,
or bitq.c might be modified to include a mode for doing this.
The second approach might be more efficient (but not necessarily).

&gt;<i> The idea was to fill up the send buffer up to the max value, here 16384
</I>&gt;<i> before sending the data. Or send if I get a flush command from the upper layer.
</I>
Sure.

&gt;<i> Some question to the RESET command too. Will the upper layer send a flush
</I>&gt;<i> command before a RESET, or must the lower layer flush all data if receive a RESET?
</I>
No it won't. The bitq layer does not deduce whether reset is synchronous or
asynchronous with the data, the lower layer has to flush its buffers if needed.
However, in case of USB devices the reset command is put into the same queue as
TDI/TMS data, hence no need to flush buffer before reset!

&gt;<i> If I take a look in bitq, I found in the bitq_execute_queue function the
</I>&gt;<i> JTAG_RESET case. Here the &quot;in&quot; function is called after the reset, make this
</I>&gt;<i> sense? I think after a RESET there will be no data available.
</I>
Yes, it really *does* make sense. Calling reset e.g. adds reset command to a buffer,
which might fill it up, which in turn causes low level driver to flush the buffer,
so TDO requests already in the queue would generate read back data.
The rule is: in_rdy shall be checked after *every* output operation,
even reset is an output operation.

Note: e.g. PRESTO itself does not distinguish between reset and tms, these are just signals
driven by commands in a single queue. So reset is virtually equivalent to outputting
data for the low level driver and presto (its just a bit different command).

Best regards,
   Pavel
