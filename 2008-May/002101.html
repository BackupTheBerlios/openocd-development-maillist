Hi All,

of course, on the other hand it is quiet disputable, to where the &quot;open world&quot; shall span
to make this GPL compatible, I mean the design of the device and it's firmware is closed.
But this would is an extreme point of view on this, even the PC OpenOCD often runs is typically a closed design.

Actually my personal standpoint is a bit different:
usage of proprietary stuff is fine with me as long as it is an *option* and removing it
does not limit the functionality and usability of the software itself, i.e. there is always
a choice of free (as freedom) JTAG interface.

So even if there was no other option but to use a DLL, this might not be a serious problem,
as long as the DLL is *optional* but *not required* for proper operation of anything else but
communication with that particular hw.
I think this is technically ok, but probably not in the terms of licensing.
I believe that GPL strictly says &quot;no&quot; - it does not distinguish between such &quot;optional&quot;
(in terms not needed for proper functionality at all or there is a free alternative) and &quot;required&quot;.
Or does it? I don't speak &quot;lawyerish&quot;.
The only way is a controlled interface which we do not have.

More notes: PRESTO is also closed hw, but we (ASIX) decided to provide open driver for OpenOCD, as suggested by Dominic.
In my personal opinion, trying to keep closed something what can be easily reverse engineered
or there is no real reason for not opening it is pretty foolish, but some manufacturers do this anyway.
Situation with PRESTO is a lot of different in that the driver was contributed by us as manufacturers if the hw.
It is fine if users of proprietary hw try to make it work with OpenOCD, but it is true that the manufacturer
is granted and advantage without any effort, which is not fair.
Still hw design of PRESTO remains closed and it is commercially sold - as are e.g. graphic cards or hard drives.

Best regards,

   Pavel
