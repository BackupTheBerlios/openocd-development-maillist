<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  I think we want not support the J-Link because
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  it is close software and hardware.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If one follows that argument, then linux boxes shouldn't support ati
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> video cards or broadcom network cards either, IMHO.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm all for adding support for this, and anything else that isn't going
</I>&gt;<i> to end up with someone in court answering for the decision.
</I>
I second this approach. I think one message we can give to 
non-documented hardware manufacturers is that if that they have 
essentially two choices:

1. No information given and people use their equipment with suboptimal 
results.

2. They give the required information and people are happy with the 
equipment.

Alternative #2 looks better to my eye. The only situation where this is 
against the hardware manufacturer's interests is when they sell the 
hardware cheap to sell expensive software.


Disassembling the Windows binary drivers may not be legal in all 
legislations, but at least in the EU it seems to be legal (and even 
encouraged) by the EU directive 91/250/EEC. Article 6 of the said directive:


&quot;Article 6 Decompilation

1. The authorization of the rightholder shall not be required where 
reproduction of the code and translation of its form within the meaning 
of Article 4 (a) and (b) are indispensable to obtain the information 
necessary to achieve the interoperability of an independently created 
computer program with other programs, provided that the following 
conditions are met:

(a) these acts are performed by the licensee or by another person having 
a right to use a copy of a program, or on their behalf by a person 
authorized to to so;

(b) the information necessary to achieve interoperability has not 
previously been readily available to the persons referred to in 
subparagraph (a); and (c) these acts are confined to the parts of the 
original program which are necessary to achieve interoperability.

2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not permit the information 
obtained through its application:

(a) to be used for goals other than to achieve the interoperability of 
the independently created computer program;

(b) to be given to others, except when necessary for the 
interoperability of the independently created computer program; or (c) 
to be used for the development, production or marketing of a computer 
program substantially similar in its expression, or for any other act 
which infringes copyright.&quot;


(There is a newer copyright directive, 2001/29/EC, but it specifically 
says that it does not limit the rights given in articles 5 and 6 of 
91/250/EEC.)

Clearly, we are allowed to disassemble all necessary software in JLink 
(the directive specifically allows the disassembly of embedded code, as 
well). The exceptions above do not say anything about hardware, but the 
definition of &quot;interoperability says&quot;:


&quot;Whereas the function of a computer program is to communicate and work 
together with other components of a computer system and with users and, 
for this purpose, a logical and, where appropriate, physical 
interconnection and interaction is required to permit all elements of 
software and hardware to work with other software and hardware and with 
users in all the ways in which they are intended to function;

Whereas the parts of the program which provide for such interconnection 
and interaction between elements of software and hardware are generally 
known as 'interfaces`;

Whereas this functional interconnection and interaction is generally 
known as 'interoperability`; whereas such interoperability can be 
defined as the ability to exchange information and mutually to use the 
information which has been exchanged;&quot;


So, the point in the directive is that disassembly is allowed if the aim 
is to make the software (and/or associated hardware) interoperable. I 
think we are discussing exactly that case here.

To my understanding:

- as an EU resident I am allowed to disassemble the JLink drivers (or 
even Windows Vista, greetings to Mr. Gates), if I need to do so to 
promote interoperability

- as an EU resident, I am allowed to publish the details if that is 
required for the interoperability (as certainly is in an open source 
project), as told in article 6 (b).

- if the software (in this case embedded SW/HW) manufacturer publishes 
this information, I am no longer allowed to disassemble the code to find 
the information out (= if you don't want anyone to touch your code, 
publish the interfaces!)


I do not know if US residents are allowed to use and/or distribute 
information obtained this way (legally in Europe) and published (legally 
in Europe) this information. If not, then including code utilizing this 
information may be a problem for the US residents.

Oh, and IANAL (I am not a lawyer). If you end up in court following my 
bad advice, don't blame me. But I have seen some cases with the 
directive above, and they point to the same direction.

- Ville
