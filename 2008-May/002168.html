<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> Try the following:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> openocd&gt; soft_reset_halt
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> openocd&gt; poll
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What happens?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Bingo.  I'm programmed!  I notice soft_reset_halt isn't mentioned in
</I>&gt;<i> the doc's anywhere - should I add it to openfacts?
</I>
I agree. The soft_reset_halt is not too well documented despite the fact 
that it is the canonical way to reset the chip.

I have understood that the command does the following:

- halt the execution
- reset PC (= go to the beginning)
- reset the processor state to the initial state (thumb/32-bit, 
FIQ/interrupt/etc., clear interrupts)

After it the processor is in the state you'd expect to find the 
processor after you have pressed the reset button. However, the 
processor does not know that and regardless of what code you feed it 
with, it'll do something. Usually nothing very clever.

AFAIK, other reset commands try to use the SRST/TRST which may not be 
there. TRST is clearly redundant, as the same functionality (TAP reset) 
should be obtained by sending at least five 1's to TMS. SRST is another 
story, but in the case of ARM, the ICE should be able to hit the core 
with a sledgehammer regardless of the core state.

The reason why we still have SRST and TRST is that not all chip 
manufacturers have been reading the standards too well. And especially 
with the &quot;ICE resets the processor&quot; approach YMMV in many cases. Hence 
SRST. My boards don't have it, but sometimes I have wondered if I try to 
make things too cleanly...
