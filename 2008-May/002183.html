<PRE>Hi List,

I am unable to chain watchpoints, i.e. halt the CPU when a value A is written to address B and then if value C is written to address D.

Side Note: this is usually used to halt the CPU when a specific task is executing a piece of code in a multi-tasking kernel. It is accomplished by configuring Watchpoint 1 with the address in memory of the Process ID and the value of the Process we wish to halt. Watchpoint 0 is then configured with the address of the code that we wish to break on and chained to WP1.

In arm7_9_common.c, arm7_9_set_watchpoint(), I hacked the function to set  Watchpoint 0 with:

Line 362 : embeddedice_set_reg(&amp;arm7_9-&gt;eice_cache-&gt;reg_list[EICE_W0_CONTROL_MASK], 0xff &amp; ~EICE_W_CTRL_CHAIN &amp; ~EICE_W_CTRL_nOPC &amp; ~rw_mask);
Line 363 : embeddedice_set_reg(&amp;arm7_9-&gt;eice_cache-&gt;reg_list[EICE_W0_CONTROL_VALUE], EICE_W_CTRL_ENABLE | EICE_W_CTRL_CHAIN | EICE_W_CTRL_nOPC | (watchpoint-&gt;rw &amp; 1));

Watchpoint 1 is set with:

Line 376 : embeddedice_set_reg(&amp;arm7_9-&gt;eice_cache-&gt;reg_list[EICE_W1_CONTROL_MASK], 0xff &amp; ~EICE_W_CTRL_nOPC &amp; ~rw_mask);
Line 377 : embeddedice_set_reg(&amp;arm7_9-&gt;eice_cache-&gt;reg_list[EICE_W1_CONTROL_VALUE], EICE_W_CTRL_nOPC | (watchpoint-&gt;rw &amp; 1));

Note that the CHAIN bit is set for WP0 and that the ENABLE bit is not set for WP1. The breakpoint is supposed to trigger for WP0 when the CHAIN bit is set by WP1. WP1 should not trigger a breakpoint.

This does not work, because a breakpoint is never triggered when the target is resumed. Has anyone tried chaining watchpoints? Any hints/help?

Thanks in advance,

Pieter Conradie
