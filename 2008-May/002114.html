<PRE>Dear Raphael,

Raphael Bustin:
&gt;<i> To wit: I have an in-house home-brew application, entirely
</I>&gt;<i> in source, which implements a minimal, but complete JTAG
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;toolchain&quot; using parallel-port pins and corresponding driver.
</I>&gt;<i> It's deadly slow.  (Two driver calls with every clock and
</I>&gt;<i> data edge!)
</I>
What kind of driver are you using to access parallel port?
We are talking about Windows, I suppose (?).
Anyway this shall not be that slow in general.
If you are using some custom driver an issue device ioctl or
some other driver routine on every tick, this is the core of the slowness.
According to my experience, the overhead of driver call
(on Windows) is *significant* and the only option is to submit
job to the driver in batches.

&gt;<i> I would like to convert the low-level code in this tool to
</I>&gt;<i> use FTDI's libjtag DLL.  I'll bet there's a file or two in
</I>&gt;<i> oOCD that does something close to what I need.
</I>
Unfortunately (or fortunately), OpenOCD does not make use of libjtag.dll at all,
it just uses ftd2xx.dll (or libftdi as an alternative).

A big fat warning! If you use FTDI (or any other USB device) to bitbang JTAG,
that is submit JTAG ticks one by one, it will be damn f* slooooow,
Much, much slower than legacy parallel port.
Even if you use bit shifting functionality of FT2232 and send data
byte by byte, it will be slow.
Any USB device suffers from high latency (and thus long round trip time),
so in any case you need a queue, and match the delayed read back data against it,
which is exactly what OpenOCD does.

&gt;<i> For the **moment**, I'm not interested in using oOCD in
</I>&gt;<i> its more traditional role as GDB server.  (That will come
</I>&gt;<i> later, pending success with this initial effort.)
</I>
Actually I strongly suggest you to start with OpenOCD rightaway, you save
yourself significant amount of work - I think you would be very disappointed
with the performance of using JTAG over USB unless you implemented queued processing.
A simple calculation - lowest theoretical round trip time for FTDI devices (rather a property of the USB)
is 1 ms, to be realistic, multiply this by 2, so you can simply calculate how poor the performance
would be without a queue.

&gt;<i> Any ideas on where I should start digging?  Mostly, I need
</I>&gt;<i> clear examples on using FTDI's libjtag DLL.
</I>
Cannot help with this, sorry.

&gt;<i> Thanks in advance for any ideas or suggestions.
</I>
I suggest either use proprietary JTAG library by FTDI and
stay with that, or use OpenOCD. Migrating from one to another does not make much sense to me
as these two are totally different.

Best regards,

   Pavel
