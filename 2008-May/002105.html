You mean +12V? I really like this device for its serial port and the power 
supply both of which i use all the time. I used to dislike it for the speed 
but have noticed that the speed has increased something like 40 times(!) 
after upgrading to the newest svn version of openocd.

Now i get load speeds of upto about 20KB/s which is almost like instantaneous. 
I do not know if this is the result of an upgrade in gdb as i upgraded them 
together.

This new version of openocd also installed the configuration files so need not 
maintain one myself. Besides it is easy to still pass your own config when 
needed. But then i noticed that it does not include config for this hardware 
and so im hoping that it would be supported by default. My team here uses an 
deb package that i have built with this config included.

Ps: if any of you are interested in i386 and amd64 deb packages of openocd, 
ill be glad to provide them.
