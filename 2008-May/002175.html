I think we've all narrowed in on the relevant data here; thanks for
bringing me up to speed.  Before ARM, I've never had a jtag device
(fpga, AVR, PIC, etc. etc.) that used more than 4 jtag lines, and
never was a hard reset required.  I'm the kind of guy who wants to use
open software with any of my 5 different brands of dongle to program
any of my 6 different kinds of flash-based jtag devices.  I've also
got a bunch of custom cables made up with tiny little ends on them to
go to tiny little pcb's - the 20pin 2.54mm spaced monster is bigger
than most of my pcb's and was again a suprise when I started playing
ARM.  Any device that doesn't 'play nice' with that paradigm I'm going
to steer away from.  Happy to know the LPC's appear to be fine with
the canonical 4-pin jtag port over openocd...anyone have experience
with Atmel, ST, or Analog Devices in this respect?

Steve
