<PRE>It looks that in case of the second try the target is
running in the UndefHandler. I could start a telnet
session and halt the target. The address was the address
from the UndefHandler.

-&gt; 1. If I remove the daemon_startup reset it had
the same behaviour.

-&gt; 2. I have now use the parts from the target library
and have the behaviour.

-&gt; 3. Removed, and still the same behaviour.

I will check if I can find the version where I can see
the problem the first time.

Regards,

Michael

Some thoughts:

1. you are using daemon_startup reset. This of course makes starting OpenOCD
and restarting a GDB session very different
2. if it is no bother it would be great if you used the target library :-)
We're trying to debug those scripts and now I have no easy way to make
100% sure that I know what your scripts are doing as I would have to
deconstruct
and compare them to what we're using.
3. Remove this, fixed in OpenOCD.

# needed for gdb 6.8 and higher
set mem inaccessible-by-default off

4. Perhaps we should define GDB connect scripts in the target library, i.e.
replace the below an event script defined for the target?

monitor reset
monitor sleep 500
monitor poll
monitor soft_reset_halt
monitor arm7_9 sw_bkpts enable
monitor mww 0xE01FC040 0x0002
monitor mdw 0xE01FC040

5. This target has srst_pulls_trst, so that means the PC will run for a
while
after reset. This means that the target is in a highly undefined state and
timing can greatly affect what registers need to be set up again. Could
it be that you missed a register of some sort that you need to set up?

6. A lot of water has passed under the bridge since 520 and if you
can't find anything between 520 and the latest version, this definitely
points in the direction of srst_pulls_trst &amp; the CPU running for
longer/shorter periods of time, thus setting up some register differently.
If you can find anything between 520 and the latest that would weaken
the srst_pulls_trst timing issue.

7. Try making 520 fail or the latest succeed by adding a longer
run_and_halt  time.
