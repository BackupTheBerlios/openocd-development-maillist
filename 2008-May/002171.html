<PRE>&gt;<i> That's not accurate. TRST and 5x 1 for TMS are not equivalent. TRST resets

</I>
AFAIK, the JTAG standard talks about resetting the TAP. Then after the 
TAP is in a known state, it can be used to configure/read/write/whatever 
everything behind it. I think here the ARM people have not understood 
the JTAG standard, and now we suffer.

I do not really know why the TRST was added to IEEE 1149.1, as it should 
be equivalent to the &quot;five 1's&quot;. One reason I've heard is that if the 
pin is grounded, then the TAP is held in reset, and there won't be any 
ill effects from unconnected JTAG pins floating around. However, this is 
not a good reason (as the pins should be properly terminated in any case).

And yes, my post described the things as I think they were originally 
meant to be. The real world is much more cruel than that, but my point 
of view is that if JTAG was implemented the way it should be, we 
wouldn't need the annoying extra lines. But, yes, it isn't and we 
sometimes need.
