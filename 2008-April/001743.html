Well, I would argue a bit here...
Lest assume (jtag_reset_config &amp; RESET_SRST_PULLS_TRST) is true.
Then if jtag_add_reset(req_tms_or_trst=0, req_srst=1) is called, an error is reported.
If jtag_add_reset(req_tms_or_trst=1, req_srst=1) is called,
either interface_jtag_add_reset(1,1) gets called,
or { jtag_add_end_state(TAP_TLR); jtag_add_tms(); } gets executed

Either way, cur_state gets set to TAP_TLR even without the driver checking for RESET_SRST_PULLS_TRST.
It just happens in wrong order I assuem - jtag_add_tms() is called after asserting SRST (?).

So the situation where driver really needs deducing about cur_state based on SRST assertion
really does not happen in fact...

This might be ok, but I feel like there is rather something wrong in the jtag_add_reset as described above.
And we cannot tell what, before we define its semantic. It is really not clear to me what jtag_add_reset
is supposed to do (I mean the logic which is there before passing srst and trst to lower layer,
especially how it should handle interface without TRST so that the target is ok with that).


&gt;&gt;<i>  Misunderstanding: I meant signal the driver to reset cur_state to TLR here.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  The current code requires driver to deduce this, which I consider unclean
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solution.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed. It's not pretty. It would be better to have this code in the
</I>&gt;<i> jtag.c layer. However, there is no packet that can be queued to
</I>&gt;<i> achieve this. Setting the current state has the side effect of clocking
</I>&gt;<i> out tms's.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Got a patch? :-)
</I>
I am too busy these days to fiddle with this right away, sorry. But I feel like it is
still better to bring it to discussion then


&gt;<i> Letting the driver do this at the lowest level sidestepped the need
</I>&gt;<i> for a new packet.
</I>
Sure.

&gt;&gt;<i>  Or even better: to split it to two API function jtag_add_srst and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> jtag_add_tlr (?).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And perhaps also even clarifying the difference between trst and tms.
</I>
Agreed.
