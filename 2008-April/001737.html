ROM | Flash :)

It's really Flash in most of the LPCs, but at least some of the smallest 
family members (LPC210[123] IIRC) actually use ROM.

The bootloader code can't normally be changed by a user, because the IAP 
routines prevent erase/write of the bootloader block(s).

&gt;<i> &gt;  I always assumed that SRST would stop the JTAG clock on (some) -S cores
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  because the JTAG clock needs to be synchronized to the processor clock,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hence if the processor clock stops, at least some implementations of that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; synchronizer circuit would stop the JTAG clock, too.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; - We've seen lpc2148 being unresponsive to jtag chain validation(only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; 1's returned). Perhaps some interfaces happen to assert/deassert srst
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; during startup and thus chain validation could work on some, but not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; other JTAG devices. Perhaps srst should be asserted/deasserted before
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; jtag chain validation. What delay to use then?? If Dominic is seeing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; this problem, then perhaps it needs to be &gt;1 second???
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  What should have caused your LPC to go through startup? The code might
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; assert TRST (it probably should, if TRST is available), but any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; communication afterwards should be delayed by jtag_ntrst_delay. Assuming
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that delay is large enough to cover internal and external delays,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; communication should work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An interface's implementation of the TRST an SRST could leave the pins
</I>&gt;<i> floating or have transient values during intialisation. I'm thinking that
</I>&gt;<i> openocd should not only deassert trst/srst before validation, but also
</I>&gt;<i> cycle an assertion
</I>&gt;<i> of both pins(as approperiate based upon reset_config + nsrst/ntrst delays).
</I>
If you want &quot;attach&quot; behaviour you can't cycle SRST. Attach of course depends 
on the interface NOT to have transients on the reset pins. Floating pins 
shouldn't matter. It shouldn't matter if nTRST goes briefly low, and nSRST 
will have a pull-up on the board.

&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; - The jtag_add_reset() API does not define what happens when srst &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; trst changes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; at the same time. It could vary depending on the driver
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; I was thinking about changing the high level jtag_add_reset() fn to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; define what it means to change srst &amp; trst at the same time such that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; driver differences no longer matter. I need to digest what you are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; writing and the testing feedback before I could come up with a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; proposal though.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  We could define that behaviour, but whatever we define might be wrong
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for a particular case. If a caller of jtag_add_reset requires a specific
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; order IMHO the right thing would be to use two calls.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We could forbid calls that change both pins at the same time.
</I>
Fine with me.

&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; - today enumeration of the jtag chain happens *before* srst is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; asserted. This is broken if a CPU turns off the jtag interface or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; failed to enable it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  There's hardly anything we can do to enable a target's JTAG interface.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If there's code executing on the target that disables JTAG it will likely
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have it disable by the time we get a chance to examine the chain, since
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we can't guarantee any timing between releasing reset and executing JTAG
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scans. Those devices that are problematic in that regard usually prevent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; debug out of reset as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was thinking that early startup code *enabled* the jtag interface.
</I>&gt;<i> So asserting srst
</I>&gt;<i> and waiting would enable the interface.
</I>
Why should it be necessary to enable the JTAG interface? Normally, the JTAG 
interface is already operational by the time the OpenOCD is launched.

The only scenario I can think of is for example a LPC that's already powered 
when the JTAG interface is attached. Depending on the state of RTCK the JTAG 
pins come up as JTAG or GPIO. If the board's pullup/down resistors normally 
have the JTAG port disabled, a reset would be required to enable the JTAG 
pins. This should be a very rare case, but could be covered by a full reset 
(TRST and SRST) AFTER validation failed, if that's fine with the user.

&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; - since it may be necessary to assert srst before the jtag interface
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; is enabled, then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; target initialization can't talk to the target during initialization
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; since reset can only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; occur *after* target initialization. It would be nice to stop this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; from happening anyway,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; because it would remove one obstacle from launching the gdb &amp; telnet
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; server before the target has been initialized or the jtag chain has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; been verified
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Why should it be necessary to assert srst?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> if the startup code enables the jtag interface, then asserting +
</I>&gt;<i> deasserting srst would
</I>&gt;<i> cause the jtag interface to be anbled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; - perhaps jtag chain enumeration should happen during reset rather
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; than at startup?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  That would be broken in case of srst_pulls_trst (e.g. all LPCs).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I meant during target_process_reset() before asserting reset.
</I>
What would be different if we did it there, instead of where it happens now?

&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; - today there is a srst/trst delay which can be specified. Perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; this is a bit too
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  &gt; low level to handle the situation above.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Not sure what you mean here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we need to assert/deassert srst &amp; let the startup code run to
</I>&gt;<i> enable the jtag interface, then that srst delay would not be
</I>&gt;<i> related to srst delays as such. Perhaps jtag_nsrst_delay is sufficient,
</I>&gt;<i> I'd think so, but I'm not sure.
</I>
See above - I think this is a very rare case.

Dominic
