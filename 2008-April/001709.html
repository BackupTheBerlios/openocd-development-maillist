<PRE>Hi list,

Just tried r535, and both reset halt and reset run worked as expected, but 
after a reset halt, the reset bit in the vector catch register wasn't 
cleared, so a subsequent reset run resulted in a break at 0x0. No idea since 
when this is broken.

I'd like to revert the SVN repository back to r535, unless someone is able to 
spot what change exactly caused the problems I'm seeing.

For the future it would be good if changes of that magnitude get discussed at 
the mailinglist.
Same goes for patches that remove existing functionality - apparently quite a 
few people liked the daemon_startup setting, and usability of daemon_startup 
depends on the reset mode parameter of the target.

Before we move on with changes to the reset/startup/init/script stuff it would 
be good if there was agreement about the direction we should go, including a 
concious write-down of the current state of affairs.
There were changes like starting GDB servers before the startup completed 
where I have no idea how this stuff works, so I'm currently unable to tell 
what the whole startup looks like.

There are several use cases that should be considered:

- Using the OpenOCD from within a makefile for download purposes. I guess 
command line arguments, the config file, and either a separate script file or 
a script integrated in the config file would be nice here.

- Using the OpenOCD on the commandline, either with Telnet or GDB. I 
definitely don't want to type a dozen of command line arguments to have 
functionality that was available before by simply specifying the right 
config.

- Using the OpenOCD remotely. Here, it might be a good thing to be able to 
specify as many configuration settings as possible after startup via the 
command processor (telnet/gdb).

- Something else I didn't think of

Best regards,

Dominic
