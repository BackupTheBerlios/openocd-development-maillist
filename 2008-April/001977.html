<PRE>This might be a basic question as I've just joined the list and I'm working off
the trunk version as of yesterday, but it seems to me that the jtag_delay value 
is being handled incorrectly at least with ft2232 interfaces.

Basically do:

jtag_speed 1200 0
jtag_speed

and you'll always see 0 as the two speed values

src/jtag/ft2232.c

int ft2232_speed(int speed)

HAS
         jtag_speed = speed;

That line shouldn't be there from what I read of the code. I note that a couple
of the other drivers have that too so perhaps there is something I'm not following.

With a patch which removes that single line my device which requires a large 
reset delay but is fine for full speed after that works perfectly.

Otherwise I have to set jtag_speed 1200 and that is slow for everything.
And then I have to set jtag_speed back to 0 for full speed but if a reset is 
required then it messes up unless it is slowed back down first. Those two 
parameters really are needed for
the device I have.

jag.c calls the driver speed code for the first arg then the second arg and the
drivers really shouldn't be setting jtag_speed at all IMHO.
