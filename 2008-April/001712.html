<PRE>I appologize for the regressions and I'll get right on it tomorrow. If
reverting is required I will do that.

The recent changes were done to address power cycle + reset problems which
have plagued OpenOCD.

Reset *really* needs to work in *all* cases, including all cases that worked
before + power cycle &amp; reset.

I'll work on these problems tomorrow.

</I>
daemon_startup is not removed, that was indeed posted as a patch for discussion.

&quot;daemon_startup reset&quot; is equivalent to the following in a startup script:

init
reset

As I mentioned to Spen: perhaps keeping &quot;daemon_startup reset&quot; as a deprecated
synonym  to the above would be a way to go. Another thing that was brought
up was that it would be nice to be able to specify event scripts
inline in a single
configuration script.


&gt;<i>  Before we move on with changes to the reset/startup/init/script stuff it would
</I>&gt;<i>  be good if there was agreement about the direction we should go, including a
</I>&gt;<i>  concious write-down of the current state of affairs.
</I>
This started out as a bug-fix for power cycle + reset. The problems you have
pointed out are plain regressions, not change in behaviour from the
users point of view as such.

It was of course a *big* bugfix/change and we did quite a bit of
testing(including
Michael's complete suite) and the arm926ejs + the above cases now need
to be addressed.

I'd hate to break power cycle + reset, so I want to try to get everything to
work.

&gt;<i>  There were changes like starting GDB servers before the startup completed
</I>&gt;<i>  where I have no idea how this stuff works, so I'm currently unable to tell
</I>&gt;<i>  what the whole startup looks like.
</I>
GDB servers no longer start up before targets are launched. Significant issues
where discovered while attempting that.


&gt;<i>  There are several use cases that should be considered:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - Using the OpenOCD from within a makefile for download purposes. I guess
</I>&gt;<i>  command line arguments, the config file, and either a separate script file or
</I>&gt;<i>  a script integrated in the config file would be nice here.
</I>
These sort of scenarios will be *much* better supported with the &quot;init&quot; command.

&gt;<i>  - Using the OpenOCD on the commandline, either with Telnet or GDB. I
</I>&gt;<i>  definitely don't want to type a dozen of command line arguments to have
</I>&gt;<i>  functionality that was available before by simply specifying the right
</I>&gt;<i>  config.
</I>
There is no requirement to type lots of arguments. I've made some postings
where I've shown what is possible with init + cmd's, but there is no change
to existing scripts. If &quot;init&quot; is ommitted from startup scripts, it's
executed afterwards.
Once executed, subsequent invocations are safe no-op's.

&gt;<i>  - Using the OpenOCD remotely. Here, it might be a good thing to be able to
</I>&gt;<i>  specify as many configuration settings as possible after startup via the
</I>&gt;<i>  command processor (telnet/gdb).
</I>
This would require launching telnet + gdb *before* target init, which I'd love
to see, but it is a bit tricker than I thought. The main problem I've found is
that target are queried for their subtype and the actual register file is
set up afterwards.

GDB queries the register list at startup so the register file needs to be in
place *before* the GDB server can be launched.

I guess it would also be possible to specify that &quot;init&quot; should not be
run automatically so the Telnet session would then start up in Config
mode, though that seems a bit quaint and I don't think it would see
a lot, if any use...

&gt;<i>  - Something else I didn't think of
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Best regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
