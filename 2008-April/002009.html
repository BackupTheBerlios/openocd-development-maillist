<PRE>&gt;<i> The development RAM may go wrong if any single bit in the JTAG 
</I>&gt;<i> communication
</I>&gt;<i> is flipped and there are no means to catch them all.
</I>
With any real communication channel (BER &gt; 0), there is a non-zero 
possibility for an error, no matter what error detection or correction 
is used. However, if you think of the chain I suggested, the possibility 
can be pressed very low. (BER is already low with JTAG, and with a 
decent hash several well-placed errors are required.)

If we think of the possible failure modes:

Error in backing up the memory:
- no way to catch! (reread helps against random errors)

Error in running JTAG TAP:
- OpenOCD catches

Error uploading the DCC upload program:
- Hash catches

DCC comms failure:
- length check + hash catches

Error in uploading the hash calculation code:
- Hash is not calculated correctly (hash catches)

Error in setting the watchpoint:
- Hash checking gets stuck (timeout catch)
- Hash checking exits early (hash value catches)

Error in restoring the memory:
- no way to catch (readback helps against random errors)


But as you can see, it is extremely unlikely that any JTAG communication 
error would result in the file to end up in the RAM with any errors of 
any sort. Almost any random (or non-random) JTAG transfer error will be 
caught at some point.

If done this way, the DCC transfer will become far more secure than the 
non-DCC transfer. The only weak points are related to backing up and 
restoring the scratchpad memory (which isn't always needed).

The price to pay is that the process will take some extra milliseconds 
for loading things (program code, registers) and around 10 clock cycles 
per octet to check (if not inlined). Inlining makes the code faster but 
requires more power from the target and takes some dozens of words space.

And, yes, the same four-word code can be used to check the flash 
contents (or was there some limitation with watchpoints in flash?).

---

But I do agree that the length check is something that must be done 
after each and every DCC transfer. Hash calculation and checking should 
be optional, and it might be beneficial to include that option to 
&quot;traditional&quot; transfers, as well. They are not prone to missing bytes, 
but they are at least as prone to single-bit errors in transfer.

Also, the question of inlined hash calculation is a bit tricky. If we
assume that it takes 50 extra clock cycles per word, that means there 
has to be at least 60 clocks between DCC transfers. As the highest 
reasonable DCC speed is below 50 kW/s (10 MHz JTAG), this means the core 
speed has to be at least 3 MHz. Below that only the rotating sum may 
succeed.

I'll see if I have the time to write the four words of code, so that the 
FNV can be checked. Implementing it as an option to the DCC transfer 
should not be a big deal, but it should ensure that the data is correct 
in the RAM to a very high degree of reliability.
