Hello Ville,

I suspect that there realy is a problem in openocd+ftdi+libftdi(libusb).

I have notices this when analyzing the sources of the driver for FTDI based dongles
and also posted some questions about this to the list, but you seem to be the first
person who spotted the problem in real use (really a surprise, it seems like no one else is using libftdi?).

Although PRESTO (containing FT245) is using a separate driver, it is affected by this too,
as this is common to all FTDI devices. I have fixed this for PRESTO but not for FT2232 dongles,
as I have none here to test it.

So back to the problem itself, please see my previous posts first:
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2008-February/001208.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2008-February/001208.html</A>
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2008-March/001519.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2008-March/001519.html</A>
Especially the first one about PRESTO, the principle is the same for other FTDI devices.

The problem is in the fact, that libusb (on which libftdi relies) is truly synchronous,
thus it does not read data from the USB device in the background.
So the limitation is in the buffer size inside the device, which is
(I believe) just 128 bytes. So if the chunk of data being sent
to FTDI device induces more than 128 bytes of read back data, the buffer overruns.

As you noticed, this does not happen with FTD2XX, because it continuously reads
out the data from the USB device in the background and stores it in much larger buffer
on the host computer (up to 64KB with FTD2XX on Windows, according to observations).

PRESTO driver solves this simply like this:

#if BUILD_PRESTO_FTD2XX == 1
	if (presto-&gt;buff_out_pos &gt;= BUFFER_SIZE)
#elif BUILD_PRESTO_LIBFTDI == 1
	/* libftdi does not do background read, be sure that USB IN buffer does not overflow (128 bytes only!) */
	if (presto-&gt;buff_out_pos &gt;= BUFFER_SIZE || presto-&gt;buff_in_exp==128)
#endif
		return presto_flush();

Please note the test for expected bytes to be read (presto-&gt;buff_in_exp==128).

However, if the chunks are kept short enough to prevent buffer overruns, the performance is certainly
low because of the USBs round trip time (being several milliseconds).

The only way to obtain good performance with FTDI using open source solution only
is to completely reimplement libftdi using native OS API like URB in Linux
(I already mentioned that libusb is synchronous).

Best regards,
   Pavel

&gt;<i> I have just installed OpenOCD in Ubuntu with ftdilib support.
</I>&gt;<i> Everything else goes rather fine, but when I try to move larger
</I>&gt;<i> blocks with arm7_9 fast_memory_access enabled, the FTDI driver
</I>&gt;<i> dies.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know this is a known problem. I played around for some time
</I>&gt;<i> with the FT2232_BUFFER_SIZE. With 1024 it works, with 2048 it
</I>&gt;<i> does not. The speed is somewhat disappointing with that setting.
