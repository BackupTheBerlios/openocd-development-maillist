<PRE>&gt;<i> I am pretty sure, that libftdi does not do background read.
</I>
You are absolutely and exactly correct.

I talked with one of the libftdi developers. He confirmed that your 
analysis of the situation is correct. (Not that I'd have doubted it, 
anyway.)

What seems to be new information is that FTDI's own FTD2XX driver for 
Linux actually uses libftdi. FTD2XX just uses threads to constantly poll 
the device in background.

So, it seems that if we want to get good performance with libftdi, we 
need to do something similar. Not very nice, though. Not very portable, 
either. Or then we need to wait for libftdi to pick up libusb-1.0 or get 
a threaded version.

However, there is something we might be able to do with a reasonable 
amount of work. As you have pointed out, the problem is not on the 
writing side, it's on the reading side. So, even if we write a lot, 
there is no problem if we do not read too much. (I hope I've got it 
finally right...)

I think we could track the number of octets we expect to read. If we 
limit that number to 128 much in the same way as the write buffer is 
limited, we should be safe. That gives the maximum performance available 
with current libftdi.
