<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>I am using OpenOCD for production to program a flash chip attached to an 
ARM (more specifically, AM29DL163DB attached to AT91R40008). I am using 
a init script to achieve this, but I find the limitations of the script 
rather bad.

The steps my script takes:
- start OpenOCD
- soft reset
- set on a couple of LEDs (a bunch of mww's)
- program chip selects (again a bunch of mww's)
- enable DCC transfers
- move the compressed flash image to RAM (around 200 kB)
- move the programmer into RAM (a few kB)
- run the programmer
- shutdown


This is done over and over for--say--a hundred times. And it works 
rather fine. However, there is very little feedback from the process. If 
anything goes wrong, the operator must notice it by the LEDs on the 
target card. Also, the server shuts down well before the flashing is over.

I think I could get rid of the shutdown problem by using a breakpoint 
(assuming that the break ever comes), but then the target would be run 
into halt, which is not desirable (the LEDs would stop blinking).

So, what I would like to do:

- soft reset
- memory writes as above
- starting the program
- polling the DCC register to see what the program is doing
- shutdown when I am happy

This would naturally require conditional execution of things (polling 
the DCC), etc. This could be achieved by expanding the scripting system, 
but I do not think that is very practical. Instead I have been thinking 
of two different approaches:

- Using expect-like interaction with OpenOCD telnet interface. This 
would mean starting the server, interacting with the user interface 
through TCP port 4444, checking that nothing went wrong and shutting 
down. A lot of work, as there is no direct command interface with 
OpenOCD; I would need to interact with two processes.

- Use the OpenOCD JTAG/ARM communication API directly. This is what I 
like more, but are there any examples around? What should I do with the 
config file?


Sorry for the long post, but I have been getting a bad headache trying 
to find out which one makes me happier...

- Ville

(BTW, 2 MiB of empty flash is programmed this way in 11 seconds. Not bad.)
