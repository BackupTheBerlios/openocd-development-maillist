<PRE>Hello Michael,

Neither of these two is the case of OpenOCD, there is another approach:
The write operation erases all sectors which are to be touched by write.

We might say: &quot;ok, if someone wants to do more flash write_image operations
have him/her to disable auto_erase.

BUT!!!

I just looked into the sources and found out, that flash_write() does not watch
sector boundaries, so to calm down the auto_erase enthusiasm, I must say, that
current implementation is *broken*, as it does not work even for a single
flash write_image operation! Sad but true.

So what is broken then?
If I read the sources correctly, it is exactly the case of two writes which go into the same sector,
and this might happen not only in case of user issuing flash write_image two or more times,
but also in a single operation (!), if the image to be written contains non-consecutive sections
which fall into a single sector - I can easily imagine such situation.

Example:
section1 0x0e0 to 0x150
section2 0x180 to 0x1ff
while erase sector size is 0x100 long, in such case both sections touch sector 0x100 to 0x1ff,
which would get erased twice, loosing part of the section1.

&gt;<i> - either only erase when a write operation spans the start of a sector. 
</I>&gt;<i> That way, further writes will not erase anything that was written 
</I>&gt;<i> before, if we write in ascending address order.
</I>
This is a good method and also use it in situations it fits,
unfortunately this would not work for OpenOCD either, because it works fine only for consecutive data,
but not if a block of data begins in the middle of a sector.

&gt;<i> - or: check for the old contents and only do an erase if any bit needs 
</I>&gt;<i> to be programmed from 0 to 1. That would also handle the already-erased 
</I>&gt;<i> case, but would introduce some overhead by reading the whole block 
</I>&gt;<i> first. Maybe this can be reduced to some kind of status flag for each 
</I>&gt;<i> sector.
</I>
This is a near perfect method in the terms it is generic enough, but it would be damn slow.

Because of above I strongly recommend staying with auto_erase *disabled* by default,
as it has nasty pitfalls. The user may not know that the linker script has not aligned sections
to sector boundary.

It is hard to implement this the perfect way or at least without these unpleasant pitfalls
- until they are gone, please consider keeping it disabled by default.

Regards,
   Pavel
