<PRE>&gt;<i> First of all, we need a check on correct number of words being
</I>&gt;<i> received by DCC download routine running on the target,
</I>&gt;<i> if this matches, it means everything went smooth.
</I>
Yup. That check at least makes it sure that no words were
missed. And that check does not require any extra code for
the target (as the index register can be checked afterwards).

&gt;<i> Actually, the code looks still pretty long.
</I>
Well. Anything that splits 32-bit words into octets will
need to use around twenty instruction cycles per word, at 
least. But in this case the pseudo-C code may look longer 
than the real assembly code. Also, the code size may be shrunk
a bit at the expense of execution time (loop).

But see below for a very small-space high-intergrity solution.

---

&gt;<i> Well, data upload to RAM is typically a development, not a production
</I>&gt;<i> thing, so eve basic check preventing just data overrun (which is the
</I>&gt;<i> most critical thing here) would be fine.
</I>&gt;<i> In case of programming flash memory, it is good to have some stronger check
</I>&gt;<i> afterwards, but this is rather task for a flash driver.
</I>
If my development RAM image is wrong, I suffer for an hour figuring 
out what went wrong. If something goes wrong in production, I may 
suffer a week at a customer's site in a jungle somewhere far away 
with some very angry people around. No airconditioning, wierd
food, no Internet.

But I need to get the program in there fast. Fast and secure is
a bad combination, but I am trying. So, I upload a compressed
(simple RLE) flash image into RAM and then the flasher code burns
it into the flash.

As the image is compressed, I need to know it is correct before
doing anything with it (as missing words or similar things may
wreak havoc in decompression). So, I run a CRC over that. It
would be even safer to run a CRC on the flash, as well, but
that takes a considerable amount of time with a 2-megabyte flash.
(And if the flash is broken, then we have problems anyway, so
let's just assume it isn't.)

At the moment I am using around 11-14 s with a 2 MB flash
containing a file system and some software. (FT2232-based
programmer in use, empty flash to start with.)

On the other hand, time is not a real issue with development code.
I have a 200 kB image in the RAM and check its intergrity in
much less than a second (dry decompress, calculate CRC16). Even
though development is usually done in a hurry, not often in that 
hurry.

&gt;<i> Either the code has to be uploaded along with the DCC downloader, 
</I>&gt;<i> which eats memory, or afterwards, which adds a communication 
</I>&gt;<i> turnaround, which is exactly what fast writes try to avoid.
</I>
True, but... An &quot;afterwards FNV&quot; code:

hash = OFFSET_BASIS;
for (;;)
  {
  data = *ptr++;
  hash *= FNV_MULTIPLIER;
  hash ^= data;
  }

Now, as everything is in registers, hash can be preloaded, 
FNV_MULTIPLIER can be preloaded, ptr can be preloaded. 
Then the loop itself has actually only a fetch from memory
(with incremet), XOR, multiplication and a branch. No
conditional branching, as we can take care of that with a
watchpoint in the data. Looks like 4 instruction words.

So, then the full cycle from the OpenOCD side is:

- backup the DCC uploader code memory (6 words)
- upload the DCC uploader
- set the relevant register (*ptr)
- run the uploader and flood DCC with data
- halt the uploader when done

- check the *ptr register for correct value

- upload the FNV code in place of the uploader (4 words)
- upload the relevant registers (*ptr, FNV_MULTIPLIER, hash)
- set up a watchpoint to the end of the data
- wait till the watchpoint triggers
- get the hash (1 register), check it
- restore the code memory (6 words)

This is slower than calculating on the fly, but still it
takes maybe ten cycles per octet, which means a rate of
100000 kB/s / MHz. (That is, 10 MB/s for a 100 MHz core.)
This adds considerable overhead for small transfers (setting
the watchpoint, mainly), but for large transfers the setup
overhead is negligible.

How'bout?
