Thanks for the reassurance...I've been feeling like I've broken the
world here.  

To answer a couple of things at a time:

I haven't built all of openocd under CodeWarrior at all, just the
helper and jtag directories, as I'm trying to pull those libraries into
a custom program that does very specific odd things for my company's 
processor. (The resulting program has no other licensing restriction,
so I hope that isn't objectionable.) It may be relevant that my particular
CodeWarrior is from 2002, although I've looked at one later
installation and it also doesn't have &lt;sys/time.h&gt;

(I do also have cygwin installed, so I did take care to verify my builds
under cygwin.)

If AC_C_VARARRAYS is causing trouble, either one of these choices
would be fine with me: one is to make the variable-length array be
a &quot;big-enough&quot; fixed array, which is unnerving; the other is for
everyone else to ignore the whole problem and I can re-apply that 
change locally when next I update my world.  There are already a 
couple of other things that were just too hairy for me to propose to 
integrate into the mainline openocd, so I already know that I would 
have to merge those things back into any further rev from the outside 
world.

Whichever way you want to go on AC_C_VARARRAYS, I can generate the patch
and send it to you if you want, on the &quot;you broke it, you fix it&quot; theory.
