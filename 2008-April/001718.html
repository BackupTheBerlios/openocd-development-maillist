<PRE>More reset fixes committed, not quite done yet I think.

arm926ejs below refers to the case where srst locks up JTAG clk.

- Will &quot;reset halt&quot; work with arm926ejs if &quot;reset_config srst_only&quot; is used?
In this case trst is not asserted and, hopefully, that will stop the reset
vector catch from being cleared. This assumes that TRST clears
the reset vector catch  and that TMS does not.

- has &quot;resume&quot; + &quot;reset halt&quot; ever worked with arm926ejs? In this
case trst was asserted, which I would expect to clear the reset vector
catch.


This is the list of outstanding reset problems as far as I know:


- if srst locks up the JTAG clock, then the halt issued while arm7/9 has
reset asserted will be ignored =&gt; reset halt/init won't work. If trst
is in use, then trst will reset embedded ICE and that would
clear the reset vector catch. For now the only solution I see is to
use srst_only for the case where srst locks up then jtag clk.
- arm7/9 code can not know *why* communication failed while reset
was asserted, but it may be able to detect that communication failed.
I don't know whether or not this can be detected in a robust fashion.
There is no target configuration option to tell arm7/9 code
that the jtag clock is locked up while srst is asserted. Should there be
such an option? The only thing that could be done would be not to
assert trst so that the reset vector catch won't get cleared, which can
be achieved via srst_only.
- since reset can be issued while the target and openocd are out of
sync, e.g. reset after power cycle, the reset code will be broken
if it acts upon the assumption that the target is in a particular state
or other(as it did previously).
- if srst locks up the jtag clk, it appears as if the the embedded ICE
registers aren't cleared upon asserting trst. Dominic showed a trace
where &quot;reset halt&quot; + &quot;reset run&quot; resulted in reset run catching the
reset vector(or halt at address 0 anyway). OpenOCD tried to
assert trst &amp; srst upon &quot;reset run&quot;. I would have expected the
reset vector catch to be cleared. Perhaps the reset vector catch
isn't cleared when trst is asserted? Perhaps srst does not lock up
the jtag clk, but rather disconnects all JTAG circuitry so TRST
asserted isn't &quot;heard&quot; by the target?


Fixes:

- only if &quot;reset halt&quot; or &quot;reset init&quot; are issued will the reset
vector be set up
- If communication fails during assert between assert/deassert and during
assert, warnings are printed. The warning suggests using srst_only if the
clock locks up as that would allow the reset vector to be set up before
asserting reset.
