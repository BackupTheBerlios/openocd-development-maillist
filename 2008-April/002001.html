Hello &#216;yvind,

&#216;yvind Harboe napsal(a):
&gt;<i> The eCos flash driver really is a tiny framework to write up
</I>&gt;<i> your own flash driver writing only target code.
</I>
&gt;<i> I'm thinking about renaming the eCos flash driver.
</I>&gt;<i> Would anyone out there use it?
</I>
&gt;<i> The idea is that a developer has target code to write flash
</I>&gt;<i> that he can execute via OpenOCD.
</I>
the ecos driver looks reasonable, although I have not tested it yet.
The purpose is similar to my OCL driver I have just reposted as a patch against trunk
with flashing code for at91sam7x as an example.

The aim of these two drivers is really similar, however, each has its pros and cons.
It might be a good idea to merge the best from the to into a single standard
semi-hosted flash loader interface.

Cons of the ocl driver:
- does not do load flasher image automatically.
- communicates over DCC, thus cannot be used with MCUs without DCC

Cons of the ecos driver:
- loads flasher image in every operation, this might be highly inefficient
in case of incremental writes of larger data (e.g. through GDB protocol I communicate through this from GUI)
optionally flasher loading might be done in probe routine only.
- does not feature probe and sector size

None of the drivers features verification by a checksum.
What about defining requirements for such semi-hosted flashing and then try to merge this?

A note about DCC based fast writes:
ecos driver relies on memory writes. DCC would be typically used (if there is any) to achieve maximum performance.
This might fail in case of target running too slowly, may flash wrong data in the worst case,
making it unreliable for production programming.
A checksum would help in this, however, the check should be done also on lower level of
memory writes. As this is rather separate topic, please see my proposal for solution in following post.

Best regards,
   Pavel
