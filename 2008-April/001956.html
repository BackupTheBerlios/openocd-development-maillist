<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i>  Well, define &quot;fail&quot;. If a DCC transfer is outrun there's data corruption,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and currently no way to detect that. Fast memory writes are less critical,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because the handshaking signals are evaluated after the transfer completed -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it's too late to correct anything at that point, but at least we know something went wrong.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not quite sure what you are asking. Any definition of &quot;fail&quot; would be
</I>&gt;<i> invariant whether the fast option exists or not.
</I>
To my eye it seems that the only problem is that with slow targets, some 
words may be missed during transfer as the target is not fast enough 
reading them.

If we get to read the correct number of words, we have caught everything 
(as the relevant bit in the DCC status register is set when written and 
reset when read). There may be race conditions, but without any deeper 
analysis it seems that all of them result in a missing word. (Of course, 
if there is a danger of a corrupted word, that's another thing.)

So... If we read r0 (or whatever the index register is in the stm 
command, I did not bother to disassemble 0xe4801004) after the transfer 
and check the index against base+size, then we should know if the 
transfer failed. If it failed, the program can easily complain and 
automatically switch to the safer method.

This would only need an extra register read and some simple arithmetics.

CRC would be the &quot;foolproof&quot; (never underestimate fools!) solution, but 
it requires either a lot of time or extra space.
