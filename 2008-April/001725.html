The arm926ejs that Dominic is working with shows evidence of failing to
communicate immediately after SRST is released. That would match what you are
describing above.



What you are describing has a number of interesting aspects. I haven't
quite thought it through, but some things come to mind:

- We've seen lpc2148 being unresponsive to jtag chain validation(only 1's
returned). Perhaps some interfaces happen to assert/deassert srst during
startup and thus chain validation could work on some, but not other JTAG
devices. Perhaps srst should be asserted/deasserted before jtag chain
validation. What delay to use then?? If Dominic is seeing this problem,
then perhaps it needs to be &gt;1 second???

- The jtag_add_reset() API does not define what happens when srst &amp;
trst changes
at the same time. It could vary depending on the driver implementation.

I was thinking about changing the high level jtag_add_reset() fn to define what
it means to change srst &amp; trst at the same time such that driver differences
no longer matter. I need to digest what you are writing and the testing feedback
before I could come up with a proposal though.

- today enumeration of the jtag chain happens *before* srst is asserted. This is
broken if a CPU turns off the jtag interface or failed to enable it.

- since it may be necessary to assert srst before the jtag interface
is enabled, then
target initialization can't talk to the target during initialization
since reset can only
occur *after* target initialization. It would be nice to stop this
from happening anyway,
because it would remove one obstacle from launching the gdb &amp; telnet server
before the target has been initialized or the jtag chain has been verified

- perhaps jtag chain enumeration should happen during reset rather
than at startup?

- today there is a srst/trst delay which can be specified. Perhaps
this is a bit too
low level to handle the situation above.
