The &quot;problem&quot; conceptually is that the calao device is both a board and an 
interface combined into one and there isn't such a concept currently. I think 
there is likely to be a pile more of these given the increased usage of ARM SoC 
setups which include on-board USB.

I took a stab at what I thought was a reasonable split between interface 
configuration and target configuration for calao devices - but perhaps others 
have different views on that. My thinking was to allow smaller simple 
configuration files with as much shared configuration so we don't end up with 
essentially repeating the same configuration in a pile of places but that did 
mean using 'script' inside the configuration files effectively as a #include 
mechanism.

Another thought from having walked through the code in ft2232.c is that a lot of 
the logic is in common between the devices and could be moved out into 
configuration files rather than coded up as a set of code where the main 
difference is a set of PIN mappings. If I have to add another variation of pin 
mappings I may just tackle that myself if there isn't any other planned stuff in 
that area.

Tim.
