<PRE>Just FYI, R544 is still broken for me.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; enables the JTAG pins only if there is no &quot;Content Read Protection&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; enabled (set by a bit in internal flash, read by the boot loader).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  I don't know if the fact the JTAG pins come up disabled is a property of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  the ARM7TDMI-S core specifically, or something NXP have done on the LPCs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - it may well be the latter in this case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The arm926ejs that Dominic is working with shows evidence of failing to
</I>&gt;<i> communicate immediately after SRST is released. That would match what you
</I>&gt;<i> are describing above.
</I>
Communicating IMMEDIATELY after releasing SRST is wrong, if the target 
specified a jtag_n[st]rst_delay. Is that what your patch does?

There are at least two factors that could delay a target's ability to 
communicate after a reset (either S or T reset, assuming that S affects the 
target's ability to communicate via JTAG):

- internal reset delays of the target
- external reset delays caused by the board (e.g. power supervisor)

&gt;<i> What you are describing has a number of interesting aspects. I haven't
</I>&gt;<i> quite thought it through, but some things come to mind:
</I>
This is something different. The LPCs come up with the JTAG pins ENABLED, no 
matter what the user's manual is trying to tell us. Very early in the 
internal boot ROM that's always executed first (except for devices with no 
flash, but on those devices CRP would be useless anyway), the JTAG pins are 
disabled by means of the PINSEL register (GPIO pin control). If CRP is NOT 
enabled, the JTAG pins will be re-enabled at some point, and control is 
transfered to the user application.

I always assumed that SRST would stop the JTAG clock on (some) -S cores 
because the JTAG clock needs to be synchronized to the processor clock, hence 
if the processor clock stops, at least some implementations of that 
synchronizer circuit would stop the JTAG clock, too.

&gt;<i> - We've seen lpc2148 being unresponsive to jtag chain validation(only 1's
</I>&gt;<i> returned). Perhaps some interfaces happen to assert/deassert srst during
</I>&gt;<i> startup and thus chain validation could work on some, but not other JTAG
</I>&gt;<i> devices. Perhaps srst should be asserted/deasserted before jtag chain
</I>&gt;<i> validation. What delay to use then?? If Dominic is seeing this problem,
</I>&gt;<i> then perhaps it needs to be &gt;1 second???
</I>
What should have caused your LPC to go through startup? The code might assert 
TRST (it probably should, if TRST is available), but any communication 
afterwards should be delayed by jtag_ntrst_delay. Assuming that delay is 
large enough to cover internal and external delays, communication should 
work.

&gt;<i> - The jtag_add_reset() API does not define what happens when srst &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> trst changes
</I>&gt;<i> at the same time. It could vary depending on the driver implementation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was thinking about changing the high level jtag_add_reset() fn to define
</I>&gt;<i> what it means to change srst &amp; trst at the same time such that driver
</I>&gt;<i> differences no longer matter. I need to digest what you are writing and the
</I>&gt;<i> testing feedback before I could come up with a proposal though.
</I>
We could define that behaviour, but whatever we define might be wrong for a 
particular case. If a caller of jtag_add_reset requires a specific order IMHO 
the right thing would be to use two calls.

&gt;<i> - today enumeration of the jtag chain happens *before* srst is asserted.
</I>&gt;<i> This is broken if a CPU turns off the jtag interface or failed to enable
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>
There's hardly anything we can do to enable a target's JTAG interface. If 
there's code executing on the target that disables JTAG it will likely have 
it disable by the time we get a chance to examine the chain, since we can't 
guarantee any timing between releasing reset and executing JTAG scans. Those 
devices that are problematic in that regard usually prevent debug out of 
reset as well.

&gt;<i> - since it may be necessary to assert srst before the jtag interface
</I>&gt;<i> is enabled, then
</I>&gt;<i> target initialization can't talk to the target during initialization
</I>&gt;<i> since reset can only
</I>&gt;<i> occur *after* target initialization. It would be nice to stop this
</I>&gt;<i> from happening anyway,
</I>&gt;<i> because it would remove one obstacle from launching the gdb &amp; telnet server
</I>&gt;<i> before the target has been initialized or the jtag chain has been verified
</I>
Why should it be necessary to assert srst?

&gt;<i> - perhaps jtag chain enumeration should happen during reset rather
</I>&gt;<i> than at startup?
</I>
That would be broken in case of srst_pulls_trst (e.g. all LPCs).

&gt;<i> - today there is a srst/trst delay which can be specified. Perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> this is a bit too
</I>&gt;<i> low level to handle the situation above.
</I>
Not sure what you mean here.

Dominic
