</I>
Sure, there's no handshaking, which is why DCC and fast_memory_writes is 
faster. In theory there could be a DCC with handshaking, but that would be 
slower than the normal, handshaked memory write (4 byte vs. 14 x 4 byte per 
handshake).

&gt;<i> Why is arm7_9 fast_memory_writes and dcc_downloads separate options?
</I>
Because they're completely unrelated.

&gt;<i> If I changed the default, I'd want to add a small section troubleshooting

</I>
I don't think it's a good idea to change this default. Even if both options 
work in the majority of cases, this is something that could easily fail, 
because it relies on the JTAG interface being slow enough for the combination 
of target clock and target memory (e.g. more waitstates on external memory).

&gt;<i> &gt;  Both options turn on some optimization, and should only be enabled
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if it's guaranteed that the requirements are fulfilled.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> they have other, more demanding and interesting problems, than
</I>&gt;<i> to tinker with OpenOCD configs :-)
</I>
The OpenOCD works fine without those two options.

&gt;<i> The default options should be robust, yet at some point they
</I>&gt;<i> also need to give decent performance.
</I>
Basically these two options are not just not robust, but technically wrong. 
They just happen to work, if used with care.

&gt;<i> So, currently I'm thinking:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - make a single fast_memory_writes option. Does this need
</I>&gt;<i> to be arm7/9 specific?
</I>
No idea about other targets. I remember a commit from you that made a 
separate &quot;fast writes&quot; (or was it reads?) access for XScales obsolete.

&gt;<i> - retire dcc memory downloads
</I>
We could get rid of the separate DCC option, but the code should then be 
changed to verify a working area is available, otherwise the log could be 
full of warnings.

I'm not sure if DCC downloads is completely free of side effects. For the 
target, DCC downloads are no different than normal execution, and therefor 
e.g. watchdogs that are disabled in halt mode could interfere with larger 
memory writes. If there's a chance of dcc downloads breaking anything we need 
to keep the option. The current fast_memory_writes option wouldn't be 
affected by this, hence we might need to keep them separate.

&gt;<i> - make fast_memory_writes = on default.
</I>&gt;<i> - add something in the troubleshooting section in openocd.pdf
</I>&gt;<i> to suggest disabling working memory &amp;  fast_memory_Writes,
</I>&gt;<i> try different rest + post reset speeds, etc.
</I>
No, please don't that, for all the reasons listed above.

Regards,

Dominic
