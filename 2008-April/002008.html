Hello Ville,

Ville Voipio napsal(a):
&gt;<i>  &gt; Well, data upload to RAM is typically a development, not a production
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; thing, so eve basic check preventing just data overrun (which is the
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; most critical thing here) would be fine.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; In case of programming flash memory, it is good to have some stronger 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; check
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; afterwards, but this is rather task for a flash driver.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If my development RAM image is wrong, I suffer for an hour figuring
</I>&gt;<i> out what went wrong.
</I>
The development RAM may go wrong if any single bit in the JTAG communication
is flipped and there are no means to catch them all.
All we can do in this is to believe, that &quot;it just works&quot;.
In light of this, it is quiet disputable whether extensive checking of just write
operation using DCC, which is only done on certain targets,
and only if fast writes are enabled makes sense at all - there are many more
unchecked (uncheckable) operations which may cause problems.
No doubt about overrun check, this has to be done because of nature of the way of communication, of course.

&gt;<i> If something goes wrong in production, I may
</I>&gt;<i> suffer a week at a customer's site in a jungle somewhere far away
</I>&gt;<i> with some very angry people around. No airconditioning, wierd
</I>&gt;<i> food, no Internet.
</I>
I feel the same, but my belief is that the CRC (or whatever) check shall be done
on a higher level (flash driver - production level, image upload - development)
so that it may be possibly used across various targets.
That is, JTAG debugging (including memory writes using DCC) is a communication link which works or it fails.
and reliability shall be built on top of it, not inside it (as there is probably no way to achieve this).
This approach would also catch holes in flash memory for example - end to end verification.

&gt;<i> This is slower than calculating on the fly, but still it
</I>
Calculation on the fly is not good for decrease of max. JTAG speed which may be used,
so that overrun does not happen. Really bad if the JTAG hardware supports
JTAG speed in several steps only, that is, going just one speed lower means
a significant performance drop.

&gt;<i> the watchpoint, mainly), but for large transfers the setup
</I>&gt;<i> overhead is negligible.
</I>&gt;<i> How'bout?
</I>
I suggest adding just a check for overun and use checksumming rather on a higher level.

Regards,
   Pavel
