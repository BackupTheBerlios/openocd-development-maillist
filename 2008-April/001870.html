If two images are to be written to the flash (e.g. bootloader and main code)
and these two go into single erase sector, the sector would be erased before first write,
and also before the second one, loosing the part programmed in the first step.
It is true that it is typically aim of the developer to place each image in separate
erase sector, however, depending on how large the sector is, it might not be possible.

Of course it is possible to turn auto erase off in such situation, but it might be *misleading*
when enabled.

&gt;<i> Why would flash write to same area fail if auto erase
</I>&gt;<i> was implemented correctly?
</I>
See above.

&gt;&gt;<i> User shall be aware wtah (s)he is doing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Could you elaborate on what this means in this context?
</I>
Auto erase wipes whole sector even if just a single byte is written to the flash.
This is, of course, nature of flash devices. I just mean, I do not like the
debugger to do what did not tell it to do.
User shall be aware that auto erase is enabled and what it does.
This is best achieved by having it enabled explicitly by the user.
This point seems probably most important to me.

&gt;<i> I know a lot about OpenOCD, but I'm happy w/blissful ignorance until
</I>&gt;<i> there is a reason that I need to worry about these nitty gritties.
</I>
On the other hand, there are people who rather have it under control (like me).

&gt;&gt;<i>  Second, some parts do feature erase before write on their own in the hardware,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  thus auto_erase is of no use here, only the FLASH gets worn sooner.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is possible to turn off auto_erase. We're not going to remove it, only
</I>&gt;<i> change the default.
</I>
I understand that, but why shall users of such devices be discriminated
for just lazyness of others who simply &quot;like&quot; auto erase?

&gt;<i> I'm not convinced that flash wear is relevant for OpenOCD + GDB,
</I>&gt;<i> which is a development tool. Developer abuse(cursing alone,
</I>&gt;<i> let alone if you take physical manipulation into account) would kill it
</I>&gt;<i> long before the flash goes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can you give me some numbers on flash wear problems for developers?
</I>&gt;<i> More common than being hit by lightening? By an asteroid? :-)
</I>
I am not telling that this is a problem, I meant that auto_erase is of no use in such case,
besides flash wear. Do not take this one as serious ;-)
