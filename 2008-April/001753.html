Actually, TLR probably shall not be done using TMS in this case
(because SRST already does pull TRST, see below).


&gt;<i> That depends on what srst_pulls_trst means. Does it mean

</I>

I am not really sure about that, but my understanding is that srst_pulls_trst informs OpenOCD
about hardware configuration, it is not a request for software behavior simulating pulling TRST upon SRST assertion.

That is, it tells OpenOCD that SRST assertion also does reset of the TAP controller, because it is wired so.
It does not instruct OpenOCD to pull TRST when SRST is asserted (but I may be mistaken).
We shall probably precisely define what it actually means before we go on for some changes in this area.


Some more notes about recent changes and related stuff:
the prototype of jtag_add_reset as you changed it - void jtag_add_reset(int req_tms_or_trst, int srst)
seems pretty confusing to me. Probably more confusing than it was before.
Unless I knew, I really would not understand what req_tms_or_trst means as TMS stands for &quot;test mode select&quot;.
The paremeter shall rather be named after the TAP state it really requests, which is TLR,
standing for &quot;test logic reset&quot;. Because TRST assertion is the preferred way to reset
the TAP controller (and it should be, if possible), I would put this in the identifier as first,
resulting in req_trst_or_tlr.

Hence the prototype shall read void jtag_add_reset(int req_trst_or_tlr, int srst)
what do you think?


w.r.t. to previous discussion, I am not sure whether is is necessary to forbid simultaneous assertion
of SRST and TRST (requiring JTAG layer to track the state of the reset lines - every state information
is source of possible problems).
I would leave this up to the caller to do one by one assertion voluntary, if needed.
What definitely should be defined is the behavior in configurations without TRST line.
As we discussed, the transition to TLR by TMS is performed _after_ SRST is already asserted in such case,
which I assume to be wrong (problems with -S cores, practical experiences, anyone?),
reversing the order of these two steps might help (but it shall be defined it is done so).

Also as we discussed it is probably not good to require driver to deduce transition to TLR state from reset_config
(when srst_pulls_trst). I suggest modifying prototype of interface_jtag_add_reset to
interface_jtag_add_reset(int trst, int srst, int tlr).
The driver would update cur_state to TLR if trst OR tlr is true, without checking for srst
(which is responsibility of jtag_add_reset).


Please feel free to implement the suggestions which you like, I do not have much time for coping with this right now
to provide a patch.

Regards,
   Pavel
