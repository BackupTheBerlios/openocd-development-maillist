<PRE>&gt;<i> Thanks for taking a look.  We can't control TCK frequency well since we
</I>&gt;<i> use FTDI.
</I>
OTOH, with FTDI2232 you have the possibility to control the maximum baud 
rate quite precisely. In this case, a divisor of 16 will give you 400 
kHz, which is within the specs.

Honestly, I find the restrictions given by the datasheet very odd, because:

- the number of TCK cycles for the program operation is a minimum, i.e., 
you may spend longer

- the minimum program/erase wait time (= worst-case programming time) is 
specified in the app.note, no maximum (either in terms of number of 
cycles or in terms of time)

- there are planty of parallel port programmers for MSP430, and there 
are FT2232-based programmers for MSP430; very very few pieces of 
programming hardware actually guarantee the timing to the accuracy given


A possibility is that the MSP430 flash memory controller clock is 
somehow connected to TCK. If this is the case, then another approach has 
to be taken (i.e., similar to that with ARM).

But this is something MSP430 people may be able to tell you straight away.

&gt;<i> Right -- in fact we will have the dual FTDI chip on the motherboard
</I>&gt;<i> anyway.  We use one of those channels for JTAG and the other for serial
</I>&gt;<i> console normally, but we can consider to mux that controlled by RTS /
</I>&gt;<i> CTS or so.  Then we have neat built-in low level access to CPU by JTAG,
</I>&gt;<i> MSP430 by UART, and Linux serial console.
</I>
Sounds very good!
