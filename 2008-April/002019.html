</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  We're just starting to think about how to pull this off. We suspect

</I>
Currently only Cortex and ARM are supported by OpenOCD.

Architecturally the problem is that flash drivers have bits of ARM
code built in.

I know nothing about how the MSP430 goes about flash programming /
code running on the target or whether this is something that ARM
is particularly dependent on for decent performance.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - we're not sure it OpenOCD will work with multiple CPUs in the
</I>&gt;<i>   JTAG chain
</I>
It should work fine. Just define the devices and tie up the ARM target
to the correct device.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - we're also not sure if the TRST/SRST logic of the two CPUs is
</I>&gt;<i>   compatible
</I>
Don't know anything about this.

However, the reset logic was recently reworked, so this is what is
happening:

1. srst is asserted
2. trst is asserted
3. jtag chain is enumerated and validated
4. targets can now assert reset. At this time this should be srst only.
5. reset is deasserted by targets
6. the targets are examined &amp; embedded ice registers set up

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  We'd only need JTAG to write to the internal Flash of the MSP430, no
</I>&gt;<i>  debugging support or similar. I wonder if there's anything
</I>&gt;<i>  intrinsically difficult in supporting the MSP430 in OpenOCD, or if
</I>&gt;<i>  it's considered reasonably easy, and that just nobody has bothered
</I>&gt;<i>  to do it yet.
</I>
If the flash in question is specific to the cpu, then there would be
msp specific
code inside the flash driver(which would only be used with msp cpu's).

Should be fine.

&gt;<i>  For the TRST/SRTS logic, I guess that's something we'll have to dig
</I>&gt;<i>  out of the data sheets by ourselves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  That leaves the multiple devices - and in particular CPUs - in the
</I>&gt;<i>  JTAG chain. Is this something that ought to work ?
</I>
Yes. You should be able to talk to the ARM CPU w/OpenOCD trunk,
but the MPS would need work.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Is there anything else that's likely to bite us ?
</I>
We're interested in seing support for non-ARM CPUs, so we'll follow your
progress closely. The OpenOCD architecture may well need tweaking,
but nothing major that I can think of.

Please post to this mailing list, I'm sure others are interested and
have advice to offer.
