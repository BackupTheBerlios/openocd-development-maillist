Yes. This idea crept into my head, as well.

One thing to consider is that most probably people whoa are willing to 
write scripts and use OpenOCD own some dexterity with C, as well. And 
that means that most of the problems may be solved if the API is defined 
clearly enough.

For example, I have been looking into the possibility of writing my own 
main program. This would involve:

- remove the gdb and telnet stuff (inits and loop)
- write whatever is being done in plain C

The downside of this approach is that if you know next to nothing about 
internals of OpenOCD (as I do), the learning curve is very steep. And 
then the command API has to be well defined, and it is not very quick to 
reverse engineer it from the way OpenOCD parses command line.

So, maybe this is just something we try to make too complicated. Maybe 
we really should have the statically linkable OpenOCD library, which has 
the same commands exposed as the telnet/gdb interface. 
Library+documentation+some simple examples woudl do the trick. Assuming, 
of course, that the API does not change too fast.
