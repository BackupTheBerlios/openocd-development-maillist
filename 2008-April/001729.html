That's not surprising. If you have the debug_level 3 output handy, I would
be much obliged, I've added some debug output.

Did you have the oportunity to try  srst_only as well?

The reason I'd like to see what happens (we have a dozen targets but not
one that exhibits the problem you are describing), is that a change
that I *did*
make was to *always* assert trst, which will erase the reset vector catch.

What the old code did was to effectively disable assertion of trst for the
case where target was running while the &quot;reset halt&quot; was issued. Making
assumptions about the current target state breaks power cycle +  reset.

</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt;  &gt; I've understood that some -S targets &quot;stop the jtag clk&quot; while srst

</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt;  &gt; the jtag circuitry is disconnected rather than the jtag clk being
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt;  &gt; stopped...
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt;  I'm not really familiar with the debug support on these CPUs, but I know
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt;  that according to the datasheets, on at least some LPC21xx and LPC24xx
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt; CPUs (with ARM7TDMI-S cores) they come up with the JTAG interface
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt; disabled and immediately start a boot loader in on-chip flash which
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt; enables the JTAG pins only if there is no &quot;Content Read Protection&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt; enabled (set by a bit in internal flash, read by the boot loader).
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt;  I don't know if the fact the JTAG pins come up disabled is a property of
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt;  the ARM7TDMI-S core specifically, or something NXP have done on the LPCs
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt; - it may well be the latter in this case.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; The arm926ejs that Dominic is working with shows evidence of failing to
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; communicate immediately after SRST is released. That would match what you
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; are describing above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Communicating IMMEDIATELY after releasing SRST is wrong, if the target
</I>&gt;<i>  specified a jtag_n[st]rst_delay. Is that what your patch does?
</I>
No change there, which is why I was puzzled.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  There are at least two factors that could delay a target's ability to
</I>&gt;<i>  communicate after a reset (either S or T reset, assuming that S affects the
</I>&gt;<i>  target's ability to communicate via JTAG):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - internal reset delays of the target
</I>&gt;<i>  - external reset delays caused by the board (e.g. power supervisor)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; What you are describing has a number of interesting aspects. I haven't
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; quite thought it through, but some things come to mind:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  This is something different. The LPCs come up with the JTAG pins ENABLED, no
</I>&gt;<i>  matter what the user's manual is trying to tell us. Very early in the
</I>&gt;<i>  internal boot ROM that's always executed first (except for devices with no
</I>&gt;<i>  flash, but on those devices CRP would be useless anyway), the JTAG pins are
</I>&gt;<i>  disabled by means of the PINSEL register (GPIO pin control). If CRP is NOT
</I>&gt;<i>  enabled, the JTAG pins will be re-enabled at some point, and control is
</I>&gt;<i>  transfered to the user application.
</I>
ROM or Flash? If this is in flash then the behavior of reset could very much
depend on what's stored in the flash.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I always assumed that SRST would stop the JTAG clock on (some) -S cores
</I>&gt;<i>  because the JTAG clock needs to be synchronized to the processor clock, hence
</I>&gt;<i>  if the processor clock stops, at least some implementations of that
</I>&gt;<i>  synchronizer circuit would stop the JTAG clock, too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; - We've seen lpc2148 being unresponsive to jtag chain validation(only 1's
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; returned). Perhaps some interfaces happen to assert/deassert srst during
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; startup and thus chain validation could work on some, but not other JTAG
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; devices. Perhaps srst should be asserted/deasserted before jtag chain
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; validation. What delay to use then?? If Dominic is seeing this problem,
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; then perhaps it needs to be &gt;1 second???
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  What should have caused your LPC to go through startup? The code might assert
</I>&gt;<i>  TRST (it probably should, if TRST is available), but any communication
</I>&gt;<i>  afterwards should be delayed by jtag_ntrst_delay. Assuming that delay is
</I>&gt;<i>  large enough to cover internal and external delays, communication should
</I>&gt;<i>  work.
</I>
An interface's implementation of the TRST an SRST could leave the pins floating
 or have transient values during intialisation. I'm thinking that openocd
should not only deassert trst/srst before validation, but also cycle
an assertion
of both pins(as approperiate based upon reset_config + nsrst/ntrst delays).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; - The jtag_add_reset() API does not define what happens when srst &amp;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; trst changes
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; at the same time. It could vary depending on the driver implementation.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; I was thinking about changing the high level jtag_add_reset() fn to define
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; what it means to change srst &amp; trst at the same time such that driver
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; differences no longer matter. I need to digest what you are writing and the
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; testing feedback before I could come up with a proposal though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  We could define that behaviour, but whatever we define might be wrong for a
</I>&gt;<i>  particular case. If a caller of jtag_add_reset requires a specific order IMHO
</I>&gt;<i>  the right thing would be to use two calls.
</I>
We could forbid calls that change both pins at the same time.

&gt;<i>  &gt; - today enumeration of the jtag chain happens *before* srst is asserted.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; This is broken if a CPU turns off the jtag interface or failed to enable
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  There's hardly anything we can do to enable a target's JTAG interface. If
</I>&gt;<i>  there's code executing on the target that disables JTAG it will likely have
</I>&gt;<i>  it disable by the time we get a chance to examine the chain, since we can't
</I>&gt;<i>  guarantee any timing between releasing reset and executing JTAG scans. Those
</I>&gt;<i>  devices that are problematic in that regard usually prevent debug out of
</I>&gt;<i>  reset as well.
</I>
I was thinking that early startup code *enabled* the jtag interface.
So asserting srst
and waiting would enable the interface.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; - since it may be necessary to assert srst before the jtag interface
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; is enabled, then
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; target initialization can't talk to the target during initialization
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; since reset can only
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; occur *after* target initialization. It would be nice to stop this
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; from happening anyway,
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; because it would remove one obstacle from launching the gdb &amp; telnet server
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; before the target has been initialized or the jtag chain has been verified
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Why should it be necessary to assert srst?
</I>
if the startup code enables the jtag interface, then asserting +
deasserting srst would
cause the jtag interface to be anbled.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; - perhaps jtag chain enumeration should happen during reset rather
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; than at startup?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  That would be broken in case of srst_pulls_trst (e.g. all LPCs).
</I>
I meant during target_process_reset() before asserting reset.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; - today there is a srst/trst delay which can be specified. Perhaps
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; this is a bit too
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; low level to handle the situation above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Not sure what you mean here.
</I>
If we need to assert/deassert srst &amp; let the startup code run to
enable the jtag interface, then that srst delay would not be
related to srst delays as such. Perhaps jtag_nsrst_delay is sufficient,
I'd think so, but I'm not sure.
