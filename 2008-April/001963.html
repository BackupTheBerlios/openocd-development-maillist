<PRE>&gt;<i> I see, but why would not you just use telnet?

</I>
Telnet is not a problem, there is netcat, and e.g. Python
has a decent socket interface. But if I am using the system 
from an external script I need to:

- start the daemon
- check the daemon stderr for error messages and watch out for
premature exit (and check the exit code)
- open the TCP socket (and be aware of the possibility of the
daemon not answering for whatever reason)
- talk to the daemon through TCP, do whatever I do
- if something goes wrong, kill the daemon (i.e. watch out for
stderr messages on unresponsive socket)
- tell the daemon to shut down through TCP
- wait for the daemon to shut down or kill it if it doesn't


The actual meat in here (do whatever is done) is exactly the
same regardless of the method. But with direct interaction
without the network in between there is only one process to
talk to. And that is exactly what all sorts of scripting tools
expect.

Of course, the next question is why I want to restart OpenOCD
every time. Because that seems to be the stable way of doing
things. I have had two problems:

- FT2232 drivers are not the most stable piece of software in
  the world, and sometimes they just get stuck

- sometimes OpenOCD is not able to stop or reset the target
  when instructed to do so, but the same target with the same
  software always stops when OpenOCD is started.

Both of these are easily solved by always reloading OpenOCD.


So, this is why. Sounds silly, but so it goes... Robustness is
the name of the game, and I'll happily get rid of every moving
part I do not need.

- Ville
