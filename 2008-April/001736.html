<PRE>&gt;<i> - We've seen lpc2148 being unresponsive to jtag chain validation(only 1's
</I>&gt;<i> returned). Perhaps some interfaces happen to assert/deassert srst during
</I>&gt;<i> startup and thus chain validation could work on some, but not other JTAG
</I>&gt;<i> devices. Perhaps srst should be asserted/deasserted before jtag chain
</I>&gt;<i> validation. What delay to use then?? If Dominic is seeing this problem,
</I>&gt;<i> then perhaps it needs to be &gt;1 second???
</I>
Hello &#216;yvind and Jonathan,

please see my previous post about LPC2148 behavior I have observed.
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2008-February/001018.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openocd-development/2008-February/001018.html</A>
There is a patch already applied, all what is needed is proper configuration script.
I suppose it is exactly that.

&gt;<i> - since it may be necessary to assert srst before the jtag interface
</I>&gt;<i> is enabled, then
</I>&gt;<i> target initialization can't talk to the target during initialization
</I>&gt;<i> since reset can only
</I>&gt;<i> occur *after* target initialization.
</I>
Actually, this is no longer true.
There is no need for having target initialized prior pulling SRST line.

&gt;<i> - perhaps jtag chain enumeration should happen during reset rather
</I>&gt;<i> than at startup?
</I>
This would prevent attach without reset, not a good idea.

Regards,
   Pavel
