Hello,

&gt;<i> The problem that I addressed below is that for targets with srst_only and

</I>
Which should not harm anything... srst_only, as I understand it defines that only SRTS is connected to the device.
If TRST is is floating in the air, it makes no harm. Anyway, this not the core of the question.


&gt;<i> Drivers track the state internally and when srst is asserted with
</I>&gt;<i> srst_pulls_trst,
</I>&gt;<i> then the driver needs to update the tracked state of the JTAG TAP controller
</I>&gt;<i> to TAP_TLR, which the bitbang &amp; ft drivers now do.
</I>
Actually, the driver needs not to do that, if such situation never occurs, see below.


&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; Do not assert trst in srst_only case even if srst_pulls_trst.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  &gt; This requires drivers to update their record of cur_state when srst is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> asserted.
</I>
Better to signal this to the driver (the need to update cur_state) somewhere in the
jtag reset command structure rather than let the driver deduce this (?).


&gt;&gt;<i>  From what I read in the code, my assumption is that if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  RESET_SRST_PULLS_TRST bit is set jtag_add reset _never_ enqueues command
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  with jtag_srst==1 and jtag_trst==0.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Correct. I don't think this happens with todays code.
</I>
Here we go... that is the core of the question, so the driver does not need
to check RESET_SRST_PULLS_TRST as such situation never really effectively happens, right?
What about defining the API so, rather than covering this impossible condition
in the driver?


&gt;<i> That would cause the clk to be driven while trst is asserted, that's an
</I>&gt;<i> unintended side effect during reset, which is not nice.
</I>
Misunderstanding: I meant signal the driver to reset cur_state to TLR here.
The current code requires driver to deduce this, which I consider unclean solution.


&gt;<i> The driver has to track the state of the tap controller and when the
</I>&gt;<i> srst is asserted for srst_pulls_trst, then the driver needs to update
</I>&gt;<i> the tracked state to TAP_TLR.
</I>
That is it - signal the driver to do this explicitly is probably better,
so that the driver does not need to check for srst_pulls_trst or whatever.
Sorry if my previous post was confusing in this.


&gt;&gt;<i>  By the way, jtag_add_reset asserts SRST first and then it moves to TLR
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> state by TMS (trst_with_tms)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  which is wrong for devices which stop JTAG clock when SRST is asserted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (!!).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  jtag_add_end_state(TAP_TLR) does not probably work in this case.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Should not this happen in opposite order?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm thinking that it looks like an increasingly good idea to forbid transition
</I>&gt;<i> of srst &amp; trst in the same jtag_add_reset() call.
</I>
Or even better: to split it to two API function jtag_add_srst and jtag_add_tlr (?).


Regards,
   Pavel
