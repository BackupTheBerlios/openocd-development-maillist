</I>Can you explain why it would fail?

I am not sure how auto-erase is implemented currently. I see two 
possibilities to do this right:
 - either only erase when a write operation spans the start of a sector. 
That way, further writes will not erase anything that was written 
before, if we write in ascending address order.
 - or: check for the old contents and only do an erase if any bit needs 
to be programmed from 0 to 1. That would also handle the already-erased 
case, but would introduce some overhead by reading the whole block 
first. Maybe this can be reduced to some kind of status flag for each 
sector.

I use the first method in our proprietary bootloader, and it works quite 
good, provided the user knows about this behaviour. It is definitely 
more useful than completely manual erase in the most common case during 
development - ie. writing a new code/data block to flash.
In the rare case where you may want to write modified data over a 
non-erased block, it can be turned off, but I still think the default 
should be for the most common case.

&gt;<i> User shall be aware wtah (s)he is doing.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>The user knows (s)he is going to write to flash, so changed bits in that 
sector are expected. I am not sure how many openocd/gdb users know about 
the internals of flash roms and about the need to erase sectors - 
anyway, this is just a matter of documenting the behaviour (and fixing 
it in case it is broken in some cases currently - writing from gdb 
should definitely only erase once).

&gt;<i> Second, some parts do feature erase before write on their own in the hardware,
</I>&gt;<i> thus auto_erase is of no use here, only the FLASH gets worn sooner.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Which parts are those? I have worked on many flash roms, but never came 
across a chip with that behaviour.
On such a device, the higher flash layer should know about that 
behaviour and not issue any erase commands - completely disabling 
auto-erase for this reason seems wrong to me.
