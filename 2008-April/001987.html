<PRE>Ville Voipio napsal(a):
&gt;<i> But even more interesting is the question that if the device only has a 
</I>&gt;<i> 128-octet buffer in it, why am I able to use 1024-octet writes? 
</I>&gt;<i> Shouldn't the device buffer overflow? Or is it so that most of the time 
</I>&gt;<i> libusb almost gets there in time, but is a bit slower than the device?
</I>
There is actually no problem in how much data you WRITE at a time,
USB handles this automatically, device sends NAK on the OUT endpoint when its buffer gets full
and the host computer reschedules the data delivery.
The problem is in that how many read back data the write induces.

Because the libusb is synchronous, it does not do read data from device until &quot;read&quot; function
is called. And it cannot be called until &quot;write&quot; function finishes its job, so the buffer
of IN endpoint (the device-&gt;computer one) gets overrun meanwhile.

Example: if an operation consisted of 7 output only commands and 1 read back command
inducing single octet to be sent back, there would be 1 octet placed to IN buffer for every
8 octets in the OUT buffer.
So if there were 1024 octets containing such operations sent to the device, the IN buffer would be
just full without any overrun and then it would be read out, no problem occurs.
However if there were just (and only) read back commands sent to the device, the IN buffer becomes full
right after 128 octects are written.

In other words, if the read back data queued in the device during write operation is not read by computer
the internal buffer of the device may overrun and data is lost (depends on application).
The write operation may be as large as we like, as long the read back data fit into the
internal buffer of the device.
FTD2XX drivers &quot;virtually enlarges&quot; this buffer by asynchronously reading data from the device in the background
and storing it in the buffer on computer (even during the write operation itself).

&gt;<i> I think this problem is something that should be asked from the libftdi 
</I>&gt;<i> developers. They might have some ideas. I'll do that.
</I>
I am pretty sure, that libftdi does not do background read.

Regards, Pavel
