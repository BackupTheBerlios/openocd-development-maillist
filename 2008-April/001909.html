</I>Yes, this should work, too.
The erase can be deferred until the first write to a sector, if the 
write operation keeps a map of which sectors it has erased/written 
already, so that nothing is erased that was already written - this 
should be not too difficult to implement.


&gt;<i> I just looked into the sources and found out, that flash_write() does

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So what is broken then?
</I>&gt;<i> If I read the sources correctly, it is exactly the case of two writes

</I>&gt;<i> but also in a single operation (!), if the image to be written 
</I>&gt;<i> contains non-consecutive sections
</I>&gt;<i> which fall into a single sector - I can easily imagine such situation.
</I>This would definitely require fixing to make auto_erase useful, but I 
think it would be worth the effort.

&gt;<i> Because of above I strongly recommend staying with auto_erase 
</I>&gt;<i> *disabled* by default,
</I>&gt;<i> as it has nasty pitfalls. The user may not know that the linker script 
</I>&gt;<i> has not aligned sections
</I>&gt;<i> to sector boundary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is hard to implement this the perfect way or at least without these 
</I>&gt;<i> unpleasant pitfalls
</I>&gt;<i> - until they are gone, please consider keeping it disabled by default.
</I>That is OK, but as soon as we have a good fix, I am in favour of turning 
the default back to on. I still think it *can* be done in a way that no 
unexpected behaviour occurs.
