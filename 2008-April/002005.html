Dear Ville,

Ville Voipio napsal(a):
&gt;<i> Regarding the checksum (or hash) of the data... I think simple
</I>&gt;<i> parity is too flimsy... There are several practical situations
</I>&gt;<i> where it will miss out an error. For example, you can reorder
</I>&gt;<i> the data as much as you want, or miss out two similar words.
</I>&gt;<i> (Practically speaking, 0xffffffff 0xffffffff gives the same
</I>&gt;<i> result os 0x00000000 0x00000000.)
</I>
Sad but true.
First of all, we need a check on correct number of words being
received by DCC download routine running on the target,
if this matches, it means everything went smooth.

&gt;<i> AFAIK, the download speed should remain at or below 50 kW/s.
</I>&gt;<i> This means that a 5 MHz core will have 100 cycles time to
</I>&gt;<i> do whatever it is going to do. That suffices even for the
</I>&gt;<i> real CRC32. (However, the tabular approach requires memory.)
</I>
CRC is not a good choice in that it requires memory, not only if tables are used,
I suppose the CRC routine would be larger than the download code itself as it is now.
As working area is used for this, which possibly need to be backed up, it adds overhead.

&gt;<i> hash = 0;
</I>&gt;<i> for each word w in input:
</I>&gt;<i>   *ptr++ = w;
</I>&gt;<i>   w ^= ptr;
</I>&gt;<i>   hash += w;
</I>&gt;<i>   hash = hash rol 1;
</I>
Looks simple enough to be implemented by a few instructions.

&gt;<i> - checksum is always rotated by one (to shuffle the bit positions)
</I>&gt;<i> - data is XORed with the pointer to give different input for similar
</I>&gt;<i>   data in different positions
</I>&gt;<i> - avoids the pitfalls of long zero runs
</I>
All goodies.

&gt;<i> - is weak as a hash, but very fast to calculate (two extra
</I>&gt;<i>   instruction to the DCC poll code; XOR and add-rotate)
</I>
Actually, I don't think this is a real concern - we do not need some extra strong hash,
the code size is much more important, two instructions is perfect ;-)

&gt;<i> or memory-consuming when done in software. One of the fastest non-CRC
</I>&gt;<i> hashes is Adler-32 (used in, e.g., zlib):
</I>
Actually, the code looks still pretty long.

&gt;<i> I know this discussion sounds a bit academic, but as I need to use the
</I>&gt;<i> systems on the factory-floor, I really do not want to have a
</I>&gt;<i> single bit wrong. (Currently, I use CRC16 calculated after the transfer.)
</I>
This is ok ;-)
Well, data upload to RAM is typically a development, not a production
thing, so eve basic check preventing just data overrun (which is the
most critical thing here) would be fine.
In case of programming flash memory, it is good to have some stronger check
afterwards, but this is rather task for a flash driver.

&gt;<i> If the hash calculation is done after the transfer, then both Adler
</I>&gt;<i> and FNV are smaller and faster than CRC32.
</I>
Either the code has to be uploaded along with the DCC downloader, which eats memory,
or afterwards, which adds a communication turnaround, which is exactly what fast writes
try to avoid.

I think simple checksum, as you proposed at the beginning is fine,
but first step would be to check at least number of words transferred.

Best regards,
   Pavel
