<PRE>&gt;<i> - we're also not sure if the TRST/SRST logic of the two CPUs is
</I>&gt;<i>   compatible
</I>
Do you need the TRST/SRST at all? If the MSP430 supports JTAG properly, 
its TAP should be resettable by TMS/TDI/TDO/TCK only. Then you might be 
able to hit the processor with a sledgehammer by using JTAG instructions 
only. (This works with ARMs most of the time.)

&gt;<i> We'd only need JTAG to write to the internal Flash of the MSP430, no
</I>&gt;<i> debugging support or similar. I wonder if there's anything
</I>&gt;<i> intrinsically difficult in supporting the MSP430 in OpenOCD, or if
</I>&gt;<i> it's considered reasonably easy, and that just nobody has bothered
</I>&gt;<i> to do it yet.
</I>
Would it be possible to create a SVF file for the MSP430? (This works 
with Atmel AVRs with JTAG.) Then you'd have a standard programming file, 
and you could use any SVF-aware JTAG tool to pour it into the processor 
(UrJTAG, for example).

Whether or not this works depends a lot on MSP430's programming 
algorithm. If it is a simple one, then creating a SVF file would not be 
a large obstacle (SVF file is essentially a collection of simple JTAG 
commands). However, if the algorithm relies heavily on polling 
something, then things are more difficult as there is no conditional 
execution in SVF. Usually SVF files are a bit slower to execute as they 
need to use fixed worst-case delays.

Bad news is that OpenOCD does not support SVF, only XSVF. On the other 
hand, XSVF files can be made in a straightforward manner. SVF would be 
more standard, though.

I think you have two options:

1. Find standard tools to create a SVF file, and make SVF support for 
OpenOCD.

2. Write tools to create a XSVF file for MSP430 programming and use 
trunk OpenOCD to program it.


If you choose #1, I have a SVF parser written in plain C. It should be 
rather straightforward to integrate it into OpenOCD, but I haven't had 
the time.

Anyway, start by looking at the programming algorithm. If it can be done 
without polling, SVF/XSVF is something you might want to consider seriously.

Just my 2p.

- Ville
