<PRE>Hi list,

I've spent some time investigating this issue.

&#216;yvind is right that the order in which TRST and SRST get asserted DOES matter:

Open On-Chip Debugger
&gt;<i> endstate rti
</I>current endstate: tlr

*since when is the endstate output broken?!*

&gt;<i> irscan 0 0xe
</I>&gt;<i> var id 32
</I>&gt;<i> drscan 0 id
</I>&gt;<i> jtag_reset 0 1
</I>&gt;<i> jtag_reset 1 1
</I>&gt;<i> jtag_reset 0 1
</I>&gt;<i> jtag_reset 0 0
</I>&gt;<i> irscan 0 0xe
</I>value captured during scan didn't pass the requested check: captured: 0x0f check_value: 0x01 check_mask: 0x0f
in_handler reported a failed check
&gt;<i> shut
</I>
After both resets were released, the OpenOCD thought the TAP would be in T-L-R,
when it really was still in R-T/I. Setting the JTAG instruction failed, because
the OpenOCD and the TAP were out of sync.

I don't *believe* there's anything that mysteriously &quot;disconnects&quot; the JTAG
pins, but rather that the AT91SAM9260's nTRST operates synchronous to either
MCLK or TCK.
Either way, the effect is the same - while nSRST is held low, the JTAG
controller is completely inaccessible, and that includes TAP resets.

Also, the current code (R544/5) is broken:

------- snip -------
int arm7_9_assert_reset(target_t *target)
{
[...]
    if ((target-&gt;reset_mode == RESET_HALT) || (target-&gt;reset_mode == RESET_INIT))
    {
        /*
         * Some targets do not support communication while SRST is asserted. We need to
         * set up the reset vector catch here.
         *
         * If TRST is asserted, then these settings will be reset anyway, so setting them
         * here is harmless.
         */
[...]
    }

    /* we can't know what state the target is in as we might e.g.
     * be resetting after a power dropout, so we need to issue a tms/srst
     */

    /* assert SRST and TRST */
    /* system would get ouf sync if we didn't reset test-logic, too */
    jtag_add_reset(1, 1);
------- snip -------

Asserting TRST is wrong here (let's assume it did what it /should/ do,
i.e. ignore the assertion order for now), because that would reset the content
of the EmbeddedICE registers. I don't quite get why TRST needs to be asserted
unconditionally.
Ideally, it should only be asserted once, when the OpenOCD first connects.
It could further be asserted in case the OpenOCD got out of sync, or when
there's a chance of loosing sync as is the case with ARM7TDMI-S and
reset-while-halted.
Are power outages during debug really that much of a problem?

There's also a potential problem with multiple targets in a chain that is the
result of removing prepare_reset_halt:

- Reset first target:
  o program halt condition
  o assert reset

- Reset second target:
  o program hald condition &lt;- this could fail, because SRST is already asserted
  o assert reset

Best regards,

Dominic
