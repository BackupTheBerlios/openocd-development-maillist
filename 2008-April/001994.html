The difference is that the user has to get and recompile openocd to add support 
for a varient on a device - if it is in configuration files then just add the 
files into an existing built. There are a lot of openocd binary builds out there 
and it looks like board vendors are including their own varients - having this 
stuff data driven makes that situation more managable IMHO.

Having just waded through a pile of forum postings the majority of which are 
building and configuring openocd to match how the vendor pre-built an older 
version on linux, win32, etc setups it seemed like something worth considering; 
however I'm in no rush to do that given that I have no problems with compiling 
openocd myself so for me at least I do also agree .c and .cfg make little 
difference.

Tim.
