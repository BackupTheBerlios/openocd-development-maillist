<PRE>Hi,

I am proposing a scheme for testing that I suppose is more rigorous than 
the existing one and has a lot more potential to catch regression 
failures as well as it provides a way to describe tests that certain  
(ideally all) functionalities should pass.
This is how I see it working:
* the attached document is a collection of test cases, collection that 
is and *must* be expanded (ideally to a maximal set). This particular  
document is just a small set of tests that should be done, I'm working 
on it...
* this file defines what tests should be run, and it constitutes only a 
&quot;template&quot; for actual testing. The tester should copy this file and fill 
it with proper values
* a test case is uniquely identified by an ID. Running the test case for 
a particular system (JTAG interface, target) using a revision is called 
testing. All the distinctive elements of a test run should be filled in 
the places defined by the template. For now, the revision # is written 
for an entire test set. A test case can either PASS or FAIL. Fuzzy 
values are not accepted. This set of organized data constitutes a record 
of testing.
* one or more test cases describe a functionality. Ideally, each 
functionality should be covered, but for now we should reach for a &quot;good 
coverage&quot; compromise.
* a bug report should contain the test case that didn't pass or should 
describe a new test case.
* because the number of possible combinations is pretty big, I propose 
having distinct documents for each target and each interface (extend the 
testing/examples/ with the result of testing for different interfaces).
* on major releases, testing should be done on maximal set of 
combinations. Deliverables should be stored along with the records of 
testing, so the user can check what functionalities are available *and 
tested*.
* this procedure does not describe the way testing is done, eg. there 
should be room for creating automatic tools for testing, tests can be 
run issuing commands on the telnet interface as well as running scripts 
available in OpenOCD, but manual testing seems to be the solution for 
the moment.

Please fire up all the arguments and the ideas, as all this is perfectible.

Regards,
Edgar
