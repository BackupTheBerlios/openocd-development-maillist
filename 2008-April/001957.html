<PRE>&gt;<i> I've been pondering adding Jim Tcl support to OpenOCD.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I really don't like the idea of OpenOCD trying define yet another
</I>&gt;<i> scripting language.
</I>
Me neither. There are enough of those.

&gt;<i> Any thoughts on Tcl?
</I>
Very nice, but...

By a simple modification OpenOCD would be straightforward to use with 
Tcl (expect), Python (pexpect), or any other scripting tool.

I do see the advantage of having an integrated interpreter (Jim Tcl), 
but then again, I do not see too many disadvantages of having an 
external interpreter. An integrated interpreter would have a smaller 
total footprint, but people using OpenOCD on embedded targets may want 
to roll their own anyway.

The only thing really missing right now is something as simple as a 
non-daemon version with stdin, stdout and stderr. That would enable the 
simple use of any external scripting. With the daemon-based architecture 
there are too many extra hoops to jump through.

So, a command line (or config file, make your pick) switch --nodaemon to 
use the thing on console would be highly useful in scripting. I haven't 
had the time to see how that would be achieved, but it doesn't sound too 
difficult, does it? Daemons are usually useful, but in this specific 
application the daemon is only an extra layer of complication.

I admit that Jim Tcl would be fancy, but I am not sure if the effort vs. 
time ratio is very good in implementing it. But that is just my opinion.
