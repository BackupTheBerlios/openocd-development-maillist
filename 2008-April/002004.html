<PRE>Pavel,

Regarding the checksum (or hash) of the data... I think simple 
parity is too flimsy... There are several practical situations 
where it will miss out an error. For example, you can reorder 
the data as much as you want, or miss out two similar words.
(Practically speaking, 0xffffffff 0xffffffff gives the same
result os 0x00000000 0x00000000.)

There are two strategies. The best one is to calculate the
hash (checksum, CRC) on the fly. That requires there to be
a sufficient amount of processing cycles available. If there
isn't time, then the only solution is to calculate the
hash afterwards.

AFAIK, the download speed should remain at or below 50 kW/s.
This means that a 5 MHz core will have 100 cycles time to
do whatever it is going to do. That suffices even for the
real CRC32. (However, the tabular approach requires memory.)

I am not a specialist in cryptography, so any of the stuff below
may be horrendously wrong. And I am not a specialist in ARM
assembler, either, so I leave the optimization part to other 
people.


A quick-and-dirty approach:

hash = 0;
for each word w in input:
  *ptr++ = w;
  w ^= ptr;
  hash += w;
  hash = hash rol 1;

- checksum is always rotated by one (to shuffle the bit positions)
- data is XORed with the pointer to give different input for similar
  data in different positions
- avoids the pitfalls of long zero runs
- is weak as a hash, but very fast to calculate (two extra
  instruction to the DCC poll code; XOR and add-rotate)



There are some real hash functions which are rather fast to calculate
in a limited space. CRC32 is a bad one, as the shift-register
implementations are nice and fast done bitwise in hardware but slow
or memory-consuming when done in software. One of the fastest non-CRC
hashes is Adler-32 (used in, e.g., zlib):


uint8_t *ptr;

a = 1
b = 0

for each word w in input:
  *(uint32_t *)ptr = w;
  a += *ptr++;
  b += a;
  a += *ptr++;
  b += a;
  a += *ptr++;
  b += a;
  a += *ptr++;
  b += a;
  if (a &gt;= 65521)
    a -= 65521;
  if (b &gt;= 4 * 65521)
    b -= 4 * 65521;

while (b &gt;= 65521)
  b -= 65521;

hash = (a &lt;&lt; 16) + (b &amp; 0xffff);


- basic operation for each octet:
   a += new data; (in modulo 65521)
   b += a; (in modulo 65521)

- the pointer operations may be better done by rotating data in a 
  register, any method to get the data octet-by-octet is fine
  (e.g., and-rotate).


As practically all ARMs seem to have a multiplication unit, then 
we might think of using something that multiplies. 32-bit FNV-1a
might fit the bill:


uint8_t *ptr;

hash = 2166136261;
for each word w in input
  *(uint32_t *)ptr = w;
  hash *= 0x01000193;
  hash ^= *ptr++;
  hash *= 0x01000193;
  hash ^= *ptr++;
  hash *= 0x01000193;
  hash ^= *ptr++;
  hash *= 0x01000193;
  hash ^= *ptr++;

- should be a good hash (high dispersion, etc.)
- same thing as with Adler; octet-by-octet
- extremely small if done afterwards to the data


IMHO, FNV is way cooler than Adler, but their real figure of 
merit is the number of cycles. I think they should be written 
in assembly and then the number of cycles should be compared. 
My guess is that with Cortex FNV is faster, with ARM7TDMI Adler 
may be slightly faster.

---

I know this discussion sounds a bit academic, but as I need to use the
systems on the factory-floor, I really do not want to have a
single bit wrong. (Currently, I use CRC16 calculated after the transfer.)

If the hash calculation is done after the transfer, then both Adler
and FNV are smaller and faster than CRC32.
