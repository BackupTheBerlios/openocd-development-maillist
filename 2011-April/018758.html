Strongly recommend buy a known working JTAG adapter. There are some
really affordable ones that work with OpenOCD.


&gt;<i> All signals are generated good.
</I>
Did you also look at signalling beyond the electrical level? Is your
JTAG adapter actually generating correct JTAG signalling? Are timings
accurate, and sequences correct? (Probably not.)


&gt;<i> But I don't know the source of my problems. When connect the target

</I>
Please start by using git source.


&gt;<i> The parallelport was modify to work over USB connection.
</I>
This is obviously not the best approach. If you must, and if you are
confident that the JTAG adapter works, then create a new driver for
it in OpenOCD.


&gt;<i> In the attached file are the modified version of the parport.c.
</I>
This is very unhelpful, for a couple of reasons. It is unlikely that
any single person knows exactly how the parport.c driver worked and
how it was implemented, especially in the 0.4.0 release which is old.
It is guaranteed that noone will comment or even bother to look at
the file you attached.

A better approach would be to email a diff between the original file
and your modified version, which would show only what you have
changed, and increase the chance that someone will take time to read
the code, because when only changes are shown there is a chance to
understand if and how your changes affect the driver.

The very best approach is that you add a driver for your adapter, and
make sure to add it into the current git source for the project. If
you create a nice and clean patch then it will be included into
OpenOCD immediately.


&gt;<i> Some one can helpme?
</I>
You have too many unknowns.

Get a known working JTAG adapter if you want to isolate how OpenOCD
works with your target board.

Get a known working target board if you want to isolate how your JTAG
adapter works.

In all circumstances use a known working OpenOCD version; the latest
code from git.
