That's odd.  I've never experienced this.  I'm a little behind the latest in
git.  Recently introduced bug in gdb server code?  In gdb?

BTW, be careful using openocd through telnet while gdb is connected.  Openocd
assumes exclusive use of one or the other, and does things like clear all
existing breakpoints when gdb connects.  It could be confusing the issue for you.


&gt;<i> 2. Breakpoints don't work.  I can set one in either the telnet client
</I>&gt;<i> or gdb without any error message.  But when I continue execution, the
</I>&gt;<i> program never halts at the breakpoint.
</I>

Have you tried hardware breakpoints as well?  In the past there have been
cache-related problems with software breakpoints on some less mature
architectures, though I can't speak for arm7_9.  And of course sw breakpoints
can't be used in some circumstances; e.g. code running from ROM or not currently
mapped into virtual memory (e.g. Linux kernel modules).  You should be able to
verify that the software breakpoint was succesfully inserted by doing a 'mdw' or
'arm disassemble' at the breakpoint address and seeing if the original
instruction was replaced with the bkpt instruction.

Hope this helps,
Mike
