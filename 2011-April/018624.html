<PRE>Excerpts from Peter Stuge's message of Sun Apr 03 13:24:39 +0100 2011:
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Your implementation seems extremely dangerous to me. You add a global
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; buffer, which will get corrupted if more than one device is being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; used. Is there a &quot;contract&quot; from openocd core that there will never
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; be more than one instance of a hardware driver? If so this method
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; would be safe, but is still pretty ugly. Is there an instance struct
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that could be used instead?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I simply extended what already existed, using 1 uint8_t as an output
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; buffer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Big difference. The output data was previously being passed as
</I>&gt;<i> parameter to the output function, ie. it was not global.
</I>Either way, this is a common approach in the drivers, take a look at
src/jtag/drivers/arm-jtag-ew.c which implements global buffers for the
USB pipe.

The code can of course be extended to support this, but ..

&gt;<i> &gt; Surely the fact they would have the same vid/pid combination would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ensure only the first adapter would ever be used?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Every device should have a serial number, allowing two to be
</I>&gt;<i> distinguished easily. Clones probably do not, but even then they can
</I>&gt;<i> be distinguished by which USB port they are connected to.
</I>I see nothing in the code to check for anything other than a matching
vid/pid combination, which automatically limits it to just 1 device.

&gt;<i> &gt; I am not aware of any instance structs for this purpose in openocd.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe someone else on list knows?
</I>No comments as of yet...

Attached are 2 rebased/tidied patches for the 2 features.
First implements LED support within the old code.
Second implements buffering, and updates all of the writes to use the
buffering.
Are these ok now? As you can probably tell, I am not experienced with
cooperating with other people in projects.
