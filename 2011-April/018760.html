<PRE>Hi Peter,
You're right on all points. But....
In my country I can't buy a jtag adapter (and I don't have money to buy 
in other country) I think is cheaper do a jtag wiggler2 port to usb and 
I have all parts to do this.
I'm using a Osciloscope to meter electronic signals ... and look good, 
but I'm not a specialist in the jtag signals.
About the file and the driver, I answer to the list about wath is the 
right way to add new drivers and I don't have any answer. I just using 
the modified version of parport.c to test, nothing else.
If I can make this work, the next step is make a driver and send it to 
the community. (maybe can help someone)
Thank's for your answer and time.

Sergio
