Sounds good. I like that approach a lot.


&gt;<i> &gt; Your implementation seems extremely dangerous to me. You add a global
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; buffer, which will get corrupted if more than one device is being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; used. Is there a &quot;contract&quot; from openocd core that there will never
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be more than one instance of a hardware driver? If so this method
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be safe, but is still pretty ugly. Is there an instance struct
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that could be used instead?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I simply extended what already existed, using 1 uint8_t as an output
</I>&gt;<i> buffer.
</I>
Big difference. The output data was previously being passed as
parameter to the output function, ie. it was not global.


&gt;<i> Do people have more than 1 of the same adapter to be connected via
</I>&gt;<i> the same instance of openocd?
</I>
Even if they do not, why should the code be limiting this? Unless the
assumption is made throughout openocd I don't think it's OK in the
driver.


&gt;<i> Surely the fact they would have the same vid/pid combination would
</I>&gt;<i> ensure only the first adapter would ever be used?
</I>
Every device should have a serial number, allowing two to be
distinguished easily. Clones probably do not, but even then they can
be distinguished by which USB port they are connected to.


&gt;<i> I am not aware of any instance structs for this purpose in openocd.
</I>
Maybe someone else on list knows?
