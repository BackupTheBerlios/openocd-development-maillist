<PRE>Hi all,
based on EJTAG spec, can somebody explain the difference between
FASTDATA competition and not competition modes :

During a Fastdata access, the Fastdata register value shifted in
specifies whether the Fastdata
access should be completed or not. The value shifted out is a flag
that indicates whether the Fastdata access was
successful or not (if completion was requested).

Shifting in a zero value requests completion of the
Fastdata access. The PrAcc bit in the EJTAG Control
register is overwritten with zero when the access
succeeds. (The access succeeds if PrAcc is one and
the operation address is in the legal dmseg segment
Fastdata area.) When successful, a one is shifted out.
Shifting out a zero indicates a Fastdata access failure.
Shifting in a one does not complete the Fastdata
access and the PrAcc bit is unchanged. Shifting out a
one indicates that the access would have been
successful if allowed to complete and a zero indicates
the access would not have successfully completed.


So my questions are :
1) If we demand completion, when do we do shift-out of the SPrAcc bit
to check status :
a) We shift in SPrAcc, we shift it out, we check it if it is &quot;1&quot; -
that would say &quot;You can send in data it will pass OK&quot;, and then
we shift in data or
b) We shift in SPrAcc, we shift in data, we shift out SPrAcc and check
if if it is &quot;1&quot; - in this case check comes after data shift-in and it
would say something like &quot;Data shifted in were well written&quot; ?

Based on this :

During Fastdata uploads and downloads, the processor will stall on
accesses to the Fastdata area. The PrAcc (processor
access pending bit) will be 1 indicating the probe is required to
complete the access. Both upload and download accesses
are attempted by shifting in a zero SPrAcc value (to request access
completion) and shifting out SPrAcc to see if the
attempt will be successful (i.e., there was an access pending and a
legal Fastdata area address was used). Downloads will
also shift in the data to be used to satisfy the load from the dmseg
segment Fastdata area, while uploads will shift out the
data being stored to the dmseg segment Fastdata area.

I would say that it is case b) - pre-check SPrAcc and then shift-in
data... But I am not sure. I do not know at which point to check.

BR,
Drasko
