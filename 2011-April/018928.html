Probably would be easier to debug this by seeing if the openocd gdb server is
getting the appropriate message from gdb when you hit ^c.  Don't know too much
about this code myself.

</I>
If that's the only hw bp you set, then the messages seem contradictory.  Maybe
someone with knowledge of openocd code for this arch can help.

&gt;&gt;<i> You should be able to verify that the software breakpoint was

</I>&gt;<i> It all seems OK:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think it must still be executing the unmodified instruction out of

</I>
Yes, 'should' being the operative word.  If you're sure that the execution path
passes through this instruction, then yes, icache not being flushed is the
likely explanation.  I had to fix the same problem on xscale a while back.  Not
sure of the status on arm7_9.  Again, maybe someone knowledgeable can chime in. 
Wish I could help more.  Maybe one day I'll graduate past armv5 :-)
