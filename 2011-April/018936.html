Awesome!

Hmmm.  I thought polling is done periodically while the the processor is
executing.  At least that's how I remember it for xscale.  I see that there's a
'poll' command to enable/disable this, but I never had to mess with it.  Maybe
on this arch it's off by default for some reason?

Sounds like support for this arch might be a bit rough around the edges.  I'm
sure that patches would be gratefully received :-)  Being able to set
breakpoints is kinda fundamental, and would be a huge contribution.
