The ULINK consists of the EZ-USB microcontroller, an SRAM, an EEPROM and
level shifters. There's even a schematic floating around the net:
<A HREF="http://www.mikrocontroller.net/attachment/51828/ULink.pdf">http://www.mikrocontroller.net/attachment/51828/ULink.pdf</A>

Keil is just using the digital I/O of the EZ-USB to read/write the JTAG
signals, quite simple actually.

Exactly. I have designed my own protocol and implemented it in my custom
firmware. I've also written a demo program in C++ that can erase/program
flash, read/write fuses, ... in various Atmel AVR (8-bit) devices with
my ULINK firmware.

&gt;<i> However, if his own firmware needs to be linked against a proprietary

</I>&gt;<i> firmware binary can not be included in/with OpenOCD.

Currently, this is the case. I'll look into alternatives.

&gt;<i> However, if the ULINK is basically an EZ-USB chip which downloads its

</I>&gt;<i> adapter is powered on.
</I>
Upon power-up, the &quot;blank&quot; EZ-USB chip registers itself with a VID/PID
it reads from the EEPROM on the ULINK board. Then, it can at any time be
loaded with the firmware program via standard USB control requests, so
at no point in time Keil's ULINK protocol needs to be used.

That is what I'm trying to achieve :)

Best regards,
