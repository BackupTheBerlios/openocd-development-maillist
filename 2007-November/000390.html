<PRE>One of the things that is the most confusing with OpenOCD is the whole
reset story. Not a big surprise, reset is necessarily complex.

However, here are some thoughts on how to make OpenOCD less
confusing:

- retire &quot;reset init&quot;. This command is not suitable for being used
from a script as it is asynchronous. In a script a better choice would
be &quot;reset halt&quot;, &quot;wait_halt&quot; and then execute a init script. Typically
this can be done from within a GDB startup script, using the &quot;monitor&quot;
prefix to GDB commands. The nasty thing about &quot;reset init&quot; is that
it will kinda work if the halt happens quickly. This results in
&quot;flaky&quot; OpenOCD behaviour. Having the &quot;reset init&quot; in the syntax sets
users off on the wrong path more likely than not.
- make &quot;reset halt&quot; synchronous. I.e. it should have a built in wait_halt
w/timeout. If at all possible, I'd like a hardwired timeout here. Does this
really need to be configurable? The users *do* have the source for OpenOCD
if something extraordinary is going on. Necessary configuration
options are fine, but lots of unecessary configuration options does
not give OpenOCD a very finished and polished impression.
- &quot;reset&quot; without argument *ALWAYS* does a &quot;reset run&quot;. This avoids
tying the reset command into the the target configuration, which is
another source of confusion.
- retire the &quot;reset_xxx&quot; argument to the target command.
- retire &quot;reset run_and_init&quot;
- retire &quot;reset run_and_halt&quot;
- add reset verification. This is something that I have been told
is needed, but I'm not 100% clear on what this entails. Basically
I understand that OpenOCD can check if something is asserting
reset other than OpenOCD. The fact that &quot;reset halt&quot; is synchronous
now becomes part of the reset verfication.


The general idea here is that reducing the amount of configuration
and the number of interdependencies will make OpenOCD easier
to use. Also, I'd the above pulls the commands in the direction of
being more scripting friendly.
