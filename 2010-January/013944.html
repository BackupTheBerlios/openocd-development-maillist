<PRE>Hey all,

I got tired of not having file and command completion, so I took a whack at
implementing it.  I was also missing the ability to use my home and end keys.  
At any rate, this patch series introduces this capability.  I'm not sure on the
memory leaks (since I'm doing tons of mallocs), but valgrind informs me that 
there may be some strings made via strdup's that might be leaking out.  Don't
know how though.

Anyways, the first patch brings in home and end key support.  This doesn't 
introduce much other than some more handlers for non-printable keys.  I haven't
run into anything with my testing.

The second patch brings in directory/file completion when the tab key is pressed.
If there are more than one option, hitting tab will list the possible options.
This also supports command completion including sub-commands.  Hitting tab to 
list sub-commands isn't working real well yet, specifically when a user has not
entered any characters, but I haven't thought of a good way to do it.

In summary, I'm posting this series to get some feedback so post-0.4.  If you 
want to pull from <A HREF="http://repo.or.cz/r/openocd/dnglaze.git">http://repo.or.cz/r/openocd/dnglaze.git</A> under the telnet 
branch, it's updated against the most current OpenOCD head.  Any feedback will 
be appreciated!
