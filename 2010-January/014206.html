Mostly because the relevant patterns for switching between SWD
and JTAG modes are on the order of

	50+ all-ones bits
	16-bit pattern
	50+ all-ones bits

So while it's easy to express that in terms of bytes and be obviously
correct, using 32-bit numbers is pretty unnatural.

Plus, notice the second patch ... that &quot;cable helper&quot; library thing
has always worked with a single 8-bit byte, not 32-bit integers.


&gt;<i> There is no 
</I>&gt;<i> big/small endian issue here, lsb is shifted out first.
</I>
I'm not sure what you mean by that.  The reason there's no endianness
issue is that it's specified in the interface as a simple bit array,
using little endian encoding.  Using 32-bit words would be a way to
introduce endianness issues, not remove them...


&gt;<i> The only reason I mention this is because I'd like to see the rest of
</I>&gt;<i> the jtag api move away from 8 bit vectors to something more sensible
</I>&gt;<i> (32 really).
</I>
I suppose I'm still thinking in terms of straight bit vectors being
the most natural interchange format for such stuff ... byte pointer
with count-of-bits.

The originator of a bit vector is of course free to align it however
they like.  And it might be reasonable to require that the pointer be
aligned to some boundary.

Plus, I didn't want to couple this interface to needing a rewrite of
the entire JTAG layer bit vector interface ... ;)
