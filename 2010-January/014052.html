The issue is that the previous code had a dangerous interface bug,
whereby it implicitly trashed data it was told to leave alone.

Adding a &quot;pad&quot; option gives that &quot;ability&quot; without the bug.  IME,
leaving interface bugs like that is a really bad thing to do.  So
the way out of that particular mess seems to be adding the option,
so those few folk who need that &quot;ability&quot; can invoke it as needed.
(And yours is the only complaint I've heard, FWIW.)

This is an example of why interface bugs are particularly bad:
leaving them alone is dangerous, but someone will have ended up
relying on the broken interface.  Hence the rule of thumb that
they need to be fixed ASAP, to avoid prolonging the pain.

The patch is easy; I'll likely send it around in the next day
or two.

Sounds fair enough to me; for &quot;after reset&quot; I'd might instead
say &quot;in examine()&quot;.  Would that be warn-once thing, or would
it pop up after every reset?

</I>
Could you elaborate on what &quot;contrived&quot; would be?  My current
understanding is that it would involve talking to code that's
running in a target CPU that's running MUCH slower than TCK.
(Or maybe is doing too much work-per-word.)

But ... I'm not sure I see how such configs could exist with
the current downloaded algorithms and cores.  Since ARM likes
to keep TCK at something like a sixth or an eight of the CPU
clock speed, and none of the algorithms in the current tree
are doing many instructions between DCC reads.  That means
that if we're talking JTAG, and using DCC just to speed up a
download, we're almost automatically OK.
