I have no problems doing this.  I'm kicking of a little side project in PHP
here shortly and have gone through some of the Trac setup again :).


&gt;<i> What would you describe as features that we should be particularly

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Tickets, tickets, and more tickets.  My biggest complaint with OpenOCD is
how bugs are tracked.  It's great that we have a little file and this
mailing list to quasi-manage things, but it's quite nice to also have a
ticket database.  That way, we can attach tickets and enhancements to
certain milestones, aka releases, so that there can be a better management
of when a release should occur.  You also gain the positive of a wiki where
different things for development can be documented.

Another important feature has to do with hooks that look at commit messages
for ticket numbers.  These essentially can close/update tickets based on
commit messages.  When I went to look at the git plug-in for Trac, they have
the python scripts for doing the post-receive-hook which would deal with
updating tickets.


&gt;<i> &gt; Do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you have this working with the OpenOCD git repository on SF?  There is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; plug-in for git support in Trac, but I've never used it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I say, it's a &quot;turn it on&quot; sort of thing, at first.  We have
</I>&gt;<i> not (yet?) turned it on.  Once it's enabled, I think there is
</I>&gt;<i> some simple config knob involved with the git hookup.  Then some
</I>&gt;<i> access control policies to arrange.  I understand that the
</I>&gt;<i> SourceForge folk have provided the generic parts of the hookup.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If there's no significant &quot;anti-&quot; sentiment by, oh, early next
</I>&gt;<i> week, I suspect the thing to do will be to turn it on and set
</I>&gt;<i> it up.  I'd seed it with my own current list, to start things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The only significant &quot;anti-&quot; sentiment I have is that the Trac git plug-in
hasn't had an update since 28th of August of 2009.  I'm going to play with
this a little bit with my sourceforge project that's hooked up to git and
I'll get back to you.
