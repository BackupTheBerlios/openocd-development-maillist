You don't need to use &quot;git&quot; to create usable patches.  If
two trees are clean,

	diff -NaurP tree1 tree2

will generate a better patch.  (And if they're not clean,
it's mostly a case of trimming down the &quot;diff&quot; output... or
coming up with a decent list of exclusions.)


&gt;<i> Isn't it possible that you apply the changes with simple &quot;patch -p1 &lt;
</I>&gt;<i> filname.patch&quot; on your working copy,
</I>
Make that &quot;patch -p2&quot; ... that's the first problem!  Needing &quot;p2&quot;
is unusual; &quot;p1&quot; is widespread, &quot;p0&quot; less so.

Also, non-unified diff syntax causes confusion.


Comments on the new config files:

 - Don't bother parameterizing the ETM TAP ID; ARM fixes that ID.
   But name it right:  that's an *ETB* TAP, not one for an ETM.

 - Why those &quot;force an error...&quot; comments when you're not actually
   forcing any error???  Are those TAP IDs wrong?

 - Don't bother passing &quot;-ircapture 0x1 -irmask 0xf&quot;, that just
   means &quot;use the defaults&quot;, which can be left unsaid.

 - There is no &quot;-variant arm926ejs&quot;.

 - Don't make an lpc3250 target config depend on a particular
   JTAG adapter for one board (Hitex stick) using it!!

 - Your &quot;reset-start&quot; event is mostly &quot;reset-init&quot; stuff.  Split
   it in two parts ... reset-init is board-specific.

 - There should be a real &quot;reset-start&quot; handler, in the target
   file, setting up for the 32KHz reset clock ... see the User's
   guide, there's an example of how to set that up.  If you make
   the &quot;reset init&quot; handler update clocking, it can also turn on
   a faster JTAG clock.

And you should also hook up the ETM and ETB; &quot;ti_dm355.cfg&quot;
gives one example of how to do that, maybe you can copy/paste.
Even if it doesn't work so well yet, One Day It Will.  :)

- Dave


&gt;<i> then make a diff or commit it? The 
</I>&gt;<i> lpc3180.c has the only file what has changed and 3 new files are added.
