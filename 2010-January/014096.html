So it's not a regression.  That means we won't hold the release until
that problem is fixed ... if we had a safe fix it'd likely merge though.

Which clock, precisely?  There are often a dozen or more on a SoC ...


&gt;<i>  I start at 72Mhz, does the debugger switch the speed to a lower one?

The debugger as a whole, certainly not ... it has no reason to, or any
knowledge about how to tweak the oscillator and PLL controls.

But at least some flash drivers will tweak clocks so they don't break
write timing requirements.  Maybe your driver is doing that wrong, or
you're telling it the wrong things.
