That'd be good.  If anything isn't yet suitable for merging
(given that the 0.4.0-RC phase is nearing its end), please
split that out separately.

I think it was Nico who had a bunch of Thumb stepping fixes.
The quantity made me suspect there were likely more issues
lurking in that code!

I confess the only Thumb stepping I've done has been on Cortex-M3;
not the same.  Are you testing on a chip with an ICE that
does hardware stepping?
 

&gt;<i> &gt;Those unexpected IDCODE message, like

</I>
Hmmm ... there are also bugs in the adaptive clocking support
for amt_jtagaccel.  There should be some FIXME comment there;
minimally, use the generic interface to that functionality
instead of a driver-specific version.


&gt;<i> Ended up hacking the code to do this as the driver code

</I>
I'm not clear what you mean by that ...
