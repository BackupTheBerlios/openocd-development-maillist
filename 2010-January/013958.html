I'd just call those &quot;registers&quot;, not SFRs, since they're
just regular parts of the data address space: there's
nothing &quot;special&quot; about memory-mapped peripherals.  In
fact it's the norm nowadays...

In my experience, SFRs are special pains in the posterior
since they live in yet another address space ... and need
either compiler extensions to address (which makes most
8051 &quot;C&quot; compilers aggressively nonstandard) if pointers
make sense with them, or else something on the lines of
a set of inlined assembly language accessors.

Yes, tools that support microcontroller developers tend to have
GUIs for such stuff.  Many Eclipse-based examples exist, I'm told.
And non-Eclipse ones too; like Atmel's AVR Studio.

</I>
Freddie's example (<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/embsysregview/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/embsysregview/</A>)
seems to have some XML based format.  But it looked at first glance
like not a very good one ... most of those Stellaris parts share the
same register structure, but it doesn't have ways to express that!
And I didn't see bitfield support there either.  There was another
sourceforge project like that, which I saw at some point.

I think an XML format is a fine assumption.  GDB includes an XML
parser for chip definitions, and such stuff is easy to work with.

For example, if OpenOCD had XML chip definitions, it could deliver
them to GDB ... or use them internally to spit out the HTML that
&#216;yvind wants to see.  Or even just have ways to dump them to the
Tcl command line.


&gt;<i> I know that embedded artists and code red have released some LPC-expresso
</I>&gt;<i> tool, that claims to have a SFR browser on board, but this is tied up on
</I>&gt;<i> some licences.
</I>
Those LPC-expresso things are pretty new.  Summary: $US 30 for
a combination JTAG/SWD adapter plus a Cortex-M3 or Cortex-M0
eval board, with some kind of size-limited CodeRed GDB/Eclipse
package.  One deduces a significant subsidy from NXP!  As if
they want to make sure it's easy for folk to start developing
with their new Cortex-M chips ...

It's DOS-only for now, though; no Linux support.  It might be
nice to get an OpenOCD driver for that adapter, but I suspect
they won't be keen on exposing its protocol.

Worth IMO someone evaluating the package for the OpenOCD project,
to help identify current OpenOCD weaknesses.  (Likewise with
other Eclipse-based JTAG-aware toolsets.  Atmel's AVR32 Studio,
TI's Code Composer Studio, and the CodeSourcery product all
come quickly to mind ... and I'm sure there are more.)

If it doesn't currently have one, I'd say that Eclipse should
have some standardized solution for peripheral register viewing.
Maybe one of the existing products can be the basis for that.
