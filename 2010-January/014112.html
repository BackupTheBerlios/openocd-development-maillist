Yeah, there are many types of critical section.

I think this is a good cautionary example of why halt-mode debugging
is sometimes undesirable.

A more visceral example is a saw controller ... if halted, it might
not be able to say &quot;NO!  Not the fingers!&quot;

Currently, OpenOCD does not support monitor mode debugging.  Most of
the ARM targets support it.  And I think I even saw docs on a Cortex-M3
part which included a debug monitor in ROM (was it from NXP?); I'd not
be surprised to see some folk looking at how to suport monitor mode in
the context of OpenOCD.


&gt;<i>	 PWM was still

</I>&gt;<i> If someone happens to halt core again in critical part - MCU would just

</I>
Yes, good example.  In fact, I think I'll update section 5.6 of the
User's Guide with some of your examples.  (That's &quot;stuff you might
want to change to make debugging your code work better with JTAG&quot;.)

Thanks!
