Thanks!  As I said elsewhere, I'll wait till Tuesday eve (PST)
for additional feedback before doing anything with Trac.  Right
now it sounds more likely to happen than not, with at least a
handful of folk willing to help make it happen.

Assuming I do turn it on, I think we'll try an RC2 as a dry
run.  Maybe we can fix some of those bugs you've uncovered.  :)

That's good.  But to be clear, having regression tests is
not what I meant (though it's extremely important for any
reproducibility of quality).

I was meaning more like &quot;periodic status updates with
specific reference to unresolved regressions and other
open bugs&quot;.
