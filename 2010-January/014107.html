Odd; I'd have expected that it's the debuggers which would set that!
Do you know why they don't?


&gt;<i> Both IWDG and WWDG watchdogs can be stopped while core

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Source: &#167;20.15.3 in STM32 Reference Manual UM0306. This register is also

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thought I saw docs for at least one Cortex-M3 core saying they

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   I will test this on the weekend to see if this is still true.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   Right now for debugging I have conditional that disables the watchdog if I want to debug.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;   I have the same problem with IAR so that is not an openocd problem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;      
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Of course, entirely disabling the watchdog can work too!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    
</I>&gt;<i> Running application under development with IWDG disabled can have 
</I>&gt;<i> disastrous consequences, even having no direct intention to debug-halt 
</I>&gt;<i> core in mission critical code sections. Been there, know that. Later I 
</I>&gt;<i> surrounded those sections with DBGMCU_CR &amp;= ~DBG_IWDG_STOP and DBGMCU_CR 
</I>&gt;<i> |= DBG_IWDG_STOP.
</I>
Yeah -- if you're going to use a watchdog, it's safest not to turn it off.
When you're using halt-mode debug it's sort of unavoidable though...

Thing is, a watchdog is a global constraint device, so I don't see how
guarding it like that only for critical sections would help.  


&gt;<i> &gt; I do that with WFI:  if debugging, just busy-wait in the idle task.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Otherwise the clock gating prevents me from talking to the core;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it's idle most of the time, after all!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    
</I>&gt;<i> Same DBGMCU_CR register with DBG_SLEEP and/or DBG_STANDBY bits set might 
</I>&gt;<i> help here - it allows clocking FCLK and HCLK from internal RC osc when 
</I>&gt;<i> core is in SLEEP or STANDBY modes, thus JTAG remains alive and well, 
</I>&gt;<i> just somewhat slower :-)
</I>
I don't actually use STM32, but I did seem to recall noticing that it it
provided a relatively complete set of controls to make on-chip debug be
less painful than on some other chips.  :)
