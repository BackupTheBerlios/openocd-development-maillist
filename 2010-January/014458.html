What would such a hookup amount to?

I know that Linux, for example, doesn't need such a thing.
One can just stick the bugtraq ID into patch comments, or
a commit ID into the bugtraq record.  That suffices.


&gt;<i> If we want to

</I>&gt;<i> Trac, I think it's still a good idea.
</I>
That's pretty much how every project I've ever worked on has
done things:  bug database and source repository aren't coupled
except by a convention about how to cross-link.  Works fine.

Fancier linkage could of course work too ... but is not required.


&gt;<i> They may eventually get the git 
</I>&gt;<i> connector working, but for now it's a no go. &#160;You can build the plug-in in a
</I>&gt;<i> shell on sourceforge, but I have no idea how to make trac aware of the
</I>&gt;<i> plugin. &#160;Here's a ticket about it:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/ticket/7674">https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/ticket/7674</A>
</I>
Let's hear from some more folk.  I mentioned this issue a bit
before I cut the RC1 release, and didn't hear any significant
negative pushback.  So I'm inclined to wait till maybe Tuesday
evening, just in case.

 
&gt;<i> Please, do consider using it. Having a viable ticket manager is a great
</I>&gt;<i> idea.
</I>
Note that &quot;manager&quot; has two meanings.  One is the programmatic
sense, a database with front-end.  (And there are more choices
than just Trac of course ... but with Trac we offload a lot of
work to the SourceForge team.)

The other one is a *person* tracking bugs etc.  That's always
the problematic meaning ... making sure the bug database does
not fill up with garbage.

Right now I seem to be the person doing this for the bugs
that can (or should!) affect the 0.4.0 release; nobody
volunteered to handle *any part of that* for the community.

... And as far as I can tell, this is the first release
cycle that's even had lists of bugs/regressions like that.

I'm a lot less concerned with the detals of how the list
of open bugs gets managed (email or whatever) than the
fact that it needs to be managed ... in a public/open way.
