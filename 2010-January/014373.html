Unfortunately I think you're starting to hit some of the ways
that the DAP code is ... a bit flakey.  Especially with respect
to how it handles errors reported by the DP or AP; it triggers
faults a bit more often (and randomly) than I would expect, and
the cleanup -- and mode selection -- looks a bit iffy to me.

I attach a couple patches which I've been using, which might
change things (or might not).  If they help, good.

 - adi-shrink.patch ... code shrinkage and fault path fixes

 - adi-write.patch ... goes over that, basically just cleanup

If not, then there's something else you could build on top
of these.  Basically, after adi-shrink.patch there is ONE
&quot;REVISIT&quot; comment about putting the memaccess_tck cycles in
the proper place.  Fix that issue -- just put those cycles
at the end of adi_jtag_dp_scan() not the beginning, after
the jtag_add_dr_scan().  (Before that patch, that was done
wrong in *two* places.)

The OVERRUN error comes from throwing data at the MEM-AP
faster than it can handle it.  MEM-AP speed is a system
specific issue.  Exactly the sort of thing MX51 could very
reasonably do differently from the other Cortex parts which
now mostly work.  (I'm not quite clear on how much of that
is driven by the JTAG clock vs by whatever core clock your
chip may be using.)  There are two issues I'd wonder about:

 * First, whether the code is correct ... ergo the
   attached patches and that REVISIT comment.

 * Second, whether you need a different memaccess_tck
   value.

The ADIv5 spec will be useful to sort out such issues.
