Hmm, so you're ahead of most of us!  Might you then be interested
in helping this project at least start to use it?

What would you describe as features that we should be particularly
interested in using?

As I say, it's a &quot;turn it on&quot; sort of thing, at first.  We have
not (yet?) turned it on.  Once it's enabled, I think there is
some simple config knob involved with the git hookup.  Then some
access control policies to arrange.  I understand that the
SourceForge folk have provided the generic parts of the hookup.

If there's no significant &quot;anti-&quot; sentiment by, oh, early next
week, I suspect the thing to do will be to turn it on and set
it up.  I'd seed it with my own current list, to start things.
