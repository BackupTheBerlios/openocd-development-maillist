</I>
You should fix that.  Is SRST wired?  If not, try to find out
how to issue a JTAG level reset ... maybe some SJC operations
will do the job, that's a common approach.


&gt;<i> Command handler execution failed
</I>&gt;<i> in procedure 'reset' called at file &quot;command.c&quot;, line 647
</I>&gt;<i> called at file &quot;command.c&quot;, line 361
</I>
And from here on, I'd expect various failures caused by not
having reset that core.  (On top of any other issues!)


&gt;<i> &gt; halt
</I>&gt;<i> AHBAP Cached values: dp_select 0x10, ap_csw 0xa2000002, ap_tar 0x54011080
</I>&gt;<i> JTAG-DP OVERRUN - check clock or reduce jtag speed
</I>&gt;<i> Read MEM_AP_CSW 0x80000042, MEM_AP_TAR 0x54011080
</I>
You're just going to have to find what causes that.

As I noted, the DAP code is a bit iffy, especially
with respect to fault handling.  There are periodic
reports of similar problems; they're not especially
reproducible.  Those are symptoms of timing-related
bugs; but if you look at the code and spec, you'll
probably end up scratching your head about various
things.  In the 0.5 series it's going to get some
reworking to support SWD transport, which I think
will likely shake out some of that flakiness.


&gt;<i> &gt; The OVERRUN error comes from throwing data at the MEM-AP
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; faster than it can handle it.  MEM-AP speed is a system
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specific issue.  Exactly the sort of thing MX51 could very
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reasonably do differently from the other Cortex parts which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; now mostly work.  (I'm not quite clear on how much of that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is driven by the JTAG clock vs by whatever core clock your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; chip may be using.)  There are two issues I'd wonder about:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  * First, whether the code is correct ... ergo the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    attached patches and that REVISIT comment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  * Second, whether you need a different memaccess_tck
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    value.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The ADIv5 spec will be useful to sort out such issues.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I tested memaccess_tck with small values as 8, 80, 100 and big values
</I>&gt;<i> as 100000. In all tests it returns same error message above. I just
</I>&gt;<i> noticied it delay a little more time to show this error msg when I use
</I>&gt;<i> 100000.
</I>
OK, so the memaccess_tck issue doesn't seem to be the main
problem here.

It's clearly time for you to pull out the ADIv5 spec and
start working with that and the code ...

That's pretty low level work, and will often not be very
straightforward.  Prepare for some frustration, and be
patient!
