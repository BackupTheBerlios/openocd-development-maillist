Against 0.3.1 it seems we don't have one...
Against 0.2.0 it looks like we do (did)...

(If I understand correctly.)


&gt;<i> A regression test should minimally include:

</I>&gt;<i> 1. test sequence
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. expected result
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
Actually, behavior change suffices ... so long as that change isn't
a bugfix, or documented as a new behavior (e.g. new feature).

Unfortunately not every behavior is documented clearly enough to use
the documentation to make a &quot;bugfix?&quot; call.

Changes in undocumented (or badly documented) behaviors are troublesome
in two ways:  first the docs; second that anyone relied on the behavior.

That's a real nightmare when anyone has committed to binary interfaces,
unless they're well versioned, since they're pretty much stuck forever
with being backwards bug-compatible.  Protocol interfaces are one flavor
of binary interface.



&gt;<i> Could you provide 1+2? (I could perhaps extract that information from
</I>&gt;<i> the logs, but
</I>&gt;<i> I want to hear more about what you intended and what you expected to see.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A few comments relating to the gdb sync feature and openocd/gdb
</I>&gt;<i> making fewer assumptions about the target:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Targets and interfaces will have some state when OpenOCD is not
</I>&gt;<i> running and/or the target is not connected. Obviously openocd should not try
</I>&gt;<i> to make much in the way of assumptions about disconnected targets.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I made a change where I made OpenOCD do *nothing* upon
</I>&gt;<i> connecting w/GDB, not even query the target.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This solves a raft of issues w.r.t. configuring what should happen upon
</I>&gt;<i> connect and how you put the target into a particular state.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You simply put whatever you want into
</I>&gt;<i> the gdb init sequence, no config options, fancy events, etc. Previously
</I>&gt;<i> openocd would issue a halt upon gdb connect, whether or not that
</I>&gt;<i> was something that the user needed or wanted to happen. Most likely
</I>&gt;<i> the user was unaware of it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, typically when connecting with GDB and loading you should do
</I>&gt;<i> something like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> target remote xxx
</I>&gt;<i> # the target is not affected or queried by a gdb connnect. Dummy values are
</I>&gt;<i> # returned and a white lie takes place w.r.t. that the target is halted.
</I>
That &quot;white lie&quot; may be problematic.  However, I've only looked
a bit at the GDB remote protocol, and I suspect that it's causing
some issues.  It doesn't *require* clean target identification, as
just one example ...


&gt;<i> # OpenOCD allows gdb to be in the halted state and have the
</I>&gt;<i> # target running or halted. You can resume openocd when the target
</I>&gt;<i> # is either running or halted, as the openocd GDB server will
</I>&gt;<i> # sync up to the target upon a stepi/continue.
</I>&gt;<i> #
</I>&gt;<i> # halt can *fail* before monitor reset init, so fortunally
</I>&gt;<i> # we have *complete* control over the gdb init sequence now
</I>&gt;<i> monitor reset init
</I>
This reset step is obviously not required in all cases.

I agree that it should not be *automagically* performed,
even the weaker &quot;monitor halt&quot; equivalent which was
happening prior to the &quot;gdb sync&quot; patch.


&gt;<i> load
</I>&gt;<i> # the gdb sync flag is set upon GDB connect,
</I>&gt;<i> # stepi will not step here, but cause a fresh set of registers
</I>&gt;<i> # to be fetched into gdb
</I>&gt;<i> stepi
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Example #2:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I want to get fancy and try to hotplug to a target and halt it:
</I>
I don't think I'd call that &quot;fancy&quot;.  :)


&gt;<i> # 1. start openocd
</I>&gt;<i> # 2. hotplug a target we want to examine
</I>&gt;<i> target remote xxxx
</I>&gt;<i> # we're now connected to the GDB server, OpenOCD has not
</I>&gt;<i> # talked to the target yet. GDB is &quot;halted&quot;, but really the target
</I>&gt;<i> # could be running or halted, we don't know. The sync flag
</I>&gt;<i> # is set upon connect, so &quot;stepi&quot; will not stepi, but wait for the target to be
</I>&gt;<i> # halted, if it isn't already and then fetch a fresh set of registers
</I>&gt;<i> stepi
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; press ctrl - c, if we're lucky, we can now debug the hot plugged target
</I>
I guess I'm puzzled why &quot;stepi&quot; would be used instead of
some kind of real &quot;halt&quot;.

Is the issue that GDB's &quot;remote&quot; protocol doesn't have a
very good notion of target state init?


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now.... hotplugging *can* work on simpler CPUs, but anything reasonably
</I>&gt;<i> complex(Cortex-A8, XScale, etc.), naive hotplugging is *very* unlikely to
</I>&gt;<i> be of much use.
</I>
XScale is kind of odd; it requires special magic to hotplug.
In large part that is ISTR caused by its funky requirement to
run with a baby debug monitor loaded into its mini-ICache.

Other than that ... what do you mean by &quot;naive&quot;?
