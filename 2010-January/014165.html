<PRE>I think breakpoint handling has been kind of a mess for a long time.
No documentation on internal interfaces ... and in some cases there
seemed to be internal conflicts.

... called by target_resume(), and which is called with handle_breakpoints=true
from handle_resume_command() and armv4_5_run_algorithm_inner() ... and with
that flag set &quot;false&quot; from other places.


&gt;<i> the argument handle_breakpoints is only used to deal with the condition in

</I>
If that flag is set and there's a breakpoint at the current PC,
it does some fairly awkward stuff to execute that instruction
then continue.


&gt;<i> But in function arm11_resume() (arm11.c) it is used to decide weather setting

</I>
We're slowly making the ARM11 code behave &quot;just like other ARMs&quot;,
but that's slow going ... it started being VERY different.  In
the current code (0.4-rc) it's changed to be a lot more similar;
large chunks of standard ARM infrastructure now work with it.

Note that ec64acf536942168b4e038c6720c83687d3a0d08 is where one
bug was fixed, making it do the same &quot;if there's a breakpoint
at current PC&quot; stuff for ARM11 ... previously ARM11 wouldn't
work with the standard run_algorithm() code.

The approach to breakpoint handling in the ARM11 code is not
quite the same as for ARM9.  Some of it is hardware-related,
and thus necessarily different.  One difference just avoids
doing some foolish and slow stuff:  ARM11 and Cortex-A8 avoid
modifying breakpoint or and watchpoint state unless it really
needs to change it.  See dpm_maybe_update_bpwp().  So where
ARM9 wastes time clearing and restoring breakpoints, those
newer cores may just leave them always active.


&gt;<i> The GDB cannot operate correctly for arm11, for gdb server call target_resume
</I>&gt;<i> with handle_breakpoints=0 which leads to the breakpoints cannot be set to the
</I>&gt;<i> target correctly.
</I>
Hmm ... is this a bug you've observed, or is this something
you've wondered after poking through the code?

I recall setting breakpoints through the Tcl interface and
having them behave correctly.  Haven't tried to do that any
time recently, though.  And I could believe there's a bit
of a semantic conflict between debug via GDB and via Tcl;
not one we want, of course!!


&gt;<i> Any one can explain what's argument handle_breakpoints 
</I>&gt;<i> meaning? thanks.
</I>
I've had that question many times myself.  You'll notice
there's about zero documentation on that topic, and its
semantics are evidently both overloaded and vague.
