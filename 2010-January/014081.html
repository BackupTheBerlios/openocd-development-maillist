Writing isn't the problem so much as writing bad
wrong things, I think.  ;)


&gt;<i> &gt; If that's part of the issue, you might be able to

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, it helps a bit. Adding &quot;CoreDebug-&gt;DEMCR = 0;&quot; to the start of my

</I>
To clarify:  it behaves fine  after adding that line,
no wierdness?

You should *NOT* need to do that.  A straightforward
&quot;do the right thing&quot; change to the M3 code might start
with writing the low half of DEMCR only to set up
halt-after-reset, or clear that ... and having some
kind of per-core flag to make sure that it doesn't
clobber any explicit catches of the reset vector.
(And making sure the vector_catch code behaves.)

Another question of course is what's triggering the
hard fault.  Do you know that yet?


&gt;<i> I still need to do a system reset (but no power-cycle), before the 
</I>&gt;<i> processor executes hard faults again! .. strange.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Re needing a power cycle, it's a bit suggestive that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DHCR and DEMCR are not cleared by &quot;normal&quot; reset...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, it's also in the cortex_m3_r1p1 manual:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;This register is not reset on a system reset.  This register is reset 
</I>&gt;<i> by a power-on reset. Bits [19:16] are always cleared on a core reset.
</I>&gt;<i> The debug monitor is enabled by software in the reset handler or later, 
</I>&gt;<i> or by the AHB-AP port.&quot;
</I>
That's what I meant:  your lockup not clearing without power cycle
suggested it was related to debug hardware registers, since they
should not clear except by power cycling.
