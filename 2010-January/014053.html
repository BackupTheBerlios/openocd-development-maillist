Well, here goes the science-fiction part :-) Some time ago there was a
concept to join two big open-source projects named OpenOCD and UrJTAG
to become one giant. OpenOCD could then serve a high level logic and
UrJTAG provide low level access to the hardware devices and interface
dongles. Do you guys think this could be accomplished, or those two
projects gone far different way? Maybe this SWD could be a good
starting point if there is a lot to be done on a OpenOCD side, while
UrJTAG has these interfaces organised already... Or maybe it is not
the time yet and some further development should be done (ie UrJTAG as
a library) before merge? Even so - maybe this is a good time to
prepare some API in OpenOCD for JTAG access - to support different
access modes (current jtag and future swd) or even methods (supplied
by externel UrJTAG-based library)..? I dont know OpenOCD internals but
maybe they are somewhat similar to these in UrJTAG [1]..?


&gt;&gt;<i> I have bought some voltage regulators (L6928D) for STM32Primer2 so now

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, I've heard those Primer2 things are kind of neat but have some
</I>&gt;<i> problems (not all those regulator issues are build errors).
</I>
Well at first I thought the whole primer2 was dead after I tried to
acces it with OpenOCD JTAG method, but playing with a scope and a
flashlight showed it was only a voltage regulator (u17 powering the
dac and the lcd backlight), so this trick can be repeated I think ]:-&gt;

These primers2 [2] are pretty cool for developing software and early
stage prototyping as there are already neat peripherials onboard -
color lcd with touchscreen, adc, dac, microsd slot, oboard rlink, nice
plastic casing and expansion slot - unfortunately except some
unresolved hardware design flaws, there were some software design
flaws but most of them are now recognized and solved :-) Still one of
the voltage regulators seems to be vulnerable for ESD / overvoltage
from usb line - in right moment I will play with some protecting
diodes/transil and different capacitors as suggested by designers to
verify if this helps :-)

&gt;<i> I wouldn't be surprised to see some SWD stuff be testable around then.
</I>&gt;<i> What would surprise me is having it do more than limp through some
</I>&gt;<i> basic enumeration. &#160;I suspect you could help with RLink support for
</I>&gt;<i> those boards.
</I>
Sure thing! I have even one interesting toy to play with rlink :-P

Best rehards! :-)
