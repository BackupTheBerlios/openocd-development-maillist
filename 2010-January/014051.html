It's not in 0.4 but I've been looking at some of the infrastructure
work that's needed to incorporate it.  Various non-mergeable patches
have been sent around.

I'll post some more later, but for now I see several areas that can
work somewhat in parallel until they combine:

 - Reworked ARM ADIv5 code, possibly interface updates.  SWD is
   part of ADIv5; it needs to switch in as a transport option.

 - Low-level interface updates.  Conceptually we'll need to have
   a &quot;debug interface&quot;, which can talk either JTAG or SWD and, in
   some common cases, switch between the two.

 - &quot;JTAG&quot; adapter updates.  Examples: FT2232 support on Luminary
   boards, Olimex ARM-JTAG-EW, RLink, more.

 - Enumeration/initialization/configuration updates.  We'll need
   to be able to talk to the same Cortex-M chip using either JTAG
   (which works well today), or SWD ... and switch between them,
   on the same board.  (The latter more to know we don't have big
   holes in your design, than to be used much.) 

The ADIv5 stuff will be the most finickey part, but a lot of it is
just cleaning up internal interfaces to stop presuming JTAG.

I rather suspect that we won't get support for Cortex-M0 (notably
the new LPC11xx chips) until SWD behaves.

</I>
Yeah, I've heard those Primer2 things are kind of neat but have some
problems (not all those regulator issues are build errors).

I wouldn't be surprised to see some SWD stuff be testable around then.
What would surprise me is having it do more than limp through some
basic enumeration.  I suspect you could help with RLink support for
those boards.
