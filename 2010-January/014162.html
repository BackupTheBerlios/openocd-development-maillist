A minor goal of mine was to throw OpenOCD at some AVR chips (AVR8
and AVR32) before 0.4 ships to see how it all behaves... assuming
I get around to that, it'll be with this patch included.

At some point it would be nice to sort out the various JTAG ops
on AVR8.  As I recall, they document only the ones used to write
flash and EEPROM, and perform boundary scan.  Whereas:

	The On-chip Debug support is considered being private
	JTAG instructions, and distributed within ATMEL and to
	selected third party vendors only.

Clearly, someone needs to throw a JTAG/SPI sniffer at some of the
transactions issued by AVR studio, and so some &quot;reverse engineering
for interoperability&quot;.  :)

(I forget the story for AVR32, but at least the Nexus parts are
publicly documented.)
