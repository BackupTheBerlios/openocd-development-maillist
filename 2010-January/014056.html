Neither one is all that large.  ;)

</I>
I don't think anyone has really looked at what would be involved,
but similar ideas have circulated.  It might indeed be a good thing
to share some of that low level code.

There's a lot of stuff OpenOCD does which UrJTAG doesn't, and I'd not
be surprised to learn the converse is also true.  I'm not sure any
breakdown could be quite that simple.  They don't do much for debugging;
that's a primary focus for OpenOCD.  Such issues bubble up through many
layers of interface.  We don't do much for boundary scan; ditto.


&gt;<i> Maybe this SWD could be a good 
</I>&gt;<i> starting point if there is a lot to be done on a OpenOCD side, while
</I>&gt;<i> UrJTAG has these interfaces organised already...
</I>
I don't believe UrJTAG has even looked at SWD ... it's not JTAG,
after all.  It couldn't host boundary scan applications or other
general purpose tools.


&gt;<i> Or maybe it is not 
</I>&gt;<i> the time yet and some further development should be done (ie UrJTAG as
</I>&gt;<i> a library) before merge? Even so - maybe this is a good time to
</I>&gt;<i> prepare some API in OpenOCD for JTAG access
</I>
Zach's been looking at some of the issues there, but I think the's
been focussed on the mechanics of it:  take current interfaces, get
them so they can be libraries called by other code.  That's clearly
a problem that would need to be solved ... but not the only one, and
IMO not really the hardest one.

The hard part is figuring out what such a programming interface would
look like.  Being able to switch modes (SWD to JTAG, JTAG to SWD) is
one thing.  We also have different implementation strategies (ZY1000
working quite differently than say an FT2232 based dongle, or bitbanging
through a parport or whatever); AFAIK more than UrJTAG.

Getting two projects to converge on such an interface ... lotta work!!


&gt;<i> - to support different 
</I>&gt;<i> access modes (current jtag and future swd) or even methods (supplied
</I>&gt;<i> by externel UrJTAG-based library)..? I dont know OpenOCD internals but
</I>&gt;<i> maybe they are somewhat similar to these in UrJTAG [1]..?
</I>
If you're thinking of SWD as anything more than an ARM-specific debug
protocol, re-think ...

There's a register access model that's part of SWD, part of the &quot;ARM
Debug Interface v5&quot;.  One talks to a Debug Access Port (DAP), which
generally provides memory-mapped access to most things on a SoC, including
debug hardware.  Same thing with using JTAG to talk to those cores.  The
focus is on DAP support, not transport options like SWD or JTAG.

See:  <A HREF="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp">http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp</A> under &quot;CoreSight and ETM
Architecture Specifications&quot;.  You can download the PDF after registering.
