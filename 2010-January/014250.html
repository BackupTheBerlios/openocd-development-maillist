$SUBJECT includes three patches ... which one do you mean?

Also, in what sense does it &quot;break&quot; anything?  As I noted,
this has been working fine for some time on FT2232.  So in
at least that straightforward sense, it breaks nothing.


&gt;<i> We should discuss more post 0.4(I need to choose battles

</I>
OK -- but, I'll get my initial response out there now,
like your initial query is.


&gt;<i> but essentially the interface_ layer should be *told* 
</I>&gt;<i> what the TAP state is after a given TMS sequence.
</I>
I don't follow.  For starters,

&gt;<i> &gt; +int jtag_add_tms_seq(unsigned nbits, uint8_t *seq, enum tap_state t);
</I>
does pass a state.   One issue with that state is of course 
the reality that when switching into SWD mode, or resetting
a SWD link, there *IS* no TAP, or TAP state, that's relevant.

The presumption that &quot;TAP state&quot; is meaningful at all times
would be a conceptual bug.  One that must not be continued
by any driver which supports SWD.

And that's clearly not documented as a substitute for the
error checks in current set of upper level JTAG state calls.
Which is why the updated pathmove()/statemove() logic does
not use that call ... it uses the low level primitives, and
continues using the current TAP state tracking mechanism.


&gt;<i> The 
</I>&gt;<i> current jtag_add_pathmove() passes this information to
</I>&gt;<i> the interface_ layer.
</I>
I just looked at patch #2 of the three, which modifies
that to use the new primitive when the underlying JTAG
driver supports it.  (Eliminating redundancy in those
interface calls.)

And I don't see how this changes anything of note.  There
is a mid-layer representation of the current state (after
executing any queued ops), and that's still present ... and
still visible to the interface layer.
