<PRE>Capture various bits of useful information that have come up on the
list but haven't yet gotten into the documentation:

 - Watchdog timers firing during JTAG debug need attention;

 - Some chips have special registers to help JTAG debug;

 - Cortex-M3 stepping example with IRQs and maskisr;

 - Clarifications re adaptive clocking:  not all ARMs do it, and
   explain it a bit better.

+Watchog timers are typically used to automatically reset systems if
+some application task doesn't periodically reset the timer.  (The
+assumption is that the system has locked up if the task can't run.)
+When a JTAG debugger halts the system, that task won't be able to run
+and reset the timer ... potentially causing resets in the middle of
+your debug sessions.
+
+It's rarely a good idea to disable such watchdogs, since their usage
+needs to be debugged just like all other parts of your firmware.
+That might however be your only option.
+
+Look instead for chip-specific ways to stop the watchdog from counting
+while the system is in a debug halt state.  It may be simplest to set
+that non-counting mode in your debugger startup scripts.  You may however
+need a different approach when, for example, a motor could be physically
+damaged by firmware remaining inactive in a debug halt state.  That might
+involve a type of firmware mode where that &quot;non-counting&quot; mode is disabled
+at the beginning then re-enabled at the end; a watchdog reset might fire
