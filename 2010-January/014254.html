<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> target remote xxx
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> # the target is not affected or queried by a gdb connnect. Dummy values are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> # returned and a white lie takes place w.r.t. that the target is halted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That &quot;white lie&quot; may be problematic. &#160;However, I've only looked
</I>&gt;<i> a bit at the GDB remote protocol, and I suspect that it's causing
</I>&gt;<i> some issues. &#160;It doesn't *require* clean target identification, as
</I>&gt;<i> just one example ...
</I>
This white lie is a little bit problematic, however GDB will fail if we don't
reply to the connect and then the second &quot;get registers&quot; packet, so
we don't have a choice but to lie here.



&gt;&gt;<i> # 1. start openocd
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> # 2. hotplug a target we want to examine
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> target remote xxxx
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> # we're now connected to the GDB server, OpenOCD has not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> # talked to the target yet. GDB is &quot;halted&quot;, but really the target
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> # could be running or halted, we don't know. The sync flag
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> # is set upon connect, so &quot;stepi&quot; will not stepi, but wait for the target to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> # halted, if it isn't already and then fetch a fresh set of registers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stepi
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> =&gt; press ctrl - c, if we're lucky, we can now debug the hot plugged target
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess I'm puzzled why &quot;stepi&quot; would be used instead of
</I>&gt;<i> some kind of real &quot;halt&quot;.
</I>
you could issue a monitor halt  if you want, I wanted to illustrate
the point that &quot;stepi&quot; will detect the target state and if the target is
running, stepi will wait for it to halt, i.e. &quot;stepi&quot; will sync up to the
target state.

&gt;<i> Is the issue that GDB's &quot;remote&quot; protocol doesn't have a
</I>&gt;<i> very good notion of target state init?
</I>
Worse than that. GUI's depending on GDB certainly don't have
a notion of GDB being &quot;halted&quot; while the target state is unknown.

The white lie is percolates all the way up to that GUI and things then
&quot;just work&quot;.

Never mind changing GDB, it would take *years* to get the GUIs to
follow suit.


&gt;&gt;<i> Now.... hotplugging *can* work on simpler CPUs, but anything reasonably
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> complex(Cortex-A8, XScale, etc.), naive hotplugging is *very* unlikely to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be of much use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> XScale is kind of odd; it requires special magic to hotplug.
</I>&gt;<i> In large part that is ISTR caused by its funky requirement to
</I>&gt;<i> run with a baby debug monitor loaded into its mini-ICache.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Other than that ... what do you mean by &quot;naive&quot;?
</I>
Hotplugging is a highly advanced feature to support robustly. JTAG
doesn't really to start, but engineers have discovered that they
can make a gamble on hotplugging working and getting a payoff
in terms of shorter debug cycles here.
