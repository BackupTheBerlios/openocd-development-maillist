<PRE>As far as bug databases go, I'm kinda partial to ticgit. It stores the whole bug database in one git branch that never actually gets checked out. It hasn't been updated in a while, but it's not exactly a complex system, either.

The only significant &quot;anti-&quot; sentiment I have is that the Trac git plug-in hasn't had an update since 28th of August of 2009.  I'm going to play with this a little bit with my sourceforge project that's hooked up to git and I'll get back to you.

Alright, it's impossible to do it, for now.  The Sourceforge people haven't setup the ability to have Trac connect to a git repository.  If we want to do only development tracking in the wiki and manage bugs and features in Trac, I think it's still a good idea.  They may eventually get the git connector working, but for now it's a no go.  You can build the plug-in in a shell on sourceforge, but I have no idea how to make trac aware of the plugin.  Here's a ticket about it: <A HREF="https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/ticket/7674">https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/ticket/7674</A>

Please, do consider using it. Having a viable ticket manager is a great idea.
