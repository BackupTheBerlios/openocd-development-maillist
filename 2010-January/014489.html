So it's an ARM7TDMI.  Those don't have the hardware stepping
support.  Your Thumb single stepping is going to be figuring
out where the next instruction (or statement) starts, then
setting a breakpoint there.  Since it's ARM7TDMI it doesn't
have the BKPT instruction; it'll use a hardware breakpoint.

The Thumb single stepping bugfixes I recall were mostly in
that &quot;where will the next instruction's address be?&quot; logic.
(OpenOCD uses a small instruction set &quot;simulator&quot;.)

Hardware stepping is a different mechanism than setting a
breakpoint before the next instruction ... the debugger can
actually tell the hardware &quot;run just one instruction!&quot; before
it resumes execution, and that's what the hardware does.

ARM9TDMI has it, as do some ARM9E-S parts (rev 1).  ARMv6-M
and ARMv7-M chips have it.  Higher end parts (ARM11, Cortex-A,
ARM9E-S rev2) seem not to have it; pipeline issues, I'd guess.
Some can set breakpoints on instruction address mismatch, which
acts like hardware single-step except in cases like loop-to-self
instructions or returning from some recursive subroutines.
