For the JTAG signals, it's the same protocol.  Same state
machine, etc.

For the &quot;auxiliary port&quot; it's what Nexus specifies; same
kind of difference as with the ARM trace port.  ISTR that
both are bidirectional parallel interfaces, plus normal
JTAG signals.  And both use 38-pin Mictor connectors; but
the pinouts aren't compatible (no surprise).

</I>
&quot;JTAGICE mkII&quot; JTAG-only debugger, vs &quot;AVR ONE!&quot;.  Both
support basic Nexus operations.  The mkII periodically
gets specials; I saw them last year for $100 including
a devel board.

The difference is the same as between ARM debuggers that
support the trace port and those which only deal with
the JTAG signals, except I think the &quot;AVR ONE!&quot; is a
bunch cheaper than any product I've seen that supports
the ARM ETM trace.  ($600 -- price is down! -- vs
at least four or five times as much.)


There are two key protocols involved.  One is the JTAG
level stuff, which I understand to be the same.  The
other is the command protocol over USB.  It'd make
sense that those differ, minimally because the mkII
doesn't support streaming of (voluminous!) trace data.

Both also support some non-JTAG protocols.  &quot;DebugWire&quot;
is a 1-wire variant that's Atmel-private; used on many
AVR8 chips, including the 8-pin ATtiny ones.  There's
a newish &quot;PDI&quot; thing, which I've forgotten about.

But there's no reason OpenOCD shouldn't be able to
support the Nexus-over-JTAG stuff.  It's how AVR32
chips work using the mkII after all.
