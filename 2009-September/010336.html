<PRE>&gt;<i> Reset to latch PLL settings?  Odd.  One would expect a reset to
</I>&gt;<i> re-initialize the PLL configuration too!  That's how it's done
</I>&gt;<i> on every other core I've had occasion to look at.  Such odd
</I>&gt;<i> requirements rate a comment. :)
</I>
yes, it's odd.  The plls are only reset by power-on reset, not SRST.  They come
up with all the multipliers and dividers set to 1. Changes to the PLL registers
are only latched when the &quot;reset-switch&quot; is set in software, which causes

&gt;<i> Is that software-triggered reset different from SRST?  If so, how?
</I>
a &quot;full CPU reset&quot; says the data sheet.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do boot loaders normally do with PLL setup then?  Sounds
</I>&gt;<i> like they look at the settings, and if they're not appropriate
</I>&gt;<i> they'll &quot;fix&quot; them and reset.  Wouldn't OpenOCD do the same?
</I>
The boot loader checks to see if the PLL is in the appropriate state.  If so, it
skips the initialization. The appropriate value is either a user-specific value
  or defaults to a value selected by a speed-step register in the core.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The reset sequence is a bit quirky IMO, and not yet up to some
</I>&gt;<i> things that it needs to handle.  There are a lot of flavors of
</I>&gt;<i> reset, many ways to trigger them, and special cases everywhere.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are event hooks for &quot;reset-assert-pre&quot; and &quot;reset-deassert-post&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> logic ... the &quot;reset-init&quot; is *way* late.  Are you sure &quot;reset-init&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> is the right hook to use for PLL setup on this core?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (src/helper/startup.tcl has an ocd_process_reset script which
</I>&gt;<i> you might not have come across ... showing the current set of
</I>&gt;<i> reset events and their invocation sequence.)
</I>
I see your point.  The config script was calling into reset recursively through
the event handler. I tried a few variations on the idea that the sequence is in
two steps: first program the pll registers is some event before reset-init, then
complete the rest in reset-init.

I kept getting &quot;target not halted&quot; errors until I put the pll setup in a
reset-halt-post handler.  I'm guessing the target needs to be halted to send the
commands.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The PLL settings are intentionally set to a lowest common value for all boards.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  If PLL and DDR settings are board-specific
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think you just said there that they wouldn't normally be the
</I>&gt;<i> same ... but that there could be a least-common-denominator
</I>&gt;<i> applied in some cases.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does this core do the usual, and (a) require PLL to get clocks
</I>&gt;<i> fast enough to run DDR, (b) include some SRAM for boot code to
</I>&gt;<i> use before DDR is available?  If so, it seems reset-assert-pre
</I>&gt;<i> might benefit from knowing it's prepping for reset-init (and
</I>&gt;<i> thus should setup the PLL if it's not already done, before
</I>&gt;<i> one of the resets) vs not (leaving that for the boot loader).
</I>
There is no SRAM. Boot code sets up the PLL and DDR in assembly before any RAM
is used (no stack access).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  then it is my understanding that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> entire reset-init script should be removed from the target script.
</I>&gt;<i> That's my general assumption, yes.  There could be reusable
</I>&gt;<i> code that provides hooks for board-specific behavior ... but
</I>&gt;<i> the reset-init script is doing a lot of what first stage of
</I>&gt;<i> a boot loader does, and that's *extremely* board-specific.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These chips have pin/ball configuration, yes?  And have
</I>&gt;<i> clock trees to set up?  And other stuff that varies based
</I>&gt;<i> on how the chip is wired into a particular board?
</I>
For this SoC most of the &quot;board&quot; is in the silicon except for one x16 DDR chip,
one SPI flash and the PCI bus. It's highly integrated. The DDR may have a
different density/speed. Maybe that can be a hook, along with the PLL setting
possibly.
