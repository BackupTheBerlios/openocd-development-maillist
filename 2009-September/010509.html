</I>OK so far. However, I would like to keep the current small objects like
those used in the CFI flash code, and download them on demand, instead
of one big blob that handles everything, because:

 - Buffer space may be severely limited on some CPUs, and by only
loading the one algorithm needed for a task, we make best use of that
RAM, freeing the rest for buffer. If we pack all code into one target
binary blob, it may expand to a size where not everything fits on some
targets.

 - Easier to maintain. We have target code for one single task (eg.
flash Intel-style NOR flash roms - just like the current CFI code does),
with a defined interface (input and output values at defined places in
the buffer), plus the matching host-side code inside OpenOCD that runs
that code.

I do think that the target algorithm code should be written in C, with a
small bit of assembler startup (just as much as is needed to setup stack
etc. to run C code). The startup code is CPU/architecture dependant and
needs to be written once for each supported CPU family. The algorithm
code is pure C and can be used without modifications on any target CPU,
regardless of the instruction set.

&gt;<i> Why do I suggest C? And the above method...
</I>&gt;<i>     Because it would work on *ALL* targets!
</I>&gt;<i>     One only needs to *compile* a small C program.
</I>&gt;<i>     And little helpers would be very fast.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Ack. The current code that is embedded in the CFI flash code is
difficult to read and even more difficult to modify, and is
platform-specific.


In order to make this work, we need some way to load and relocate the
object code to an address that is not known at compile/link time (or a
compiler that generates position-independent code for all plattforms).

I am not sure if we can simply use ELF files for the target code, and
use the existing ELF loader, with the addition of relocation if needed?

The ELF files could be shipped with OpenOCD (because you need
cross-compilers for all architectures to re-generate them), and the code
in OpenOCD would simply request to load &quot;cfi_intel&quot; to a target buffer,
which the general code then turns into a load of
&quot;.../openocd/lib/arm/xscale/cfi_intel.elf&quot;, handling buffer management,
setup and relocation.
