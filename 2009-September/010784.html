<PRE>Most of the cheap ft2232 devices probably do not have sense circuit on
SRST. Actually, I would like to have Vcc sense circuit on my Olimex
board but it is a different topic.

For most users, it is enough to be able to call reset routine defined by
reset_config. It most cases (I think) the user will know what is the
required reset pulse width and delay between reset rise edge and cpu
ready.

For example, on one of the boards I have, SRST is connected to sense pin
of a reset IC. The IC will hold board reset for about 200ms and then let
go. The CPU will need another 50 ms to do its init. So I can just set
jtag_nsrst_delay to 300ms. If openocd calls reset routine before doing
JTAG scan, everything will work just fine (even with fdt2xx driving
SRST/TRST wires on init).

I still think that this should be optional feature since some people
will want to connect to their cpu without resetting it (hopefully they
can use something else the ftd2xx library) in order to debug it.

In my case, I really just want to have the cpu in a known state when I
run my scripts and I am fine with the reset state.
