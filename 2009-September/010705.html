</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">development-bounces at lists.berlios.de</A>] On Behalf Of &#216;yvind Harboe
</I>&gt;<i> Sent: zondag 20 september 2009 19:53
</I>&gt;<i> To: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">openocd-development at lists.berlios.de</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: [Openocd-development] A few thoughts on OpenOCD long term goals
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One of my goals w/OpenOCD is that it becomes yet another
</I>&gt;<i> thing that hardware vendors have to &quot;check off&quot; on the
</I>&gt;<i> GCC toolchain list. Not having OpenOCD support should
</I>&gt;<i> be like not having GDB support.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a long way off, but it's something to aspire to.
</I>
Just keep pushing. We are looking for a SoC for a new platform and we are basically saying that only devices with OpenOCD support are considered.
 
&gt;<i> It would be nice to have support for other targets than ARM,
</I>&gt;<i> and we're doing well w/MIPS, but we really need a significantly
</I>&gt;<i> bigger community or direct support from hardware vendors
</I>&gt;<i> (the gorillas get things for free, the chimps don't...) to
</I>&gt;<i> boast equally broad MIPS support as ARM support. Either
</I>&gt;<i> that or ARM support has to reach a point of maturity where
</I>&gt;<i> MIPS can start to catch up. Then again ARM is messier
</I>
I don't know if MIPS is something to give much concern. IMHO MIPS is a dead platform unless the PIC32 is catching on which is unlikely since ARM devices are way ahead. Freescale's Coldfire would be much more interesting. I know Freescale is having a very hard time selling the Coldfire due to lack of Open Source tools support. The price of the devices is right, but the tooling is not.

&gt;<i> Eventually I hope that we'll be able to identify some killer
</I>&gt;<i> features that closed source solutions just don't offer and
</I>&gt;<i> that it will become uneconomical to implement from scratch
</I>&gt;<i> for each JTAG debugger. I don't really know what those
</I>&gt;<i> features might be though. Some ideas:
</I>
&gt;<i> - Threads support(e.g. eCos, FreeRTOS, etc. threads)
</I>&gt;<i> - Profiling support(??) there is profiling support in OpenOCD
</I>&gt;<i> now, but I haven't heard about anyone using it.
</I>&gt;<i> - Connect up to other GPL code. We're already connected
</I>&gt;<i> to GDB as much as we should be... What else?
</I>&gt;<i> - Killer FPGA soft CPU workflow support(not quite sure
</I>&gt;<i> what that means yet :-)
</I>
I think the best feature is that it just works. A lot of software does not have that feature!
