</I>&gt;<i> yes, it's odd.  The plls are only reset by power-on reset, not SRST.  They come

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;full CPU reset&quot; says the data sheet.
</I>
And not peripherals ... or does it say?  Vendors seem not to
make it easy to trigger a full SoC reset from software, short
of maybe forcing a watchdog to fire.


&gt;<i> &gt; What do boot loaders normally do with PLL setup then?  Sounds
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like they look at the settings, and if they're not appropriate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they'll &quot;fix&quot; them and reset.  Wouldn't OpenOCD do the same?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The boot loader checks to see if the PLL is in the appropriate state.  If so, it
</I>&gt;<i> skips the initialization. The appropriate value is either a user-specific value
</I>&gt;<i> or defaults to a value selected by a speed-step register in the core.
</I>
So a better solution for OpenOCD might have your reset-halt-post
script do the same thing:  read that register, and update it only
if the PLL settings are still at the default.  That way you won't
be pessimizing the timings each time you boot; the normal boot code
can provide the right ones for the board.


&gt;<i> &gt; The reset sequence is a bit quirky IMO, and not yet up to some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; things that it needs to handle.  There are a lot of flavors of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reset, many ways to trigger them, and special cases everywhere.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There are event hooks for &quot;reset-assert-pre&quot; and &quot;reset-deassert-post&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; logic ... the &quot;reset-init&quot; is *way* late.  Are you sure &quot;reset-init&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is the right hook to use for PLL setup on this core?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (src/helper/startup.tcl has an ocd_process_reset script which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you might not have come across ... showing the current set of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reset events and their invocation sequence.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I see your point.  The config script was calling into reset recursively through
</I>&gt;<i> the event handler. I tried a few variations on the idea that the sequence is in
</I>&gt;<i> two steps: first program the pll registers is some event before reset-init, then
</I>&gt;<i> complete the rest in reset-init.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I kept getting &quot;target not halted&quot; errors until I put the pll setup in a
</I>&gt;<i> reset-halt-post handler.  I'm guessing the target needs to be halted to send the
</I>&gt;<i> commands.
</I>
Or at least, it's coded that way.  :)

There are cores that work either way.  Of course, if you write
to memory or peripheral registers while the CPU is running,
and the code running there isn't prepared for that ... there
can be SMP-ish bugs.  


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The PLL settings are intentionally set to a lowest common value for all boards.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  If PLL and DDR settings are board-specific
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think you just said there that they wouldn't normally be the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; same ... but that there could be a least-common-denominator
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; applied in some cases.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does this core do the usual, and (a) require PLL to get clocks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fast enough to run DDR, (b) include some SRAM for boot code to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use before DDR is available?  If so, it seems reset-assert-pre
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; might benefit from knowing it's prepping for reset-init (and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thus should setup the PLL if it's not already done, before
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one of the resets) vs not (leaving that for the boot loader).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is no SRAM. Boot code sets up the PLL and DDR in assembly before any RAM
</I>&gt;<i> is used (no stack access).
</I>
So I'd guess it supports boot-from-ROM and boot-from-NOR, but not
boot-from-NAND or from other peripherals.  At least in terms of
the very first stage of booting.  Maybe OneNand works too.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  then it is my understanding that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; entire reset-init script should be removed from the target script.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's my general assumption, yes.  There could be reusable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code that provides hooks for board-specific behavior ... but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the reset-init script is doing a lot of what first stage of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a boot loader does, and that's *extremely* board-specific.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; These chips have pin/ball configuration, yes?  And have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; clock trees to set up?  And other stuff that varies based
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on how the chip is wired into a particular board?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For this SoC most of the &quot;board&quot; is in the silicon except for one x16 DDR chip,
</I>&gt;<i> one SPI flash and the PCI bus. It's highly integrated. The DDR may have a
</I>&gt;<i> different density/speed. Maybe that can be a hook, along with the PLL setting
</I>&gt;<i> possibly.
</I>
Hmm, interesting.

Your attached patch does look like a good improvement.  Gets
rid of that nasty recursion.  :)

A next step would probably be splitting out the PB44 ref board
assumptions from the core AR71xx support.

Also: the variable you should set is $_TARGETNAME, leading
underscore.  And don't use [format &quot;%s.cpu&quot; $CHIPNAME] to
set it; just &quot;set _TARGETNAME $CHIPNAME.cpu&quot; suffices.  The
users's guide covers the interop guidelines.
