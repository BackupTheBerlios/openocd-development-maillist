<PRE>I think this post touches on a wide range of interesting subjects...

It would be interesting to hear if you see OpenOCD anywhere...
Could you report back what you see?

- What itch do the hardware/tool vendors have that OpenOCD could
scratch?
- Do hardware vendors love, hate or don't care about the idea
of OpenOCD?
- What type of hardware vendors care about OpenOCD? (&quot;Why the
hell would we want *another* JTAG debugger???&quot; is what I've heard
so far...)
- The OpenOCD foundation again: gather money and use them for
something that OpenOCD needs that isn't currently happening by
itself.
- What's OpenOCD's ultimate aspiration? My personal vision is that
OpenOCD becomes an inseparable part of the GCC toolchain for
embedded work, just like GDB is.
- What value do end users perceive of OpenOCD? Target library?
Cheap dongles? Open source support?

Zylin has taken the role of gathering a test target hardware, we have
a reasonable selection of hardware and just about as many hardware
target boards that we're willing to take for a quick spin. Really where
they are the most useful is when debugging a specific regression and
I need some specific hardware to reproduce the problem...
I should add a list to openocd svn w/most wanted hardware to be donated.

Does anyone have an arm91sam9260 that they could donate btw?
