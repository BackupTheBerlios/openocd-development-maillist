OK, I'm calm, sorry.

First of all - I haven't found any info in the manual about what exactly 
does &quot;reset init&quot; do. Does it just reset and run the init script, or 
maybe it also halts after reset?

I don't know how should the GDB initialization commands look like:

monitor reset init
load
(let's call that &quot;v1&quot;)

or maybe:

monitor reset halt
monitor reset init
load
(let's call that &quot;v2&quot;)

I'm pretty puzzled about that...

&gt;<i> I asked because I recently removed soft_reset_halt from
</I>&gt;<i> lpc2478.cfg because it made things fail.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have no idea *why* it fails, so I hoped that you could
</I>&gt;<i> shed light on that problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> the implementation of soft_reset_halt isn't all that pretty inside
</I>&gt;<i> arm7_9_common.c, so I wonder if there is some unwanted
</I>&gt;<i> side effect(bug?) that we're running into....
</I>
Are you sure that it was the soft_reset_halt problem? As you see I have 
to disable MAM and PLL for my extremely simple code to run reliably. And 
the behaviour without that is pretty wild. My last experience with that 
was that I had two IDENTICAL pieces of code, but one of them was shifted 
by a word (the vector table wasn't - of course). One of them worked 
without any problems, the other failed completely.

Now here are my experiences with lpc2103 and the configs:

1. When there is &quot;soft_reset_halt&quot; in the script:

v1 fails - target not halted
v1 (without load) - works
v2 fails - target not halted
v2 (without load) - works

But: When I want to load I have to do:

monitor reset halt
load
monitor reset init

or:

monitor reset init
monitor reset halt
load

And this way it works

2. When there is no soft_reset_halt in the script:

v1 works
v1 (without load) fails / works wrong
v2 works
v2 (without load) works wrong

3. When there is &quot;armv4_5 core_state arm&quot; instead of soft_reset_halt:

v1 works
v1 (without load) works wrong
v2 works
v2 (without load) works wrong

For 2. and 3. cases that fail, I need to manually add soft_reset_halt in 
the gdb init command for things to work.

Generally most of the time monitor reset halt + monitor soft_reset_halt 
alone works fine, but sometimes enabled MAM and PLL make things go crazy...

This would be pretty cool to just use lpc2xxx like stm32: monitor reset 
halt (+ load) and that's all. That's doesn't have to be &quot;-halt&quot; but 
having &quot;reset init&quot; do all the job would be great, as now that's a 
lottery and shooting in the dark.

4\/3!!
