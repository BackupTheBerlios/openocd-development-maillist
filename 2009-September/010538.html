<PRE>It does seem that this is a timing issue. However adding various
usleep() around jtag.c and arm11_dbtap.c file does not produce errors on
r1817. Also increasing TAP_IDLE's does not break the code.

It might be more productive to capture some of the data going to ft2232
interface. Is there a simple way to add LOG_INFO()'s to show what is
being send out onto USB cable (in terms of commands or actual bits)? I
can add some timing info as well and compare r1817 &amp; r1822 output
versions.

Since all the data is written to memory and it is always correct, then
all arm11 commands (32-bit memory writes) are executed correctly. So,
the only issue is really with address incrementing. Which part of the
code causes the memory pointer to increment? Perhaps I can look at that
code.
