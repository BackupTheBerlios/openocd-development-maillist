</I>&gt;<i> I've looked at this and it is a pretty hellish problem to

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Agreed; I went the route of instrumenting the working and non-working 
copies to track the value of cmd_queue_end_state.  It wasn't terribly 
elucidating, but it did lead me to an unprincipled fix, which is 
attached as a diff.
&gt;<i> Anyone taking the time to look at 2046 in detail will conclude
</I>&gt;<i> that it is blind luck that 2046 worked and that there
</I>&gt;<i> is no way of figuring out what it did really did in all
</I>&gt;<i> cases by code inspection.... For your own sanity I don't
</I>&gt;<i> recommend trying to decipher 2046 vs. 2047... Short story: it
</I>&gt;<i> involves a global variable for the end state in
</I>&gt;<i> convoluted ways...
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Yes, my understanding is certainly insufficient to know what values 
end_state should assume.
&gt;<i> Here are a couple of things that need to be sorted
</I>&gt;<i> out for it to be humanly possible to figure out what
</I>&gt;<i> the arm11 code does and expect:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - &quot;tms_sequence long&quot; will pass through TAP_DRPAUSE  going
</I>&gt;<i> from TAP_DRSHIFT to TAP_IDLE.
</I>&gt;<i> - &quot;tms_sequence short&quot; will *skip* TAP_DRPAUSE going
</I>&gt;<i> from TAP_DRSHIFT to TAP_IDLE.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've got a request out to test arm11 w/&quot;tms_sequence long&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> If &quot;tms_sequence long&quot; works w/svn head, then we must fix
</I>&gt;<i> the arm11 code to have much more explict handling of
</I>&gt;<i> going passing through any required code.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Nothing works with head with i.MX35 (no code loading, let alone 
running), but the attached fix makes both 'tms_sequence short' and 
'tms_sequence long' work with r2047.  I realize this isn't terribly 
useful; when I get a chance I'll attempt to triangulate the next 
earliest revision that causes general failure.
