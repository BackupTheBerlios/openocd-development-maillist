</I>
I think Freddie pointed out that the frequency is used in two ways:
(a) configuring the flash write timings; (b) deriving the JTAG clock
rate, which seems to need about 1/8 that clock.  Some such frequency
setting is needed on most targets ... (b) can be avoided if RTCK is
in use, but I don't know that these LPC chips support it.

As for clock selection, crystal vs internal RC etc ... that problem
is related to the &quot;reset init&quot; issues.  It appears that the LPC2xxx
chips can't achieve halt-after-reset, so that some board-specific init
code is going to run ... and may set up the clock to whatever that
board needs.

Now, I think Freddie was being justifiably cautious and avoiding
that reset-init issue with this patch.  But this clock setup issue
doesn't seem like it can be avoided.  Either there's a new reset-init
scheme which sets up a known clock (ideally a crystal clock, since
those RC oscillators can be rather inaccurate) -OR- a board-specific
input parameter tells what value the on-chip setup code will have
arranged.


&gt;<i> And, Freddie, I hope you can bear with this conversation. I think that 
</I>&gt;<i> these things discussed in here does relate to each other, although some 
</I>&gt;<i> of them needs to be addressed separately really. In all and all I'm

</I>&gt;<i> LPC2xxx mess. Your proposed script layout is A LOT better than any I've
