Hmm ... I had been hoping that JTAG adapters would initialize
themselves to both SRST and TRST *inactive* but it seems we
can't rely on that in this case because the FT2232 chip itself
isn't cooperating.

Maybe we need something like a call to

	jtag_add_reset(0, 0);

very early in interface setup?  Plus something to flush it,
I guess.  If the JTAG adapter itself is going to glitch
those signals, we can't help that; but we can at least make
sure that we have a clean init state on our end, even if
the adapter sent the board out to lala-land for a while.


&gt;<i> &gt; Second, does this happen with &quot;libftdi&quot; too, or does that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; behave properly?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I tried libftdi but it has different problems. I gave up on it because I

</I>&gt;<i> CPU. So I actually don't know what it does.
</I>
Annoying.
 
 
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; ftd2xx is a closed source library. However, openocd should not rely on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; any libraries to properly reset a chip since these libraries do not know
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; what is a 'proper reset.' Openocd knows how it should reset the chip
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; from *.tcl scripts. So I propose to add a reset after ft2232_init (or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; any other generic libs such as libftdi*) and before the first JTAG scan
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to properly reset devices on the scan chain.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Again, I don't follow.  What are you saying the init sequence
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should be?  Which chip(s) should get reset when, and why?  Are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you referring to one of the chips on the target board?  Or maybe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the FT2232 chip?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> See my previous email to &#216;yvind.
</I>
Where -- to summarize ruthlessly -- you said that not only is
the FT2232 annoyingly imposing an SRST on you, but you also
need an extra delay to recover from that.  Right?


&gt;<i> I am talking about SRST/TRST reset as defined by reset_config command.
</I>&gt;<i> This is only defined for reset init/halt/run but not for initial scan of
</I>&gt;<i> the JTAG chain.
</I>
Actually that jtag_init() code will call the same jtag_init_reset()
that starts the &quot;reset halt&quot; sequence, *IF* the init_inner() fails.

Now, there are some problems in that init_inner() doesn't much like
to fail.  Maybe it should be less accepting... at least on the
initial invocation.

Correct me if I'm wrong (and please consult the jtag/core.c init
code to clarify):  (a) your init_inner() call sees chaos but
(b) doesn't fail, so (c) you're not getting that cautious call
to have jtag_init_inner() do SRST at OpenOCD startup through
that jtag_init() call, and thus (d) you're doing it yourself ...

... but if (b') it *DID* fail so (c') that got called as the
code wants to be done, then (d') it looks like it'd work OK
without needing the manual workaround?


&gt;<i> &gt; What OpenOCD tries to do today is first validate the scan chain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; defined to it using only TRST to ensure the TAPs are in a known
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; state, one which exposes their IDCODE registers (if any) ... and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if that works, it starts up without any SRST assertion, which is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IMO the correct default behavior.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If that fails, then jtag_init() will retry after a hard SRST
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; assertion.  Kind of unavoidable; maybe worth logging, that's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; kind of harsh.  I don't to see a running board needlessly get
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reset just because OpenOCD got started.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Dave
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do not see this behavior on a scope. The only thing I see is SRST/TRST
</I>&gt;<i> asserted by ftd2xx library. openocd does not seem to touch those signals
</I>&gt;<i> until you issue reset halt or similar.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, openocd hangs right after initial scan (if SRST is connected to
</I>&gt;<i> CPU reset) because the CPU returns garbage.
</I>
Where I've most recently seen that failure is if the JTAG clock
rate is set very wrong.  ;)

And come to think of it, I think it can't have been going down
the SRST path then either, despite what the code says to do when
init_inner() loses.
