&gt;<i> 1) One of the features that the software currently allows is configuration

</I>&gt;<i> of doing this for hardware-specific configuration files.  Over every
</I>&gt;<i> person's career, many of battle scars are left behind.  And I have many on
</I>&gt;<i> mine that were related to nightmare debugger/emulator configuration problems
</I>&gt;<i> where I tried to inherit one thing from another.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The one danger with inheritance in this particular scenario is many people
</I>&gt;<i> will see a target and naturally glom onto it without giving too much thought
</I>&gt;<i> about the consequences.  Many processor families have rather incestuous
</I>&gt;<i> relationships that share many common details, but inevitably have
</I>&gt;<i> differences -- often very subtle ones.  These little details, however,
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes generate big consequences.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The other danger always lurking with the current approach is that it is
</I>&gt;<i> entirely possible one developer can make a change to the underlying root
</I>&gt;<i> target file without realizing that it may propagate undesirable changes into
</I>&gt;<i> higher-level board files.  Unfortunately these type of issues are not
</I>&gt;<i> typically discovered until much later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For these two reasons, I wonder if it may not make more sense at some point
</I>&gt;<i> to discourage target configurations all together and encourage
</I>&gt;<i> self-sufficient board-level configuration files instead, even though this
</I>&gt;<i> normally goes against the grain of extensibility.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The key to making this work would be to break the directory structure along
</I>&gt;<i> processor models/manufactuer (i.e. arm926-ejs/atmel) and then lump
</I>&gt;<i> individual board configuration files under the appropriate directories.  If
</I>&gt;<i> a developer plans on using a particular processor in a design that doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> have an existing debugger configuration file, they quickly know which board
</I>&gt;<i> configuration files are likely to be similar and then clone it with little
</I>&gt;<i> risk of clobbering something else.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I don't think that would be a good idea. I see the problem, but your
approach would lead to several board config files that contain &quot;almost
identical&quot; copies of the target specifications, leaving the user to find
out the differences and wonder *why* something was put different in a
special config.

&gt;<i> 2)  One possible process improvement that I believe makes sense is to start
</I>&gt;<i> enforcing a rule that authors of new configuration files must include a
</I>&gt;<i> minimal comment header at the top of the file that specifies the exact
</I>&gt;<i> hardware/debugger combination used.  The SAM-ICE (J-link) debugger I am
</I>&gt;<i> using for example has a number of internal quirks that may not exist in
</I>&gt;<i> other brands and vice-versa.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>That sounds good.

&gt;<i> 3) One feature that I think may make sense to add at some point in the
</I>&gt;<i> future to the main software is support for label/value associations that
</I>&gt;<i> allow hexadecimal register values to be associated with more legible and
</I>&gt;<i> understandable names.  Looking at &quot;mww 0xffff3ec2 0x2&quot; in a configuration
</I>&gt;<i> script is more likely to introduce mistakes during reuse, then say &quot;mww
</I>&gt;<i> some_xyz_register 0x2&quot; where the name of the register clues you into what it
</I>&gt;<i> does or at least where to find it in the datasheet.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Agreed. I wonder if this is already possible now?
