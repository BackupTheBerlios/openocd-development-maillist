</I>Yes there is, but I think that when we connect to a target we just do  
omap3_dbginit right after init,
with no reset as  default. We do not always want to reset the whole 
system at every connection,
for instance when debugging a running Linux kernel or applications.

The when we need or want we can reset the system, which of course will 
call omap3_dbginit again.

This seems to work quite well with no recursive resets and not an 
endless stream of  failed communication attempts.

</I>&gt;<i> But that &quot;proc omap3_reset...&quot; looks good.

</I>&gt;<i> You're using &quot;2&quot; in part to avoid needing a reset-init handler to

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I havn'nt really thought to much about this,  first I wanted any 
reasonable functional reset functionality
without using the hard button or the power switch. We can test both and 
maybe even have warm_reset (soft_reset)
and cold_reset .

For the OMAP3530 I think we will end up in the X-Loader that set up DRAM 
for us,
the breakpoint registers seem to be cleared by the reset so to debug 
early startup we must be
quick  to issue the halt. Using the USB based dongle this is likely to 
be at least a couple of microseconds.

&gt;<i> I think that's not quite following the model which the code in
</I>&gt;<i> the src/helper/startup.tcl file is expecting ... a closer match
</I>&gt;<i> would use reset-assert-pre (or maybe &quot;post&quot;) not reset-start.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Same thing :) , I simply grabbed an event that was supposed to be early 
in the reset sequence, and one late in the sequence.

Regards,
Magnus
