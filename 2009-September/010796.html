<PRE>&quot;Petri Pirttinen&quot; &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">petri.pirttinen at tietolaite.com</A>&gt; napisa&#322;(a): 
 &gt; I may have missed something in here, but why trying to specify a crystal 
 &gt; frequency? Can't we use 4 MHz in here, IF we are setting the clock 
 &gt; source to internal RC oscillator in reset-init script anyway?

1. Not all LPCs have internal RC - just the &quot;more recent ones&quot; from LPC23xx and LPC24xx family - older ones (LPC21xx and LPC22xx) need a crystal to start and run.

2. To clarify - 12MHz is the default value for the chips without the RC. The ones that do have it have that frequency configured to 4MHz.
 
 &gt; And, Freddie, I hope you can bear with this conversation. I think that 
 &gt; these things discussed in here does relate to each other, although some 
 &gt; of them needs to be addressed separately really. In all and all I'm 
 &gt; quite thrilled about this as finally I get some light shred to this 
 &gt; LPC2xxx mess. Your proposed script layout is A LOT better than any I've 
 &gt; seen so far.

The things are related - true, but there is no problem in finishing with one and starting another then, not to simultaneously think about 10 different things. IMHO we'll never go anywhere while &quot;jumping around&quot; like this.

Anyway - to be honest - I don't know what should I / we do now. The frequency IS required, it has to be specified some way or another. Unfortunatelly I think only the method proposed in the file I posted is user friendly - the need for next &quot;wrapper script&quot; that would specify that just because &quot;frequency is not specific to targets&quot; seem extremely &quot;un-friendly&quot; to me.

How should that case be continued? I really don't know what other change is expected to happen in that file...

4\/3!!
