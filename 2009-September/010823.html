Still chasing down why two ARM926 based boards don't reset right;
those are a regressions.  I've got a bit of progress; patches that
switch from &quot;OpenOCD startup works but 'reset' fails&quot; over to the
other way around.  There's a clue in there, somewhere.  ;)

I'm thinking that the ICEpick support will *NOT* get additional
reset hooks needed to automatically bring up an ARM; that'd be a
significant update, and it's not yet ready.  So for now it'll need
manual workarounds.  In the same way ... ability to issue resets
(albeit limited, for now) even on boards without SRST.  With the
least bit of luck those will both be in the 0.4 code base, and
support for BeagleBoard.org hardware will be past staggering and
up to medium-speed limping.

Not clear on the status of those LPC2xxx things.  I think they'd
be ready to go if they didn't set up bogus clock rates...

Wondering about the issues Wookey has reported; I've not verified
anything on my main remaining x86_32 box lately, just x86_64.  And
I'm glad I didn't try upgrading that one CPLD that needs it!!


There may be a few other issues ... I suggest folk with such things
follow up on this thread.


&gt;<i> Do we want to have an -rc release process this time around?
</I>
That might be a useful way to help focus testing; but for now
I don't think I'll advocate either way.  Given the issues noted
above I'm not sure we're quite ready for an RC yet.
