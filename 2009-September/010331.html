Reset to latch PLL settings?  Odd.  One would expect a reset to
re-initialize the PLL configuration too!  That's how it's done
on every other core I've had occasion to look at.  Such odd
requirements rate a comment. :)

Is that software-triggered reset different from SRST?  If so, how?

What do boot loaders normally do with PLL setup then?  Sounds
like they look at the settings, and if they're not appropriate
they'll &quot;fix&quot; them and reset.  Wouldn't OpenOCD do the same?


&gt;<i> If reset_halt is not there the processor is not halted after this new 
</I>&gt;<i> reset.  Perhaps there is another way to do this, but it's working for me.
</I>
The reset sequence is a bit quirky IMO, and not yet up to some
things that it needs to handle.  There are a lot of flavors of
reset, many ways to trigger them, and special cases everywhere.

There are event hooks for &quot;reset-assert-pre&quot; and &quot;reset-deassert-post&quot;
logic ... the &quot;reset-init&quot; is *way* late.  Are you sure &quot;reset-init&quot;
is the right hook to use for PLL setup on this core?

(src/helper/startup.tcl has an ocd_process_reset script which
you might not have come across ... showing the current set of
reset events and their invocation sequence.)


&gt;<i> The PLL settings are intentionally set to a lowest common value for all boards.
</I>&gt;<i>  If PLL and DDR settings are board-specific
</I>
I think you just said there that they wouldn't normally be the
same ... but that there could be a least-common-denominator
applied in some cases.

Does this core do the usual, and (a) require PLL to get clocks
fast enough to run DDR, (b) include some SRAM for boot code to
use before DDR is available?  If so, it seems reset-assert-pre
might benefit from knowing it's prepping for reset-init (and
thus should setup the PLL if it's not already done, before
one of the resets) vs not (leaving that for the boot loader).


&gt;<i>  then it is my understanding that 
</I>&gt;<i> entire reset-init script should be removed from the target script.
</I>
That's my general assumption, yes.  There could be reusable
code that provides hooks for board-specific behavior ... but
the reset-init script is doing a lot of what first stage of
a boot loader does, and that's *extremely* board-specific.

These chips have pin/ball configuration, yes?  And have
clock trees to set up?  And other stuff that varies based
on how the chip is wired into a particular board?
