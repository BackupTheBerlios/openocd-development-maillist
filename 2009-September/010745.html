The alignment warnings showed up on ARM too.  It's not
clear just disabling them is safe ... they can expose
real problems, because unaligned access is not necessarily
going to work.  They seem to need Real Fixes, like by
switching to more generic bitmap utilities (such as the
ones in Linux, which also embed CPU-specific optimizations)
which don't wrongly assume unaligned access is peachy.

I think you must also have seen an awful lot of bogus
use-before-assign warning from you compiler.  Some
versions of GCC are bad that way; can you switch to
a newer compiler, which doesn't suffer from that bug?

Also, your editor somehow mangles UTF-8 characters...
like the sanity test provided by &#216;yvind's name.  ;)
