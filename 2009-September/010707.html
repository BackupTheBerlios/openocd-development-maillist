<PRE>Hi,
because I'm particularly newbie in Linux debugging, I have another view than
you. Im trying to run jtag + openocd + gdb + something (Eclipse) to run, and
there is several another problems than openocd which needs to be solved.
Jtag + openocd + gdb runs perfectly (if you find your jtag and chip in /
scripts) - but Im missing here some simple how-to for beginners which will
be on 20 lines max. something like: Find your jtag key in /scripts/...  and
find your chip in /scripts/...      try to run:   openocd -f your_jtag.cfg
-f your_chip.cfg     if you see something like this ... than everything is
ok. Well make openocd to work takes me cca 1/2 day work (currently release
dont support jtagkey2 ...).   Another problem is to make it work with some
IDE. Plain GDB is for hardcore programmers. Im trying to configure Eclipse
to be cool with ARM debugging - but im not eclipse guru and Im experiencing
problems with breakpoint limiting (only two for HW breakpoint in LPC23xx)
and viewing SFR registers .... Well openocd + jtag + eclipse takes me more
than one day .... and it is not working in the way how i need it...    For
you it is probably easy for setup GDB scripts (will be cool to publish some
with open ocd), but for beginners it is uncovered area. However tis is not
directly belong to openocd project, but in future plans it may be
considered.

&gt;<i> One of my goals w/OpenOCD is that it becomes yet another
</I>&gt;<i> thing that hardware vendors have to &quot;check off&quot; on the
</I>&gt;<i> GCC toolchain list. Not having OpenOCD support should
</I>&gt;<i> be like not having GDB support.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a long way off, but it's something to aspire to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Short term(a year or so), I'd like to see robustness for
</I>&gt;<i> the ARM target *much* improved and the target library
</I>&gt;<i> become increasingly support more targets and support
</I>&gt;<i> them better. OpenOCD should be the best and cheapest
</I>&gt;<i> alternative (in terms of engineering &amp; marketing effort) for
</I>&gt;<i> ARM chip vendors. I'm not concerned about hardware cost
</I>&gt;<i> to developers, because putting an ft2232 on an eval
</I>&gt;<i> board costs $1, it doesn't get any cheaper...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be nice to have support for other targets than ARM,
</I>&gt;<i> and we're doing well w/MIPS, but we really need a significantly
</I>&gt;<i> bigger community or direct support from hardware vendors
</I>&gt;<i> (the gorillas get things for free, the chimps don't...) to
</I>&gt;<i> boast equally broad MIPS support as ARM support. Either
</I>&gt;<i> that or ARM support has to reach a point of maturity where
</I>&gt;<i> MIPS can start to catch up. Then again ARM is messier
</I>&gt;<i> than MIPS. PowerPC is hard because OpenOCD does not
</I>&gt;<i> have the leverage to pry open the NDAs that shroud the
</I>&gt;<i> PowerPC architecture so that gets to be a pain with open
</I>&gt;<i> source development.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In terms of getting levarage with smaller chip vendors,
</I>&gt;<i> I believe <A HREF="http://www.vinchip.com">http://www.vinchip.com</A> is a case in point, but
</I>&gt;<i> I have no idea if their 32 bit risc is just another ARM
</I>&gt;<i> or whether it's something proprietary(didn't really look).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Eventually I hope that we'll be able to identify some killer
</I>&gt;<i> features that closed source solutions just don't offer and
</I>&gt;<i> that it will become uneconomical to implement from scratch
</I>&gt;<i> for each JTAG debugger. I don't really know what those
</I>&gt;<i> features might be though. Some ideas:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Threads support(e.g. eCos, FreeRTOS, etc. threads)
</I>&gt;<i> - Profiling support(??) there is profiling support in OpenOCD
</I>&gt;<i> now, but I haven't heard about anyone using it.
</I>&gt;<i> - Connect up to other GPL code. We're already connected
</I>&gt;<i> to GDB as much as we should be... What else?
</I>&gt;<i> - Killer FPGA soft CPU workflow support(not quite sure
</I>&gt;<i> what that means yet :-)
