And they're mostly core-specific.  Stuff like the
DCC support on ARMs, where ARMv4 and ARMv5 share
the same model (cp14 based), XScale morphed it by
taking away one bit, and newer ARM cores changed
the JTAG level interfaces in various ways.

Plus the calling conventions aren't necessarily
going to be portable ... and some of them need
customized exit conditions.  Which registers are
used as inputs will matter; that assumes params
fit in registers, which is _probably_ a safe
assumption  to make.

And vice versa.  Or AVR8; or AVR32.  With hardware ECC,
NAND-related code snippets need to be controller-specific
instead of core-specific.

One aid might be to have a small library of standard
code fragments, written in C, that new targets should
try to package -- for optimization.  CFI support would
be a useful test:  the accelerators are currently there
only for ARMv4 and ARMv5 cores.  (Though there's no
reason they shouldn't work on ARMv6 and ARMv7...)


I guess I don't quite see the point to coming up with
something more generic than target algorithm support.

For ARM there's a current reusability problem:  when
the code *could* be reused, that's needlessly blocked
because the run_algorithm() interface isn't generic
enough to ignore what core is underneath.

Before bringing MIPS into that picture I suggest it's
best to get ARM sorted better.
