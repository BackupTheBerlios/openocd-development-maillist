much since the part are still under NDA.
They are AVR32. The documentation on the debugging is not published, at 
least that is what someone at Atmel told me.
The same person told me that they have no intention on publishing it.
I do have documentation on the JTAG flash programming. You will know 
more about those parts sometimes in Q4.
They have the two protocols, they are not the same. The nexus part 
involves a very expensive emulator style device while
the other one is just the Atmel version of JTAG debugging.
I am told that the design of the AVR32 is custom from Atmel and from the 
ground up. That could be a reason that they can
offer such good pricing as they don't have to pay a fee to ARM or MIPS.
