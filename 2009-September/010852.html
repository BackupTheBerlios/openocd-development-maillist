&gt;<i> How would you write a board file for a board with two LPC2103 in the
</I>&gt;<i> chain? A simple source [find target/lpc2103.cfg] source [find
</I>&gt;<i> target/lpc2103.cfg] wouldn't work because it would try to declare two
</I>&gt;<i> targets with the same name (lpc2103.cpu).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Previously it was possible to write: set CHIPNAME chip1 source [find
</I>&gt;<i> target/lpc2103.cfg] set CHIPNAME chip2 source [find
</I>&gt;<i> target/lpc2103.cfg] It gave you two targets chip1.cpu and chip2.cpu.
</I>
You should not source lpc2103.cfg twice, but lpc2xxx_internals.tcl twice
- with all necessary defines. A little more text unfortunately.

&gt;<i> Regarding the clock speed: What you call CRYSTAL_FREQ is the
</I>&gt;<i> frequency that is in use when you do the flash programming. In order
</I>&gt;<i> to be able to maximize the download speed, I want to enable the PLL
</I>&gt;<i> in the &quot;reset init&quot; script. This operating frequency isn't really
</I>&gt;<i> related to the crystal frequency, and I think the name CRYSTAL_FREQ
</I>&gt;<i> is misleading. Many people in the past had problems with flash
</I>&gt;<i> programming because they specified the crystal frequency where they
</I>&gt;<i> should have used the real CCLK!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This clock frequency is something that the user should specify in a
</I>&gt;<i> board file.
</I>
Do you suggest renaming CRYSTAL_FREQ to (for example) CCLK_FREQ or some
other changes?

&gt;<i> The reset init script must be available to the user, because he needs
</I>&gt;<i> it to add the PLL initialization. Where would I enable the PLL when a
</I>&gt;<i> default reset init script is already defined in the target script?
</I>
 From what I have noticed all LPC2xxx have exactly the same PLL 
configuration scheme, so that's more like target related in my opinion. 
The PLL setup code will work (when written right) on all LPC2xxx chips. 
The only concen is the difference between the chips with / without 
internal RC.

&gt;<i> The working area should start at 0x40000200. This makes sure that
</I>&gt;<i> there is no conflict with possible temporary storage of IAP code (has
</I>&gt;<i> been a problem in the past, although the 0x40000000--0x400001FF area
</I>&gt;<i> should have been used by ISP code only). A strict requirement is to
</I>&gt;<i> not touch the upper 32 bytes of the internal SRAM. This RAM area is
</I>&gt;<i> definitely used by the IAP routines internally!
</I>
Sounds reasonable, but in my experience I haven't noticed any problems 
with using exactly whole RAM.

&gt;<i> There are devices with external memory bus. A user might want to use
</I>&gt;<i> an external RAM for the working area instead of the internal SRAM.
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore I think the working area declaration is board specific and
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't belong to the target declaration.
</I>
The start of working area can be made &quot;overridable&quot; with default being 
0x40000000.

&gt;<i> What do you think about modifying the LPC2000 flash driver to adapt
</I>&gt;<i> itself to the various devices? It can read the part id and
</I>&gt;<i> auto-configure itself. You could keep the FLASH_SIZE and RAM_SIZE
</I>&gt;<i> variables to override any automatic detection. I feel it would make
</I>&gt;<i> life a lot easier!
</I>
I've noticed that ideas of auto-whatever are not liked here &lt;: For me 
that's cool, but beyond my knowledge.

With every modification that is suggested the script is becoming more 
and more complex. At the beginning (in my original idea) all that was 
required was the chip name. Then the part config files need all the 
details. Now there is a need for another level of abstraction with 
wrapper script to configure the clock. You propose individual reset-init 
scripts and individual work area placement...

To be honest, I'm loosing the faith in this whole idea, because the 
complex is becoming more complex, not simple...

4\/3!!
