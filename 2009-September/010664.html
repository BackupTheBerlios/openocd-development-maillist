Longer term, having a solid Free Software competitor will
affect the market in various ways.  JTAG adapter vendors,
and chip vendors needing JTAG support, will get used to
having non-proprietary alternatives not unlike compiler
vendors did.

Near term, it's not yet as solid as we'd like.

That seems like it should be very achievable; a good goal.
Getting there will require more work.  :)

I understand that TI's Code Composer Studio v4 (CCS) switched
to Eclipse ... but a not-current one (when they did that work;
an updated CCS, with newer Eclipse, is on the way) in part
because the GDB debug model was inadequate to the tasks they
needed JTAG debugging to handle.

That makes me suspect that GDB changes in that area may well
be in the cards.
