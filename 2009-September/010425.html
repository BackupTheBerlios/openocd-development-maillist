<PRE>david&gt; Having a hundred or so chip-specific config files is
david&gt; a messy concept...

Yes, but that is exactly what is needed.

If there are 100 chips - you need 100 files, with 100 names.

Take the &quot;openocd-developer-hat&quot; off for a little bit and think about this.

Configure files are something *END*USERS* mess with.

Yes, from our end (the developer end) 100 files is a P.I.T.A, but it is 
exactly what the *end*user* needs, or they at least need the *SIMPLE* 
means to add the +1 more file they need.

As an *end*user* if I saw a sequence of filenames that I recognized I 
could examine a few of them - see the simple pattern and settings and 
could probably follow that simple pattern successfully. By simple I 
mean: perform lots of &quot;set VARNAME   VALUE&quot; - then include/source a 
common file.
Most developers would understand and modify a simple TCL statement like 
this with great success:

    # This chip has 16K flash..
    set   FLASH_SIZE   0x4000

But instead, using Freddies' approach - one has to (or is lead to 
believe they must) read through the &quot;complicated internals&quot; file which 
is where lots of magic is happening - magic that is to the benefit of 
the maintainer who understands the complexities of the chip family, and 
the scripts, and perhaps knows a little bit of TCL.

Wearing a &quot;naive new users hat&quot; - I would see the big internal file 
Freddie has and assume that I should &quot;weave&quot; my new chip into that file, 
and become very confused. That is *NOT* something I think we want users 
to do.

Bottom line:

1)   Freddies 'internal' file does too much, and does too much
      magic about figuring things out.

     It is ok for the 3 of us to understand...
     Remember: Our goal is the *end*user*

2)  We don't need to create 100 files for 100 chips.. instead we
      need to create a few of them - such that is very *CLEAR*
     to a new user how to add 1 more.

That's why we converted the configuration files into 3 &quot;source&quot; statements

    (1) the interface
    (2) the board
    (3) which includes a chip...

In the past, there was just one configuration file users where weaving 
their changes into other files. By splitting them up - it made it easier 
to understand.

SUGGESTION

Freddie could create a simple textfile/database and generate 100 &quot;chip 
files&quot; from a quasi-table of some sort... that only runs in &quot;maintainer 
mode&quot;.

BETTER SOLUTION:

In contrast, if the *SCRIPT* would examine the chip some how - and read 
registers and/or other things it *could* configure it self auto 
magically. For example ATMEL at91 series parts have some registers in 
the DEBUG UART at a fixed address...

I just don't think this better solution is that easy to implement.

-Duane.
