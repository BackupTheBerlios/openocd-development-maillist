We try to avoid committing obvious new bugs; and this
crystal rate is sort of in that category.

I think there's fair agreement that being able to
have a bunch of &quot;set this; set that; ...&quot; followed
by a &quot;source generic lpc2k setup code&quot; would be a
better way to work than the current approach.

Please don't worry about needing a few iterations to
get this right.  Particularly not one that touches
so much user-visible stuff.  It's pretty routine in
most projects that cleaning up big messes takes a
while to get right.


&gt;<i> I really have no idea what are you talking about now -
</I>&gt;<i> if someone want's to use LPC he/she has to set up
</I>&gt;<i> correct crystal frequency - the flashing fails BADLY
</I>&gt;<i> without that. That's all. It was like this since the

</I>
If you don't see what's wrong about forcing every
single LPC2xxx chip to use &quot;12 MHz&quot; even if that's
not the *correct* frequency for their board ... I
don't know what more I could try to explain.


&gt;<i> My opinion on this subject is just like with resets -
</I>&gt;<i> the bug (if there really is one) WAS there from the
</I>&gt;<i> beginning, so - for me - it can still be there for
</I>&gt;<i> a while, as I cannot solve this issue.          
</I>
It's different though.  You're not leaving the old
bug alone/unchanged ... instead you've polished it
and are presenting it just as if it were a feature.

Better would be to to fail hard if the board doesn't
set up the crystal frequency; and to compute the JTAG
clock based on xtal/8 (or whatever).  What I think I
saw was you using the xtal frequency more or less
right (other than JTAG clock computation) ... except
that it needs to be an input, not a constant.
