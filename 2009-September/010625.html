Item 1:

It sounds like you want options from from the &quot;dos/unix&quot; command line in 
a batch file format.  Why don't you _dynamically_ create the 
configuration file:    &quot;openocd.cfg&quot; - with your command line parameters 
inside it. You could for example - create a &quot;perl&quot; script - that (a) 
parses your command line options, (b) creates an &quot;openocd.cfg&quot; file then 
(c) executes openocd with the &quot;-f &lt;CONFIGFILENAME&gt; option&quot; pointing at 
your temporary 'openocd.cfg' file.

At this point, you have &quot;openocd commands&quot; - and 'getopt' is out of the 
questions.

Item 2: -

If you want to use JIM based commands ... {and I don't think it is what 
you want}

{Historical note: When OpenOCD was written 'JIM-TCL' did not exist, some 
commands are &quot;JIM&quot; commands, some commands are old-school}
This item talks about JIM commands.

For examples of how to do JIM options &amp; commands,  take a look at the 
file: &quot;target.c&quot; - look for the   function that impliments  the target 
command. Also - search around the code for a common (local) variable 
name &quot;goi&quot; - stands for &quot;Get Option Info&quot; - it is a bit ugly (I wrote 
it) i was trying to make it easier to create common option handling 
sequences in some common way. [Jim.c  - by default - does everything 
'in-line' ]

There are options/methods to handle  &quot;Enumerations&quot; - Options with 
numbers, etc.

Another file too look at would be the &quot;jtag.c&quot; file - where the taps are 
created.

Item 3: - Old School Commands

Best choice, since you are looking at NAND stuff is look at how the 
${SRC}/flash/nand.c commands are handled

Also - I believe David has done quite a bit of work with the Nand code.

Or look at the other &lt;FOOBAR&gt;_nand.c files
