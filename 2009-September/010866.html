<PRE>I just returned from the 2009 Embedded Systems Conference in Boston.  I
spent most of my time in classes and didn't spend a lot of time checking out
the exhibitors but I did get a chance to talk to a few of them and make at
least one round a day through the exhibit hall.

I actually saw a Amontec JTAGkey 2 at a booth setup by Intrepid Control
Systems, Inc (<A HREF="http://www.intrepidcs.com">http://www.intrepidcs.com</A>)
They mosty provided software for hardware acquisition devices (SPI, I2C, CAN
etc.) ... plus scopes ...

Other booths that I checked out or saw:
Arium
Lauterbach
SEGGER (jlink etc.)
Total Phase (Beagle I2C/SPI, Aardvark etc.)

The BeagleBoard Workshop was great.  It was good to meet Jason Kridner and
Gerald Coley (inventors of BeagleBoard) from Texas Instruments Open
Platforms.
There were several BeagleBoard classes ... Bill Gatliff gave one on Android
on the BeagleBoard.
Microsoft was pimping their Windows Embedded pretty hard ... Windows stuff
everywhere and they also had a BYOES (Build/bring Your Own Embedded System)
all day tutorial on the new Atom processor
<A HREF="http://esc-boston.techinsightsevents.com/byoes">http://esc-boston.techinsightsevents.com/byoes</A>

Robert Brunner (of Apple fame) gave a pretty cool keynote address (I skipped
the Microsoft guy that spoke after him).  Hopefully a video of his speech
will show up on YouTube or somewhere as it would be worth watching again.
It wasn't your normal keynote and he &quot;gets it&quot; when it comes marketing and
brand building.  He gave a challenge to the audience &quot;Do you matter&quot;, a
theme from one of his recent books  <A HREF="http://www.doyoumatter.com/">http://www.doyoumatter.com/</A>

Brunner frequently speaks to engineering students at Standford and he
recently asked a class if Motorola went out of business, who would cry and
be upset ... no one raised their hand.  Then he asked them if Apple went out
of business, how many would cry and be upset and over half the class raised
their hands and then he asked the question why.

OpenOCD was well received in my talks with Jason Kridner, Bill Gatliff, and
Michael Anderson.  In fact, Bill Gatliff jokingly suggested that I give a
OpenOCD class ... I don't think I'm the one to do such a thing but I think
all would agree that if such a class were offered ... there would be great
interest. All of the Linux Kernel or debugging related classes were full.
Michael Anderson's Debugging Device Drivers was the very last class of the
week and it was pretty much full while most had already left the conference
by that hour.

I have a BeagleBoard now :)

It was a good but busy week!

Regards,

Brian
