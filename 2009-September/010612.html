<PRE>Doc update:  mention how ARM's WFI instruction affects
JTAG clocking by gating the core clock, and workarounds.
Most details are with the &quot;halt&quot; command, which is one
of the first places this issue will be noticed.

<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openocd-development">+ at quotation</A> Warning
+On ARM cores, software using the @emph{wait for interrupt} operation
+often blocks the JTAG access needed by a @command{halt} command.
+This is because that operation also puts the core into a low
+power mode by gating the core clock;
+but the core clock is needed to detect JTAG clock transitions.
+
+One partial workaround uses adaptive clocking:  when the core is
+interrupted the operation completes, then JTAG clocks are accepted
+at least until the interrupt handler completes.
+However, this workaround is often unusable since the processor, board,
+and JTAG adapter must all support adaptive JTAG clocking.
+Also, it can't work until an interrupt is issued.
+
+A more complete workaround is to not use that operation while you

+Such loops can just remove that operation, at the cost of higher
