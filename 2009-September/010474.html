One issue I have with the ARM run_algorithm() stuff is that each
core has a separate *interface* ... the last param is core-specific,
not generic for all ARM cores.

So for example the src/flash/arm_nandwrite.c code can't be used
on ARMv6 or ARMv7 cores.  And there are various CFI utils that
can't be used either (for NOR flash).

Which means if you have some ARM algorithm, you need different
invocation code for ARMv4/ARMv5, ARMv6 (like arm1136), ARMv7, etc.
OR ... there's pretty dubious stuff going on there, where the
ARMv4/ARMv5 stuff is used as &quot;generic ARM&quot; even though there's
a bunch of stuff that should be core-specific.  Sorting all that
out could be messy; but the place to start is that &quot;arch_info&quot;
parameter.


Now, the arm11 stuff (is it arm1136-specific? or does it work for
other arm11 cores?) doesn't use that param.  But half the code in
its run_algorithm() method is commented out, Thumb isn't supported,
there's a big HACKHACKHACK comment up front, and so forth.  One
gets the feeling it's been used much yet!  So one thing to do is
just to address those obvious problems in the code.

Specific to the ARM1136 cores, I'm not sure the bulk_write()
method is as fast as it should be.  For ARMv4/ARMv5 there is
some DCC write code which seems to make a big difference; it
uses the run_algorithm() logic.  Doesn't NOR flash writing use
those bulk_write() paths?  Section 14.8.14 of the ARM1136
spec shows what is claimed to be a code sequence that's
optimized for fast writes.  I think something using the DCC
would be faster.  (Note:  DCC on 1136 differs from v4/v5.)
