<PRE>One of my goals w/OpenOCD is that it becomes yet another
thing that hardware vendors have to &quot;check off&quot; on the
GCC toolchain list. Not having OpenOCD support should
be like not having GDB support.

This is a long way off, but it's something to aspire to.

Short term(a year or so), I'd like to see robustness for
the ARM target *much* improved and the target library
become increasingly support more targets and support
them better. OpenOCD should be the best and cheapest
alternative (in terms of engineering &amp; marketing effort) for
ARM chip vendors. I'm not concerned about hardware cost
to developers, because putting an ft2232 on an eval
board costs $1, it doesn't get any cheaper...

It would be nice to have support for other targets than ARM,
and we're doing well w/MIPS, but we really need a significantly
bigger community or direct support from hardware vendors
(the gorillas get things for free, the chimps don't...) to
boast equally broad MIPS support as ARM support. Either
that or ARM support has to reach a point of maturity where
MIPS can start to catch up. Then again ARM is messier
than MIPS. PowerPC is hard because OpenOCD does not
have the leverage to pry open the NDAs that shroud the
PowerPC architecture so that gets to be a pain with open
source development.

In terms of getting levarage with smaller chip vendors,
I believe <A HREF="http://www.vinchip.com">http://www.vinchip.com</A> is a case in point, but
I have no idea if their 32 bit risc is just another ARM
or whether it's something proprietary(didn't really look).

Eventually I hope that we'll be able to identify some killer
features that closed source solutions just don't offer and
that it will become uneconomical to implement from scratch
for each JTAG debugger. I don't really know what those
features might be though. Some ideas:

- Threads support(e.g. eCos, FreeRTOS, etc. threads)
- Profiling support(??) there is profiling support in OpenOCD
now, but I haven't heard about anyone using it.
- Connect up to other GPL code. We're already connected
to GDB as much as we should be... What else?
- Killer FPGA soft CPU workflow support(not quite sure
what that means yet :-)
