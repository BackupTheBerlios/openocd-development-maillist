&gt;<i> Please wrap lines before 80 chars.
</I>
That is not so important right now - I can wrap them in the last step. 
Ignore that now [;

&gt;<i> And adopt _either_ uppercase or (preferred by me) lowercase
</I>&gt;<i> for the CHIPNAME symbols ...
</I>
For me that's fine to use lower case only, but some users might prefer 
lower case, some other - upper. By enforcing the use of only one of 
those, we should put some guidelines somewhere, and the reason would be 
&quot;just because&quot;, so why not use both? This way this script would work for 
lpc2103 and LPC2103 (which is the real name for that chip).

&gt;<i> It'd be a bit clearer to just default _CPUTAPID everywhere,
</I>&gt;<i> only overriding it for chips using older ARM7TDMI cores
</I>&gt;<i> (that's for rev 4 cores, as I understand; 0x3f1f0f0f for
</I>&gt;<i> the rev3 ones, etc).
</I>
I thougt about that, as in fact probably all LPC2xxx have exactly the 
same. It would be enough to allow some kind of override for that in case 
you'd need a change in that - i'll try to do that.

&gt;&gt;<i> # unknown LPC chip supplied to the script, use config for smallest chip available (LPC2101)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if { $__CHIPNAME == &quot;lpc2xxx&quot; } {
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why not just error out at this point if these five
</I>&gt;<i> variables (__CHIPNAME too!) aren't set?  Warn at least;
</I>&gt;<i> after checking for the &quot;no _ prefix&quot; versions of the
</I>&gt;<i> symbols.  (If a new LPC chip comes out tomorrow, it
</I>&gt;<i> should be usable in OpenOCD without needing to update
</I>&gt;<i> this config file.)
</I>
Actually I'd do that, but... I just don't know how to throw an error in 
TCL code. The &quot;TCL crash course&quot; in the guide is very simple, and I know 
nothing about TCL anyway. Any hint how to do that?

&gt;<i> Simplify:  no double-&quot;_&quot; prefixes should be needed
</I>&gt;<i> given a clean error exit earlier.  Though you might
</I>&gt;<i> want to &quot;set _FLASH_SIZE ''&quot; (etc) at top of file.
</I>
Generally those are here because of what is written above - I don't know 
how to throw an error in TCL scripts, that's where those &quot;three levels 
of variables&quot; came from.

&gt;<i> I don't like seeing &quot;trst_and_srst&quot; here since it's
</I>&gt;<i> possible that boards not wire both.  The &quot;pulls&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be a chip quirk though, thus belongs here
</I>&gt;<i> (worth a comment about that, though).
</I>
Maybe a possibility to override the default &quot;trst_and_srst&quot; would be 
just enough?

&gt;&gt;<i> # reset delays
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> jtag_nsrst_delay 100
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> jtag_ntrst_delay 100
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Those delays also don't seem to belong here.  If all boards
</I>&gt;<i> really need them because the LPC chips are odd, then add a
</I>&gt;<i> comment referencing the relevant issue from the data sheet.
</I>&gt;<i> Else strike them.
</I>
The board I have (LPC2103) doesn't work without it. It's probably 
because after reset the bootloader is in control and after it decides 
that JTAG can be enabled the interface is really enabled.

&gt;<i> (There's a certain amount of &quot;cargo cult
</I>&gt;<i> programming&quot; in the config files, and this looks like it's
</I>&gt;<i> in that category...)
</I>
Probably, but I have limited knowledge about what is really neccessary 
and what is not [;

&gt;<i> That should be &quot;_TARGETNAME (one underscore) to follow
</I>&gt;<i> the standard variable naming convention...
</I>
Explained above &lt;: (the error stuff)

&gt;<i> Since &quot;-endian little&quot; is not configurable, you don't need to
</I>&gt;<i> specify it (the default is little endian); don't.
</I>
sure.

&gt;<i> There is no &quot;arm7tdmi-s_r4&quot; variant in the current code; don't
</I>&gt;<i> specify that either.  (And if there were, I would not think
</I>&gt;<i> that *every* LPC chip uses the same revision.  Hasn't LPC2xxx
</I>&gt;<i> been around for a long time, predating that RTL revision?)
</I>
so what should that be? &quot;arm7tdmi-s&quot;?

&gt;<i> &quot;-chain-position $__TARGETNAME&quot; is wrong.  Target names and
</I>&gt;<i> TAP names should be separate namespaces; don't imply otherwise.
</I>&gt;<i> Just spell out &quot;-chain-position $_CHIPNAME.cpu&quot;
</I>
I was just following the way it is done now [; But when we do a 
revolution it's good to fix everything [;

&gt;<i> Don't configure &quot;-work-area-virt 0&quot; if there's no MMU support
</I>&gt;<i> (and hence no virtual memory).
</I>
If that's not obligatory, I'll remove that &lt;:

&gt;<i> It bothers me to specify &quot;all of SRAM&quot; for work area especially
</I>&gt;<i> combined with &quot;no backup&quot;.  If that's how those chips currently
</I>&gt;<i> are set up I suppose the LPC users are used to that unfriendly
</I>&gt;<i> behavior ... but I'd think a max of 4K or so, at the *end* of
</I>&gt;<i> SRAM, would usually suffice.
</I>
I just don't see any use for limiting that. Before flashing you reset 
the chip, the SRAM contents are gone anyway, so why preserve the random 
garbage that is there? The more RAM is used, the faster the download is.

I'll implement some more changes and post a new version of the file 
later, probably tomorrow. Still waiting for more suggestions.

BTW 1 - is there a way to check just a part of the string in TCL? For 
example I could set &quot;variant 1&quot; for all LPCs from LPC23* and LPC24* 
group instead of setting that for each of the chips. But that is the 
question of philosophy - the groups are fine, because everything that 
concerns ONE chip is in ONE place.

BTW 2 - I think it would be possible to create a &quot;chain&quot; like that for 
all existing targets. That would be good for end users, as now the cfg 
files are... well... complicated... By creating such chain, all &quot;magic&quot; 
would be hidden inside sth_internals.cfg and meaningful parameters 
(name, flash size, clock, etc) would be exposed for the users.

4\/3!!
