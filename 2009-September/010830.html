I don't see what you're getting at.  I looked at the datasheet for
the first chip in your patch, which says crystals can have quite a
range outside of the single 12 MHz option you provided.

Fixing this doesn't involve &quot;7 levels of abstraction&quot;.  Just give
the crystal setting the kind of &quot;if it's not provided&quot; check you
give other variables ... but error if it's not set.


&gt;<i> If the

</I>
Take those clock rate settings out of all the target-specific
files; probably leave a one-line comment listing the variable
name and saying the caller *must* set it appropriately for their
target board.

Add a few lines to the shared setup code which tests for that
variable.  If not set, emit a diagnostic and fail.  If set,
use it the way you now use it ... and to configure the JTAG
clock rate.

I think there will need to be some LPC2xxx-specific advice
somewhere, probably the user's guide.  If you like, I can
draft it.  It'd probably take the form of a sample &quot;openocd.cfg&quot;
file for someone with a custom LPC-based board, with the three
lines (source interface, set clock, source target/lpc); and the
suggestion that debug-oriented LPC builds add a delay right
after startup and before starting the clock, allowing JTAG to
attach before any &quot;real code&quot; runs.
