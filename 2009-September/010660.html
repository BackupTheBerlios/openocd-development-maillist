<PRE>I'll be there all week so I'll check out the vendors that are there and
report back with what I see.

Shoot me a email if anyone is planning on attending.  Would be cool to meet
some like minded folks.

It will be good to finally meet Dr. Miro Samek.  I stumbled over his work
back in 2004 and used it on a large project and can say it helped heard the
cats to speak a common language and allowed us to knock out some code (based
on hierarchical state machines)
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.state-machine.com/resources/glossary.htm#HSM">http://www.state-machine.com/resources/glossary.htm#HSM</A>&gt;in record time ...
and was instrumentable.  <A HREF="http://www.state-machine.com/">http://www.state-machine.com/</A>

I have a at91sam9260ek based board made by Embest (China).  Can't really
part with it but let me know what you need and maybe I can be your &quot;hands &amp;
feet&quot;.  Would also probably help me learn more ... I'm still coming up to
speed with debugging the Kernel and using Open Source tools after years of
commercial proprietary RTOS and debugger/JTAG tool use.

Regards,

Brian

&gt;<i> I think this post touches on a wide range of interesting subjects...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be interesting to hear if you see OpenOCD anywhere...
</I>&gt;<i> Could you report back what you see?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - What itch do the hardware/tool vendors have that OpenOCD could
</I>&gt;<i> scratch?
</I>&gt;<i> - Do hardware vendors love, hate or don't care about the idea
</I>&gt;<i> of OpenOCD?
</I>&gt;<i> - What type of hardware vendors care about OpenOCD? (&quot;Why the
</I>&gt;<i> hell would we want *another* JTAG debugger???&quot; is what I've heard
</I>&gt;<i> so far...)
</I>&gt;<i> - The OpenOCD foundation again: gather money and use them for
</I>&gt;<i> something that OpenOCD needs that isn't currently happening by
</I>&gt;<i> itself.
</I>&gt;<i> - What's OpenOCD's ultimate aspiration? My personal vision is that
</I>&gt;<i> OpenOCD becomes an inseparable part of the GCC toolchain for
</I>&gt;<i> embedded work, just like GDB is.
</I>&gt;<i> - What value do end users perceive of OpenOCD? Target library?
</I>&gt;<i> Cheap dongles? Open source support?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Zylin has taken the role of gathering a test target hardware, we have
</I>&gt;<i> a reasonable selection of hardware and just about as many hardware
</I>&gt;<i> target boards that we're willing to take for a quick spin. Really where
</I>&gt;<i> they are the most useful is when debugging a specific regression and
</I>&gt;<i> I need some specific hardware to reproduce the problem...
</I>&gt;<i> I should add a list to openocd svn w/most wanted hardware to be donated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone have an arm91sam9260 that they could donate btw?
