Various kinds of events yes, like branches, data access,
CPU state transitions and so on.  The exact events vary
between chips; and there's a *LOT* of attention spent on
how to limit the events that get recorded.  Without such
pre-filtering, there'd be too much data to use...

Should be pretty trivial to configure:  save *everything* into
a circular buffer, then dump it and ignore all but the last N
instruction events.

</I>
The way it's set up now is that you set things up, then
collect the data, and finally  dump it (or save it).
There's no GDB integration.  And I don't actually know
for sure that it all works, anyway.  Yet!  :)

There are quite a few commercial products which support
tracing; there's stuff to be learned by seeing what they
do.  I don't know that any integrate with their QEMU
analogues though ... the ones I know about seem to focus
on simulation for early development, or for providing
cycle-accurate timings in advance of tracing cycle counts
on the actual hardware.  For performance work, that is.
