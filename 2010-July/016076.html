<PRE>Moin,

Thanks for your warm welcome and comments.

As far as I can tell, current shortcomings are:
- no proper support of 24 bit memory
- misleading support of 8/16/32 bit memory width
- no support for memory spaces
- only 44 registers instead of 81 supported

&gt;<i> Aren't there potentially changes that would
</I>&gt;<i> be needed for GCC and GDB to support these cores?
</I>
That is beyond my scope, but here again, vendor sent
me the sources and I would be happy if anyone would
request from me them or host them for download.
I feel bad having them sit on my harddrive without
anyone but me being able to access these.

Besides, if someone decides to program DSP56300 in C,
he has probably chosen the wrong chip. So gcc for
dsp56300 is quite useless, especially the current
release that is based on version 1.37. Considering the
strange architecture with P:, X:, Y: and L: memory
accesses and 24/48/56 bit fractional data types with
inherent arithmetic saturation, I think it would be
extremely difficult to fully support that in C.

So I have no personal interest in GDB, I prefer to
use some old Motorola/Freescale tool called ads56300.
Freescale declined to provide the TCP protocol it
interacts with its command converter server, so I
hacked that meself and plan to use it with openocd.
No idea if such a thing could be part of official
openocd.

The main reason for me to do this is that I don't
want to depend on some very old parallel port probe
that seriously restricts my choice of computers.

So I assume my interest in openocd is a bit different
from other developers here that seem to be focused on
gcc/gdb and arm processors.

&gt;<i> Assuming that's true, contact those teams to

</I>&gt;<i> vendor what they've done along those lines, and what
</I>&gt;<i> they're willing to do...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I'll give it a try, but without much confidence.

Stefan
