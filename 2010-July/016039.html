<PRE>
&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; For the near future, I think the LM3S811-EK is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; likely to be that hardware.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is the code that it would run available?
</I>
Not yet (for SWD with OpenOCD) ... only for its
 JTAG mode (part of standard OpenOCD).


&gt;<i> --8&lt;-- LM3S811 Evaluation Board User's Manual
</I>&gt;<i> An FT2232 device from Future Technology Device
</I>&gt;<i> It looks like just another 2232 adapter.
</I>
Not &quot;just&quot; -- see the schematics, you'll notice
a bunch of wiring needed to support SWD as an
option in addition to JTAG.Some SWD signals are
bidirectional, so a pure JTAG adapter is
 not going to handle SWD too.

Other than the Luminary boards, I don't know of
any FT2232 based hardware with SWD support.


&gt;<i> Is the LM3S811 used to
</I>&gt;<i> implement the SWD you have in mind?
</I>
Not at all.  I mentioned that EK because it's
got a &quot;JTAG-or-SWD debug adapter&quot; mode, and is
the least expensive such product I've heard of.

The LM3S811 (and OLED display) are irrelevant in
terms of debug support for now.  Maybe someone will
come up with a fancier SWD adapter that OpenOCD can
support, with local intelligence.  Not unlike the
hardware for CodeRed's LPCXpresso thing.  Not on
my agenda, for sure. 

Or ... some inexpensive FT2232 adapter that does
not double as a Luminary devel board.  ;)
