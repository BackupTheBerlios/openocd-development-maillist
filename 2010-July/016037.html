Yeah. The LPC3154 chip is so big that I think it's likely that it
would be too much work to reverse engineer for that to be meaningful.
Better just get/make another adapter.

Maybe eventually we can reprogram the 3154 with something that is
useful with OpenOCD.


&gt;<i> But rest assured, that's on my list of stuff

</I>
It's a great target. I'd like to help, but would need a bite-size
chunk to work on. &quot;Get SWD working&quot; is definately too big.


&gt;<i> &gt; Alternatively, suggest me a simple and stupid adapter that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is likely to work with your SWD code, and I might get one.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the near future, I think the LM3S811-EK is

</I>
Is the code that it would run available? Maybe I can run that on some
other controller that I already have.


&gt;<i> $US 50 at Digi-Key, dual JTAG/SWD -- about what an Olimex-Tiny runs

</I>
I'm in Europe, so those suppliers aren't the best. I see now that I
could have added one of those to the order with the Xpresso board,
but too late since that order has already been shipped. :)


&gt;<i> (And there are other distributors for that EK too.)  I don't have
</I>&gt;<i> one myself (yet).
</I>
Well, the question is how it works. If we have some idea of how it
should be talking SWD then maybe we can make some simple firmware
for it, or even reuse Simon's firmware?


&gt;<i> I'd encourage patience until I commit some code
</I>&gt;<i> that starts to work with SWD.  Soonish, I hope...
</I>
No problem, but if you think that I can help then please say.
