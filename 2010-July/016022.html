<PRE>For those who have problems with libusb-win32 under 64bit
Windows Vista/7, this is the good news.

Also for those who prefers to use the open-source libftdi
over the proprietary ftd2xx with OpenOCD, this may be
good news as well.

Subject: libusb-win32 v1.2.0.0 released with signed driver
To: libusb-win32-devel AT lists.sourceforge.net


libusb-win32 v1.2.0.0 has been released. This is the first release with
a signed driver (using GlobalSign digital certificate). Now libusb0.sys
has the embedded signature and it can be used on x64 version of
Windows (eg: 64bit Windows Vista or Windows 7 which run on
Intel/AMD 64bit CPUs) machines which require signed driver.

When you use the inf wizard to generate the driver package,
you can install the driver package under 64bit Windows Vista
and Windows 7.

For those who want to pursue WHQL, you can sign the driver
package with a proper digital signature and go through the
necessary testing.

If you encounter problems with libusb-win32, please report
to the libusb-win32 mailing list for support. Thanks.


LibUsb-Win32 Change Log

V1.2.0.0 (07/07/2010)
=======================
* First signed driver release! The libusb-win32 kernel driver (libusb0.sys)
&#160;can now be used on x64 Windows machines that require signed drivers.

* Fixed 2128187 reported by Tim Green. usb_get_descriptor() can fail
&#160;because the given buffer of 8 bytes is too small.

* Fixed 2928293 reported by Tim Green. Sometimes the call to
&#160;usb_fetch_and_parse_descriptors() in usb_find_devices() can fail. This
&#160;patch moves the LIST_ADD to after a successful read of the device's
&#160;configuration descriptors.

* Fixed issue causing libusb-win32 to not act as power policy owner
&#160;when it should.

* Fixed issue in which on rare occasion, a libusb-win32 filter device could
&#160;run as a &quot;normal&quot; device.

* Fixed filter driver issue for device using wudfr.sys.

* Added large transfer splitting to driver (bulk, int, iso). NOTE:
&#160;The dll continues to break transfers in the same manner it always has.

In case you miss the older changelog, here they are.

V1.1.14.3 (06/12/2010)
=======================
* Remove get_configuration() request from usb_open(). &#160;This caused claim
&#160;interface to fail when used as a filter driver.

V1.1.14.0 (06/01/2010)
=======================
* Updated logging functions and standardized log message display format.

* Updated inf-wizard to use the new directory format for the libusb-win32
&#160;binaries.

* Updated package directories to reflect the winddk BUILDARCH env variable.
&#160;(i64 := ia64, x64 := amd64)

* Added request to get the current configuration in usb_open().

* Fixed 2960644 (reported by farthen) crash on shutdown with x64 based
&#160;systems while using inf files for each libusb device.

* Added additional log message only included in debug/chk builds.

* Updated default log levels to highest verbose level for debug builds.

* Added test signing support to the libusb-win32 make.cmd. This allows
&#160;libusb0.sys and libusb0.dll to be signed with a digital signature.
&#160;(see make.cmd for more details)

* Added MSVC 2008 project files

* Moved version defines to an include file (libusb_version.h)
&#160;This file is generated from libusb_version_h.in with &quot;make.cmd makever&quot;

* Removed all &quot;dist&quot; commands from cyg/mingw makefile. &#160;Instead use &quot;make.cmd&quot;
&#160;in the &quot;ddk_make&quot; directory.

* Fixed filter setup not running in 64bit mode

* Fixed 64bit inf-wizard, testlibusb-win builds

* Added set initial config value #1 when the driver is not a filter.
&#160;optionally, the initial configuration value can be specified in the inf
&#160;file: HKR,,&quot;InitialConfigValue&quot;,0x00010001,&lt;your config value&gt;

* Added support for querying device registry keys
&#160;(LIBUSB_IOCTL_GET_CUSTOM_REG_PROPERTY)

* Added support for querying device properties
&#160;(LIBUSB_IOCTL_GET_DEVICE_PROPERTY)

* Fixed possible race condition in kernel add_device()

* Updated default ddk build version number to 1.1.14.0 to facilitate
&#160;Microsoft WHQL submission.

* Added DDK build distribution system. &#160;Official libusb-win32 releases
&#160;(after 0.1.12.2) are built using Microsoft's WinDDK. &#160;(see make.cmd)

* Fixed 2658937 (reported by Tim Roberts) The libusb-win32 driver always
&#160;acts as a power policy owner.
