<PRE>Hello Vincent,

</I>Heh, I don't have a TRM next to my desk (but a drawing of the CPSR, the JTAG 
statemachine, and a few other pages I regularly look at ;)). While the bits 
are in the exact same order as the vectors (i.e. reset, undef, swi, ...), I 
agree that a convenience command for this useful feature is a nice addition.

I've just committed a new version that adds this as a new command
&quot;arm9tdmi vector_catch ['all'|'none'|'vector list']&quot;
based on your idea.

&gt;<i> &gt; The fault information handling could be used for both ARM926EJ-S and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ARM920T, but the ARM920T has separate data and instruction fault
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; registers. I'll check the TRMs for some other MMU enabled cores to see
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how much common functionality there is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ARM926 has 2 Fault Status Registers (IFSR and DFSR by setting opcode2 to 1
</I>&gt;<i> or 0 in mrc instruction) and one FAR.
</I>&gt;<i> Isn't it the same as 920t ?
</I>&gt;<i> But I implement my patch only for data abort (using DFSR) because FAR
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't give useful info for prefetch abort.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>The arm920t has two fault address registers, with separate instruction and 
data fault address registers.
I haven't had time to further look into this issue yet.

Regardig your other post (arm926ej-s cp15 command):
I was 100% confident that I had already added that patch, but obviously I 
forgot it. It's included in the newest commit. Thank you for the heads-up.

Regards,

Dominic
