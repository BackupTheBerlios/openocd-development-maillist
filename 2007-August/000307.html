I am aware of that there are already algorithms running on the target for most
of the supported flashes.

The idea I have is to create a virtual flash driver as a generic interface to feed data
to the target for processing via simple protocol running over DCC.
The algorithm could be loaded to the target as an image by script or simply by
hand for one shot operation.
This would be typically useful for programming some special memory not supported by
OpenOCD (e.g. serial data flash) without necessity to patch and recompile OpenOCD
because of a single usage of such exotic memory part.
All needed to do would be to program a simple target application receiving data by a defined protocol.

Another usage of this I can think of is feeding FPGA configuration data to the target (FPGA configured
by target in slave mode). I believe more situations like this may be found.

Note: I know that DCC is not available in every target but I have chosen this as probably the most
efficient way of communication with running target application. There may be also a &quot;shared memory&quot; mode
for targets not featuring DCC in the future.

What do you think about this idea? I will post this to the forum once it is fully functional.

BTW I am testing this on AT91SAM7.

&gt;&gt;<i> I have also added function embeddedice_handshake() which waits (with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> timeout) until the DCC is ready to receive (or send) the data.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In embeddedice_handshake() there's something I've wondered about:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 	if (hsbit == EICE_COMM_CTRL_WBIT)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 		hsact = 1;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 	else if (hsbit != EICE_COMM_CTRL_RBIT)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 		hsact = 0;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 	else
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 		return ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENTS;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If hsbit == ICE_COMM_CTRL_RBIT you're returning an error, because it's 
</I>&gt;<i> neither ...WBIT nor is it not ...RBIT. I guess that &quot;not equal&quot; was meant to 
</I>&gt;<i> be an &quot;equal&quot;?
</I>
Sure, you are right, of course. I swear I am never ever going to do such changes
to code late at night again ;-) Corrected.

Best regards,
   Pavel
