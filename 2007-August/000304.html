<PRE>Hello Pavel,

</I>We already have this in case of the LPC2000, STRxx and external flash, the 
only flash family that's not using an algorithm running on the target is 
AT91SAM7 afaict (not sure about the Cortex-M3 stuff, still haven't had time 
to look at it a bit closer). These families use the bulk_write support which 
uses DCC to transfer blocks of data to the target when there's a working area 
available.
I'll include the embeddedice_send because it'll be useful if we implement 
semihosting, but I'd like to know more about your semihosted flash loader and 
why you think it's necessary.

&gt;<i> I have also added function embeddedice_handshake() which waits (with
</I>&gt;<i> timeout) until the DCC is ready to receive (or send) the data.
</I>
In embeddedice_handshake() there's something I've wondered about:
&gt;<i>	if (hsbit == EICE_COMM_CTRL_WBIT)
</I>&gt;<i>		hsact = 1;
</I>&gt;<i>	else if (hsbit != EICE_COMM_CTRL_RBIT)
</I>&gt;<i>		hsact = 0;
</I>&gt;<i>	else
</I>&gt;<i>		return ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENTS;
</I>
If hsbit == ICE_COMM_CTRL_RBIT you're returning an error, because it's 
neither ...WBIT nor is it not ...RBIT. I guess that &quot;not equal&quot; was meant to 
be an &quot;equal&quot;?

&gt;<i> Also it seems to me that unnecessary to dynamically allocate
</I>&gt;<i> amounts of memory as small as 1 byte if the size is known at compile time,
</I>&gt;<i> so I have modified embeddedice_[receive,write_reg,read_reg_w_check] to use
</I>&gt;<i> local variables to fill in scan fields.
</I>&gt;<i> Even if the overhead of dynamic allocation is low in my opinion it is
</I>&gt;<i> a good idea to avoid such extreme situations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yeah, some of this code has historical reasons for looking the way it does, 
even if I don't remember why I wrote it that way in this particular case :)

&gt;<i> I propose this to be merged to SVN.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards,
</I>&gt;<i>    Pavel
</I>
Regards,

Dominic
