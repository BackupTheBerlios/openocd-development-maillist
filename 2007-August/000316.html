</I>Hi,

I have got the following from LMI about how to create a DCC channel using the Debug Core Register Data Register (DCRD):

&lt;quote&gt;

As you know, you can read and write memory. As you likely also know, the timing will be different when the target is running because AHB-AP 
is prioritized lower than the core in the bus matrix (cross bar). So, you get only the cycles not used by the core (AHB is pipelined, so the 
core can start its address cycle in the data cycle of an AHB-AP request). This is intended to remove time intrusion on the target. Many of 
the decisions were to remove intrusion. Obviously if you read or write a wait-stated memory location, then you may intrude on the target 
timing, but RAM accesses should not have this effect.

To replace the DCC concept, the intent was 2-fold:
1. You use the Debug Core Register Data Register (DCRD) as a communication and sync register. Since it can be read and written byte-wise, 
you can avoid read-modify-write problems. So, for example, the target side can use DCRC[7:0] (byte at 0xE000EDF8) for status, [15:8] (byte 
at 0xE000EDF9) for data, and the host can use [31:16] (half at 0xE000EDFA) for its control and data. This register is preferred because the 
host is polling the nearby register at 0xE000EDF0 for stop anyway (and if you set bank1 in AHB-AP, it is a single access to read each) and 
it does not generally have to contend with the core (unlike accessing SRAM).
2. Your side (Host) signals the core that you have asked for something or have data, using software triggering of an interrupt. You have a 
few built-in options, depending on goals. The Debug Monitor (int 12) was designed for RTOS agents, ROM monitors, test agents, etc. MON_PEND 
is used to signal it (priority decides when it gets woken). Note that you do not have to use MON_EN, so you can continue with halting debug, 
but use the monitor just for running behavior (MON_PEND only). Another option is PendSV (int 14), which can be used if not used by the app. 
It is triggered by a write to PENDSVSET. This wakes it up when pri allows (of course); it is intended for certain RTOSes to use for ISR to 
OS sync; but not used by more basic RTOSes.
The purpose of the host signaling is to avoid polling on the target.

The normal sequence is that the host is polling the status to see if the target has stopped and also if there is a message (status in DCRD). 
If a message, the host can support it. If the host wants to send a message to the target, it can either write a small (2 byte) message to 
the target in DCRD and then signal (e.g. MON_PEND or PENDSVSET), or write a bigger message in memory somewhere and then signal.

&lt;/endquote&gt;

Regards,
Magnus
