<PRE>Hello Dominic,

</I>
This is true. I made it so to minimize changes because current version of OpenOCD
accepts just one GDB connection (?).

Note: I am not sure whether multiple GDB connections can live at the same time
(whether it makes sense at all) because of semantics of GDB protocol and target control.
When target is halted, GDB host has complete control over the stub - actively sends packets
and expects replies. However when the target is running the GDB host play rather passive role
waiting for stop reply (and other) packets. If the GDB host sends a packet and the target
halts at the same time there is a conflict resulting in an error
(OpenOCD expects + as confirmation of stop reply packet and receives $ as new packet header instead)
- I have already noticed this issue before.
If multiple GDB connections control the target this problem arises,
and there is probably no simple solution for this, because of nature of GDB protocol.

&gt;<i> - The GDB documentation only guarantees that vFlash sections don't overlap, 
</I>&gt;<i> and that they're sent for increasing addresses, but it doesn't say that there 
</I>&gt;<i> can't be gaps.
</I>
Sure, I noticed that and omitted this for now for simplicity. It should not be hard to fix this.

&gt;<i> I think it's better to build an image_t object with the 
</I>&gt;<i> vFlashWrite parts. The flash_write function could then just take an image_t 
</I>&gt;<i> pointer, and is then useable for both the GDB code and the &quot;flash write&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> command.
</I>
Ok, good idea I will look at that. Right now flash_write is just a wrapper for
write function of corresponding flash driver.

&gt;<i> - On errors you reply with &quot;E nn&quot; - the documentation lists it with a space in 
</I>&gt;<i> between, those spaces aren't part of an actual reply - I don't know if your 
</I>&gt;<i> application is expecting &quot;E&lt;space&gt;nn&quot;, but I don't think GDB could live with 
</I>&gt;<i> that.
</I>
Ok, I am not that familiar with GDB internals, and just made it according to
docs. Let's make it the right (GDB) way.

Best regards,
   Pavel
