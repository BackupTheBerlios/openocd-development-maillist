<PRE>Hi all,

  Sorry for my ignorance on ARM platform. Is semi-hosting means feeding
instructions and data to CPU and let it runs on target CPU?
  I am planning to add MIPS support on OpenOCD. And my mips4kc core only support
 &quot;Processor Access&quot; instead of &quot;DMA mode&quot;. &quot;Processor Access&quot; is a mode that
supply instructions and data to the CPU the let it performs further internal
registers access and memory access. I think it is similar to semi-hosting you
meant.
  If you are going to add such framework for semi-hosting. I would follow the
design as much as possible.

Best Regards
David T.L. Wong

&gt;<i> Hello Dominic and the list,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> here is a working draft of generic on-chip loader I created, if anyone is
</I>&gt;<i> interested.
</I>&gt;<i> (see the quotation below for context).
</I>&gt;<i> I am looking forward to hear any comments, improvements or objections.
</I>&gt;<i> Even if it is not added to the repository some user might find this useful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have attached an example of a loader which does flashing of at91sam7x,
</I>&gt;<i> however, this is just an example, it would be better to have support for
</I>&gt;<i> semi-hosted flashing of at91sam7x included directly in OpenOCD.
</I>&gt;<i> My aim was to create generic interface as simple as possible,
</I>&gt;<i> for feeding the data to the target, it might not be directly related
</I>&gt;<i> to flash memory belonging to the target.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also thought about &quot;shared memory&quot; communication method
</I>&gt;<i> do you think this would be a good/better idea that direct usage of DCC?
</I>&gt;<i> (DCC should be more efficient in theory, he question is how significant role
</I>&gt;<i> this plays
</I>&gt;<i> in overall speed)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pavel
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am aware of that there are already algorithms running on the target
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the supported flashes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The idea I have is to create a virtual flash driver as a generic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interface to feed data
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the target for processing via simple protocol running over DCC.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The algorithm could be loaded to the target as an image by script or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; simply by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hand for one shot operation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This would be typically useful for programming some special memory not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; supported by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; OpenOCD (e.g. serial data flash) without necessity to patch and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recompile OpenOCD
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because of a single usage of such exotic memory part.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; All needed to do would be to program a simple target application
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; receiving data by a defined protocol.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Another usage of this I can think of is feeding FPGA configuration data
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the target (FPGA configured
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by target in slave mode). I believe more situations like this may be found.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Note: I know that DCC is not available in every target but I have chosen
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this as probably the most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; efficient way of communication with running target application. There
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; may be also a &quot;shared memory&quot; mode
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for targets not featuring DCC in the future.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What do you think about this idea? I will post this to the forum once it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is fully functional.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
