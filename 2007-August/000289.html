Hello Dominic,

Dominic Rath napsal(a):
&gt;&gt;<i> the flash_write() function in revision 195 is broken and stucks in an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> infinite loop. Well, flash_write() function became too complex so that it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it not clear how it behaves at a glance.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I only briefly tested it but so far it was working fine for me. I'll run some 
</I>&gt;<i> more tests. All current revisions should be considered experimental because 
</I>&gt;<i> of the large number of changes.
</I>&gt;<i> There'll be no enhancements during the near future from my side, and I hope to 
</I>&gt;<i> stabilize the recent changes in the next few days.
</I>
The problem is on line 803 which reads:
if (thissection_size &lt; thisrun_size)
The problem arises when the rest of the section is to be written in a single run,
in which case thisrun_size equals thissection_size.
It should read if (thissection_size &lt;= thisrun_size)

&gt;<i> Agreed. I always had the GDB example in mind where sections are guaranteed to 
</I>&gt;<i> be in increasing order, and the ELF files I looked at had the sections sorted 
</I>&gt;<i> that way, too, but you're right that this order isn't always guaranteed.
</I>
I would like to polish flash_write() a bit if you agree,
add handling of images with out of order sections and to make it a bit transparent
in what it does (maybe by using some subroutines if needed). I may look at this tomorrow

&gt;<i> The merging in flash_write was added after I realized that flashing fails for 
</I>&gt;<i> the LPC otherwise. Basically the merging in image_add_section shouldn't be 
</I>&gt;<i> necessary anymore, but I doubt the cost of memory reallocation matters on 
</I>&gt;<i> todays machines.
</I>
Well, yes and no, creating large images by adding small pieces (size of GDB packet is limited)
in theory, the reallocation may result in copying the whole image every time a piece is added,
however this shall not happen unless there are other allocations between calls to realloc.
