Hello Dominic and the list!

I have made some work on flash_write() function:

Number of nested loops reduced to just 2 by concatenating just sections which
at least partly fall into the same bank as the first section in the run,
I hope this would make the code more readable.

I finally decided not to sort the sections by address inside flash_write()
as we discussed, but there is a test and a warning if a section is out of order.
I believe that sorting of sections is rather job for some image handling function -
there may be image sorting function in the future.
The same applies to empty sections, a warning is issued in such case.

&quot;image_size&quot; was renamed to &quot;written&quot; as it indicates amount of data successfully written to the flash,
skipped sections (i.e. RAM sections) are not taken into account.

Pointer parameter &quot;u32 *failed&quot; changed to &quot;int *failed&quot;, so that the array
the error code returned by flash driver may be stored for each section directly (possible future improvement).
(the patch includes changes in other functions reflecting this)

Pointer parameters written, err_str, failed are considered optional and may be NULL.

Bugs in flash_write () in revision 195 fixed by this patch:
- may stuck in an infinite loop if section was to be skipped because of no corresponding bank was found. (line 779).
- memory leak on line 799 (buffer not freed before return)
- the test on line 803 should be &lt;= (less than or equal) otherwise there may be an infinite loop

I hope this patch is helpful and without conflicts.

Best Regards,

Pavel
