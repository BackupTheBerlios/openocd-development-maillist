<PRE>Hello Pavel,

I've finally had time to look at your patch.

There are a few problems with it, but I'm currently working on fixing these:
- a global buffer for vflash data isn't a good idea. There could be multiple 
GDB connection, each carrying out flash operations. This data belongs to a 
connection, so I made it a member of gdb_connection_t
- The GDB documentation only guarantees that vFlash sections don't overlap, 
and that they're sent for increasing addresses, but it doesn't say that there 
can't be gaps. I think it's better to build an image_t object with the 
vFlashWrite parts. The flash_write function could then just take an image_t 
pointer, and is then useable for both the GDB code and the &quot;flash write&quot; 
command.
- On errors you reply with &quot;E nn&quot; - the documentation lists it with a space in 
between, those spaces aren't part of an actual reply - I don't know if your 
application is expecting &quot;E&lt;space&gt;nn&quot;, but I don't think GDB could live with 
that.

Regards,

Dominic

&gt;<i> Hello list,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> here is a patch for support of vFlash* commands.
</I>&gt;<i> Supported commands are vFlashErase, vFlashWrite, vFlashDone.
</I>&gt;<i> Command qXfer:memory-map:read:: is not supported yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The patch includes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -- flash.[ch] --
</I>&gt;<i> These functions lookup flash bank by address and perform erase/write on it:
</I>&gt;<i> int flash_erase(u32 addr, u32 length);
</I>&gt;<i> int flash_write(u8 *buffer, u32 addr, u32 length);
</I>&gt;<i> flash_bank_t *get_flash_bank_by_addr(u32 addr);
</I>&gt;<i> The erase/write region may not span multiple banks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -- gdb_server.c --
</I>&gt;<i> added function gdb_v_packet() for handling vFlash* commands.
</I>&gt;<i> vFlashErase calls flash_erase() immediately, while vFlashWrite
</I>&gt;<i> stores data to dynamically reallocated buffer. vFlashDone commits
</I>&gt;<i> the whole buffer by calling flash_write().
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -- at91sam7.c --
</I>&gt;<i> at91sam7_probe() did not set bank-&gt;num_sectors, now it sets
</I>&gt;<i> num_sectors=1, as only bulk erase of the whole chip is supported by
</I>&gt;<i> at91sam7 flash driver (so there is only a single erase sector spanning
</I>&gt;<i> whole device).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> at91sam7_erase() checked last sector to be erased against number of
</I>&gt;<i> lockbits, which is wrong, as the erase sectors are not completely related
</I>&gt;<i> to lockbits and moreover, only a single erase sector is supported (see
</I>&gt;<i> above). This is corrected so that last is checked againts
</I>&gt;<i> bank-&gt;num_sectors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also include complete file at91sam7.c, which is reformatted (trimmed
</I>&gt;<i> trailing spaces at end of lines, unified indentation using tabs etc. -
</I>&gt;<i> cosmetic changes). I recommend to place it to HEAD revision - the original
</I>&gt;<i> one contains a lot of formatting issues like this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>    Pavel
