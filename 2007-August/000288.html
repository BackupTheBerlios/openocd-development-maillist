<PRE>Hello Pavel,

</I>I only briefly tested it but so far it was working fine for me. I'll run some 
more tests. All current revisions should be considered experimental because 
of the large number of changes.
There'll be no enhancements during the near future from my side, and I hope to 
stabilize the recent changes in the next few days.

&gt;<i> I am going to fix this issue, but before that, I would like to ask for some
</I>&gt;<i> opinions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) The flash_write() function is trying to merge consecutive sections.
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure if this is necessary - anyway, the way it does it
</I>&gt;<i> is not really perfect, the sections need not to appear in order of
</I>&gt;<i> increasing addresses.
</I>
Merging of consecutive sections is necessary, otherwise flash writing fails on 
the LPC2000. Here's part of the objdump output from a simple LED blinking 
example that runs in the internal flash of a LPC2294:

Sections:
Idx Name          Size      VMA       LMA       File off  Algn
  0 .text         000002f4  00000000  00000000  00008000  2**2
                  CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, READONLY, CODE
  1 .data         00000018  40000200  000002f4  00010200  2**2
                  CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, DATA
  2 .bss          0000001c  40000218  40000218  00010218  2**2
                  ALLOC

The text section ranges from 0x0 to 0x2f3, immediately followed by the data 
section that's loaded to 0x2f4 and then relocated by startup code to 
0x40000200. The IAP functions implemented in the LPC2000 bootloader require 
flash writes to be aligned to 256 or 512 byte boundaries. While this could be 
worked around, the LPCs flash architecture further CRCs every 16 bytes, 
making it impossible to change less than that amount.
The LPC2000 code pads the last block up to the minimum size and alignment with 
0xff, but for this it needs to know when that last block is to be flashed.

&gt;<i> 2) If merging of sections in flash_write is really necessary for some
</I>&gt;<i> reason, I think it might be a good idea to do it the right way, not relying
</I>&gt;<i> on their order.
</I>
Agreed. I always had the GDB example in mind where sections are guaranteed to 
be in increasing order, and the ELF files I looked at had the sections sorted 
that way, too, but you're right that this order isn't always guaranteed.

&gt;<i> 3) If 2) is done, is it still necessary to merge data to existing last
</I>&gt;<i> section in image.c image_add_section()? I think rather not as it only
</I>&gt;<i> brings overhead of memory reallocation.
</I>
The merging in flash_write was added after I realized that flashing fails for 
the LPC otherwise. Basically the merging in image_add_section shouldn't be 
necessary anymore, but I doubt the cost of memory reallocation matters on 
todays machines.

&gt;<i> 4) If 2) is done, how do we handle overlapping sections? I suppose the
</I>&gt;<i> correct way is to issue an error.
</I>
I can't think of an example where sections would legitimately overlap, and I 
wouldn't know how to write them to flash anyway, so yes, an error should be 
issued.

&gt;<i> 5) If the image contains a section with address not assigned to any of the
</I>&gt;<i> flash banks, the section is marked as failed, but no error is returned. Why
</I>&gt;<i> does it behave this way, is this because of sections which shall go to RAM?
</I>
Right. I don't have an example ready, but when I wrote that code I thought 
about images that specify sections both in Flash and in RAM. I didn't find it 
reasonable to completely fail the flashing process, so I decided to list the 
failing sections.

&gt;<i> I am looking forward for you opinions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Pavel
</I>
Best regards,

Dominic

&gt;<i> Dominic Rath napsal(a):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've just committed my latest changes that include the various patches
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sent during the last few days and a few enhancements.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've started reworking the Presto support to allow use with both FTD2XX
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and libftdi on both Windows and Linux/*BSD. Currently only the FTD2XX
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; variant is working for me, and it only finds the device at about every
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; third attempt, but the FTD2XX functionality didn't change, so I suppose
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it'll work OK on windows.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The libftdi variant fails with a usb_bulk_write error, I'll have to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; further investiagte this problem when I find some time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Compilation worked for both Linux and windows (i586-mingw32msvc).
