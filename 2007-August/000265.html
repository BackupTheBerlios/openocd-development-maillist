Hi All,

&gt;<i> - Writing to flash:
</I>&gt;<i> One problem here is that mutliple flash banks defined in a .cfg file don't 
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily belong to a common address space. There could be mutliple 
</I>&gt;<i> targets, each with its own flashes, and therefor multiple address spaces.
</I>
True - it is definitely a good idea to know the target each bank belongs to, as you proposed below.

&gt;<i> The one thing that we probably don't have to care about is one flash that 
</I>&gt;<i> belongs to multiple targets - not sure if there are dual-port flashes anyway, 
</I>&gt;<i> but even then it's hardly necessary for a debugger to be able to access that 
</I>&gt;<i> flash from two targets.
</I>
I agree on that, this is hardly necessary.

&gt;<i> Currently, flash is accessible only on a per-bank scheme. The &quot;flash&quot; commands 
</I>&gt;<i> all take the bank number as their first argument. The flash drivers expect 
</I>&gt;<i> addresses relative to the base of the flash, i.e. only an offset within the 
</I>&gt;<i> flash. While merging Pavel's vFlash* work I realized that this simple scheme 
</I>&gt;<i> wont work when we're writing to absolute addresses inside a target's address 
</I>&gt;<i> space. This is what GDB's vFlashWrite does, and images written to flash are 
</I>&gt;<i> similar, because any image could easily span multiple, non-consecutive flash 
</I>&gt;<i> banks.
</I>&gt;<i> For GDB's vFlash to work we definitely need a way to know which flash bank we 
</I>&gt;<i> want to write to. This means we need a way of knowing which target a bank 
</I>&gt;<i> belongs to, which could be achieved by moving the target field from the 
</I>&gt;<i> driver-private structure to the common flash bank structure.
</I>
That is exactly the problem I was facing, finally I have chosen a simple way -
just to lookup flash bank according given address like if all were in the same address
space. This is not a perfect solution in theory, but works well in a typical situation.

The approach I took:
The 32-bit virtual address space is huge (when speaking about MCUs) and 
even if some flash bank is in fact not part of the targets address space, it may be
mapped into some unused range in this address space (for programming purposes).
In my opinion, this is not a significant limitation for practical usage and we can live with that
before there is a better solution.

&gt;<i> The question is what the user interface should look like. Do we want to be 
</I>&gt;<i> able to access flash both on a per-target and on a per-bank basis? If we want 
</I>&gt;<i> to keep the ability of supporting flashes without a target we still need the 
</I>&gt;<i> per-bank access, but the per-target access seems more natural for writing 
</I>&gt;<i> images. Opinions on this topic are highly welcome.
</I>
See above, mapping such flashes to the address space of some target is a satisfactory solution in praxis.

Maybe a silly question:
By the way, what about Harvard architectures? I am not aware how OpenOCD/GDB handles that
as I am not familiar with ARM9 yet - just started with ARM7 which is a Neumann.

Best Regards,
  Pavel
