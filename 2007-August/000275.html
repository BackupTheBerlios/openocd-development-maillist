<PRE>Hi List,

I've commited a large stack of changes that's been piling up in my local tree. 
R191 fixes a problem I encountered when trying to compile for MinGW (finally 
figured out how to tell autotools to build MinGW executables on my Ubuntu 
machine), and R192 updates the version information because of some 
incompatible changes.

The user visible differences are:
- 'flash write' is now deprecated, but still works as before
- 'flash write_binary &lt;bank&gt; &lt;file&gt; &lt;offset&gt;' writes a plain binary to a given 
flash bank
- 'flash write_image &lt;file&gt; [offset] [type]' writes an image to the current 
target's flash.

For this to work it was necessary to make the target_t* a member of the 
flash_bank_t itself, not the driver-specific structure. The flash bank 
configuration for lpc2000 and str7x was therefor changed, because the target 
is now a required argument for all flashes.

#flash bank lpc2000 &lt;base&gt; &lt;size&gt; 0 0 &lt;target#&gt; &lt;variant&gt; &lt;cclk&gt; 
[calc_checksum]
#flash bank str7x &lt;base&gt; &lt;size&gt; 0 0 &lt;target#&gt; &lt;variant&gt;

If we have to deal with flashes that have no associated target we'll probably 
have to come up with some workaround, but for now this should be fine.

I've also changed the ELF handling to use the physical address instead of the 
virtual address - in objdump those values are reported as the VMA and LMA, 
and when building a image in flash, the .data section got assigned an VMA in 
RAM while the LMA is in flash, which is what we want when writing the image 
to flash.

I've kept the change that prevents the BSS section to be loaded.

There's a problem when writing an image to a LPC2000 if the sections aren't 
aligned to the minimum IAP alignment (512 in case of my LPC2294). I'll change 
the code to merge consecutive sections when writing to flash to work around 
this problem.

The checkins also add a new &quot;target_request&quot; subsystem that uses some kind of 
sideband-channel like the ARM7/9 DCC to communicate with the target while 
it's running. For now this supports &quot;tracepoints&quot;, i.e. the target simply 
tells the debugger it passed a certain point, and &quot;debug messages&quot; that use 
the DCC to print debug information on the host. In the future this could be 
enhanced to support semihosting. In order to be able to react to target 
requests in a timely manner, a new timer polls the target every milisecond 
(i.e. as fast as possible) - this could have a negative impact on the host 
performance, and might need further consideration.

Best regards,

Dominic
