</I>I know of at least one user who's debugging multiple LPC2000 devices on a 
single board that are part of the same JTAG chain. All of those targets will 
have their flash mapped to the same address. This might be a corner case, but 
it's definitely possible.

</I>
While ARM9 is a hardvard architecture hardware wise (separate busses for 
instruction and data memory) both memories are usually accessible from either 
bus, though ocassionally with performance penalties. From a programmers 
perspective the ARM9s usually appear as a von-Neumann machine.
Anyway, if flash programming is possible at all from within the target there 
needs to be a way to access the flash via the data bus, therefor we're only 
concerned with one address space, even if they're actually separate.
