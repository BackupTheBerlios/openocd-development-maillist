Hello Dominic and everyone on the list,

the flash_write() function in revision 195 is broken and stucks in an
infinite loop. Well, flash_write() function became too complex so that it
it not clear how it behaves at a glance.

I am going to fix this issue, but before that, I would like to ask for some opinions:

1) The flash_write() function is trying to merge consecutive sections.
I am not sure if this is necessary - anyway, the way it does it
is not really perfect, the sections need not to appear in order of increasing addresses.

2) If merging of sections in flash_write is really necessary for some reason,
I think it might be a good idea to do it the right way, not relying on their order.

3) If 2) is done, is it still necessary to merge data to existing last section in
image.c image_add_section()? I think rather not as it only brings overhead of memory
reallocation.

4) If 2) is done, how do we handle overlapping sections? I suppose the correct way is to
issue an error.

5) If the image contains a section with address not assigned to any of the flash banks,
the section is marked as failed, but no error is returned. Why does it behave this way,
is this because of sections which shall go to RAM?

I am looking forward for you opinions.

&gt;<i> I've just committed my latest changes that include the various patches sent 
</I>&gt;<i> during the last few days and a few enhancements.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've started reworking the Presto support to allow use with both FTD2XX and 
</I>&gt;<i> libftdi on both Windows and Linux/*BSD. Currently only the FTD2XX variant is 
</I>&gt;<i> working for me, and it only finds the device at about every third attempt, 
</I>&gt;<i> but the FTD2XX functionality didn't change, so I suppose it'll work OK on 
</I>&gt;<i> windows.
</I>&gt;<i> The libftdi variant fails with a usb_bulk_write error, I'll have to further 
</I>&gt;<i> investiagte this problem when I find some time.
</I>&gt;<i> Compilation worked for both Linux and windows (i586-mingw32msvc).
