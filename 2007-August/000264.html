<PRE>Hi,

took me a while to find some time to think about and reply to these issues:

- Clearing BSS:
I'm don't think this is the OpenOCD's (or any other debugger's) job. Zeroing 
BSS is part of the C startup, just like copying .data, setting up argc and 
argv, preparing an initial stack frame, etc.
When loading an image to RAM the OpenOCD of course copies .data, but even 
then it's the startup code's job to prepare the stack etc.
I find it reasonable to expect the startup code to clear out BSS in any case.

- Writing to flash:
One problem here is that mutliple flash banks defined in a .cfg file don't 
necessarily belong to a common address space. There could be mutliple 
targets, each with its own flashes, and therefor multiple address spaces.
The idea when creating the flash subsystem was that there could also be flash 
without an associated target, e.g. configuration flash for FPGAs, with their 
own JTAG port, and consequently not mapped into any address space (well, 
maybe one relative to itself).
The one thing that we probably don't have to care about is one flash that 
belongs to multiple targets - not sure if there are dual-port flashes anyway, 
but even then it's hardly necessary for a debugger to be able to access that 
flash from two targets.

Currently, flash is accessible only on a per-bank scheme. The &quot;flash&quot; commands 
all take the bank number as their first argument. The flash drivers expect 
addresses relative to the base of the flash, i.e. only an offset within the 
flash. While merging Pavel's vFlash* work I realized that this simple scheme 
wont work when we're writing to absolute addresses inside a target's address 
space. This is what GDB's vFlashWrite does, and images written to flash are 
similar, because any image could easily span multiple, non-consecutive flash 
banks.

For GDB's vFlash to work we definitely need a way to know which flash bank we 
want to write to. This means we need a way of knowing which target a bank 
belongs to, which could be achieved by moving the target field from the 
driver-private structure to the common flash bank structure.
The question is what the user interface should look like. Do we want to be 
able to access flash both on a per-target and on a per-bank basis? If we want 
to keep the ability of supporting flashes without a target we still need the 
per-bank access, but the per-target access seems more natural for writing 
images. Opinions on this topic are highly welcome.

Regards,

Dominic
