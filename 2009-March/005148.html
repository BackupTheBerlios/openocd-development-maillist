<PRE>Hi list

I just have had enough free time to check out my STM32-P103 boards,
( and update from a version of OpenOCD that was  current a year  and a 
half ago,  my head spins :) )

My understanding of why the STM32 flash  write is slow is as follows:

    - flash write uses  run_algorithm that saves and restores all core 
registers, for every block 8k/16k written

    - Saving and restoring core registers is done one register at a 
time, incurring a lot of USB overhead

    - Saving and writing core registers always saves and then restores  
DCB_DCRDR

    - swjdp_transaction_endcheck(swjdp_common_t *swjdp) has one extra 
call to jtag_execute_queue()
This was added because of some problems that I think are related to 
reset handling and jtag commands sent by reset code
and not from the cortex swjdp module.

So the way to improve flash writing, and perhaps also debug, single step 
speed:

- Increase buffer size, this helps but RAM is limited

- Try to remove the extra jtag_execute_queue() call in 
wjdp_transaction_endcheck

- Make the read and writes of DCB_DCRDR in ahbap_read_coreregister_u3 
and ahbap_write_coreregister_u3 nonatomic, ie part of a single transaction.
If the transaction failes then DCC communications is broken anyway.

- Do save and restore of several core registers in a single transaction 
with values in an array of u32 and controlled by a bitmask
This should improve all debug start/stop/singlestep performance

- Use a more sofisticated write algoritm that has two RAM buffers on the 
target, and where OpenOCD fills one while the algorithm code is flashing 
the other.
This works on Cortex-M3 since OpenOCD can write to RAM while the target 
is running the algorithm.
This is requires more complicated target algoritm and interaction bewwen 
host and taget while the algorithm is running.

I have tested the first three suggestions above, the simple ones, and 
get 15kB/s for a 37kB file, and nothing seems broken

Comments ?? 

Regards
Magnus
