<PRE>*NOTE* - I have broken this item (jtag.h state changes) out as a 
seperate subject item so it can be tracked a bit better (I hope anyway)

duane&gt;  2)  jtag/jtag.h. changing state numbers concerns me - but i see

jeff&gt; I chalk this narrow window to being normal for a new part.

I don't know yet.  That's really just a &quot;well known rev4 arm chip&quot;. 
Sure, it is a new zigbee wireless part from FreeScale - but &quot;the arm 
part&quot; has been around for quite some time. The ARM7TDMI TRM r4p1, if 
understand arm nomenclature, means &quot;rev 4 - product #1&quot; - has a 
copyright date of 2001 (1st release, maintenance updates in 2001 and 
2004). I doubt the &quot;arm part has changed any&quot; - I could be wrong.

My hunch is far more *THUMB* problems then dongle problems.

peter&gt; There is a note somewhere (I think above the original version of 
the table)  that says it's the adapter code's job to catch 
xxSHIFT-&gt;xxSHIFT transitions  and treat them differently, but we 
shouldn't do the wrong thing anyway.

Hmm yes, I remember seeing that too..

peter&gt; There are also adapters (at least one - USBprog) that rely on the 
fact that there are exactly 7 state transitions in every tms sequence. 
This is not immutable, but it will need coordination and  will have to 
change if OpenOCD does.

rick&gt; [snip/out of context] Every single adapter OpenOCD supports is 
just fed a stream of bytes indicating the pin states for the next cycle. 
[snip]

Ignoring &quot;what the dongle driver code wants or needs&quot; - what rick says 
seems like &quot;the right abstract/architectural thing to do&quot; and that 
should be the design principle we use, nothing less. Dongles need to do 
what they are told.

-Duane.
