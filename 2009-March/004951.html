</I>&gt;<i> Good catch! As always, RTFM :)

</I>&gt;<i> I set the signal analyzer to catch the condition that you described ((rising TCK) and (high RTCK)). See attached screenshot. This was with TCK set to 5 kHz. As several people pointed out, TCK (jtag_khz) is too fast.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Yes, I know, I have done battery powered consumer electronics for 
*YEARS* and had to be very careful about what type of jtag box we used. 
That's why I wrote that FAQ.

FYI the new &quot;ftdi2232H&quot; is suppose to support RTCK.  The Segger JLINK is 
suppose to support RTCK. Another good Jtag box is the Zylin10000 
(<A HREF="http://www.zylin.com/zy1000.html">http://www.zylin.com/zy1000.html</A>).

Previously [at old company] I used an expensive Majic jtag box from EPI 
TOOLS [now owned by Mentor Graphics].

Once you have a jtag dongle that supports RTCK, these problems will go 
away - because the dongle will auto-adapt. Meanwhile, you must use the 
poor mans hack :-(

&gt;<i> P.S.S. I have a second hand Janatek / Jobmatch Systems Lu-La-Usb Logic Analyzer (www.janatek.co.za).
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
I purchased one of these:   <A HREF="http://www.usbee.com/sx.html,">http://www.usbee.com/sx.html,</A>  problem is it 
is a 3.3V only part :-(  - beagle board is 1.8V  grrr I'm making an 
adapter...  The &quot;SX&quot; is actually just a simple Cypress FX2 chip - 
programed from the PC. The other nasty ness of this device is it uses 
the &quot;cypress fx2 driver from cypress&quot; - which I have personal experience 
with. The kindest words I can use are this: That cypress driver *F*ing 
*S*ks.   The price was right..

-Duane.
