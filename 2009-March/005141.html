<PRE>Hi there

My problem is very simple : flashing a 100Kbytes u-boot takes around 6hours
!!!

It was 12 hours before I played with ft2232_latency (from 2 to 4 msecs), but
I can't find any other improvment

As there is no DMA access on my SOC, I'm using pracc mode, which mean
downloading ~30 instructions per read/write. However I read people that
flashed 256K in 40 minutes in this mode.

I also had to modify wait_for_pracc_rw so that it loops until access bit is
set (2 reads instead of one). I thought at the beginning that it was due to
36 bits address width (and that was my first question) but nope!

Configuration :
- openocd, built from source using an svn extract from 1st march,
- amontec jtagkey (not tiny) bought in february
- target with a AU1200 chip (with mips4k SOC) @500Mhz
- host is an ubuntu platform, kernel 2.6.27-12
- oldtimer (AMD Athlon XP 3000) and newborn (Intel Pentium DualCore @ 2GHz)
= no change

As I'm lost without any clue on how to improve flashing speed, I wonder if
anyone has encountered so hard conditions before?

Can anyone help me on this?

Also, however the speed, I'm thinking on some improvment. Each time a
read/write is perfomed, the asm code is &quot;downloaded&quot; in ejtag pracc stack
space. I wonder when and if this space is cleared. Could it be possible that
all code is downloaded, and that pracc instructions are simply &quot;branch&quot;?
(Sorry to be stupid if it's impossible but I'm no ejtag specialist)

Fab
