<PRE>After months of hard work I am forced to abandon all work on the OpenOCD
support for the Micronas ARM7TDMI devices.
I had stopped it at one time but later restarted. Micronas was not very
helpfull but they have some nice devices.

They announced last week that following the layoffs and decision of
Spansion to eliminate the flash devices that they use in their
microcontrollers they will discontinue all the Flash based ARM devices
that they manufacture. All those of us who designed with these parts are
getting the shaft. Spansion filed for bankrupty this week, chapter 11.
Micronas felt that they didn't have enough of a customer base to justify
qualifying a replacement flash vendor.

That is the reason that I have abandonned all work on this and I am so
pissed off at those assholes...

More reason in the future to stick with vendors that have their own
flash like ST and Atmel.

Michel
