<PRE>ok than, I've done some more testing with real RLink this time. the 
results are exactly the same as for Primer1 - so generaly RLink works 
fine now...

BTW - RLink is pretty slow... compared to my FT2232 based JTAG it is 
exactly 5 times slower (i compare the time of 100k code upload, same 
jtag_khz, same target - cortex-m3). with standard 1MHz speed, the upload 
speed is about 1kB/s, and with FT2232 based interface it is 5-6kB/s.

upload is just a minor issue, as you don't upload that much code with 
JTAG that offen, but - stepping through code, or pausing the core is 
pretty laggy too. what I mean is that 1 step usually takes about 5-10 
(up to 20 sometimes while in ISRs) seconds with RLink (and that is 
annoying), while with FT2232 it is 'a blink of the eye (which is not 
annoying at all).

i also get some mystical errors and warns almost all the time in the 
background:

Error: SWJ-DP STICKY ERROR
Error: dcb_dhcsr 0x30003, nvic_shcsr 0x20800, nvic_cfsr 0x0, nvic_bfar 
0xe000edf8
Warn : Block read error address 0x4e306078, count 0x1

exactly the same code with the same target but with FT2232 gives the 
same errors and warns all the time, but the steps take 4-5sec max 
(usually about 2-3sec), and there is no significant difference when 
stepping through the ISR.

Anyway - a great step has been made, as now both primer and real RLink 
are supported and are operational!

4\/3!!
