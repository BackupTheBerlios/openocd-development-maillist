<PRE>So - I guess the next step with OMAP - aka: CortexA8 is to figure out 
how the DAP interface works.
The existing dap code - well - It's a bit confusing to me, and has such 
wonderful documentation.

=======

I'm thinking that adding a &quot;dap&quot; command will be helpful - for both 
Cortex M3 - and A8.  Any objections? Who knows a lot about this dap 
thing? I'd like to ask a number of questions... what should the command 
look like? What features/options should it have?

=======

Specifically - I'm looking at ARM IHI 0031A - Figure 2-2, page 2-9, PDF 
page 45. There's this nice diagram that shows the 5 basic registers in 
the DAP. I think having a command line exploration tool/command would be 
very helpful. Any agreement?

=======

Next, item is figuring out how the DAP is configured in the A8 - and 
which 'ports' are implemented. on this beast, ie: What access points out 
of the DAP are implemented. In the M3 - it seems nicely documented This 
part, I'm a bit confused about. Are you? Anybody else? The diagram 
(figure 2-2 above for the M3) shows a &quot;SELECT&quot; register... offset 8 in 
the DPACC range, the output of which becomes the APSEL (access port 
select).  Hence, my idea of having a &quot;dap&quot; command that lets one 
experiment and figure things out. Ideas/Suggestions? Objections?

=====

It seems, that we need to look at address 0xffc - in the &quot;rom table&quot; and 
work backwards from there, ie: See IHI 0031A - section 1.2.3, And - 
section 13.2 - the CID0 to CID3 registers... should lets us &quot;walk&quot; the 
register tables. however, it seems the cortex_swjdp.c - seems to be some 
what &quot;purpose built&quot; for the M3. Agree? Or am I missing something?

=====

My guess the &quot;jtag-acces-port&quot; interface is not one that is implemented, 
but is documented in IHI 0031A, ie: section 2.2.1
this would be used for things internal that are Jtag type devices - 
which don't exist.

-Duane.
