Indeed, but I still think that the locus of the investigation will be the 
adapter-specific code.

I did a 'scope trace using the USBprog adapter, but the 'scope has had to 
go back to work :-(. OK, I didn't count the 2030, but the code in 
xscale_deassert_reset() does jtag_add_runtest(2030, TAP_IDLE), and the 
XScale documentation specifies 2030 TCKs after reset before loading the 
mini-ICache.

Sadly, also, I don't have an Olimex-JTAG-Tiny (the working one) here 
either. The trace for that was done by someone else, half a world away, on 
an identical target board. So, I can't do direct comparisons unless 
someone can lend me an Olimex.

However, it's not directly after the 2030 TCKs that it goes wrong. All 
adapters successfully then do a transaction with DCSR, which involves 
loading IR with 0x9, checking the Capture IR reponse (=0x01), moving to 
DRSHIFT, and reading/writing the DCSR register. Then all adapters 
successfully (I think) load the debug handler into the mini-ICache, and 
write DCSR again.

This write to DCSR should then let the target run (the debug code just 
loaded into the cache), and then the next read is from TX, which the debug 
handler should have written to. However, the 3 guard bits in 
fields[0].in_value[3] should be 010 or 011 (from the hardware), and they 
aren't, which is why I think it's an extra bit clocked somewhere.

Many thanks for taking an interest.
