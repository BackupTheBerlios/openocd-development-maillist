There are TWO methods: 

(A) programing a spi flash - like Xilinx does with their dongle, for use 
with an FPGA configuration. 
(B) Download a small &quot;helper program&quot; to the target, and then 
downloading the data to that helper program.

Which do you plan on doing?

To date, OpenOCD has never done (A) - I'm planning on doing exactly that 
fairly soon.

Method (B) has not to date been done with SPI flash, it has been done 
with standard flash of all types. See the &quot;run algorithim&quot; routines as 
examples. The other primary reason why (B) has not been done, is that 
every single chip has a different SPI flash controller, and every board 
has yet another SPI flash configuration {Did you use GPIO for the CS 
pin, and which one?}.

If you plan on (B) please think of the host side operation in &quot;generic 
terms&quot;, as a semi-spi master.  I have some ideas, but will not be back 
online till tonight.

&gt;<i> This patch might be a bit controversial around one of the changes I 
</I>&gt;<i> made, but I think it's right since it brings OpenOCD in-line with the 
</I>&gt;<i> actual source documents from ARM.  I also sort of made it a bit easier 
</I>&gt;<i> to grok state transitions, and that might be a little controversial as 
</I>&gt;<i> well.
</I>
Sounds interesting. Thanks
