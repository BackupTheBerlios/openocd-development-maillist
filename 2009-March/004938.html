and that is exactly what i did - removed two screws, took out the pcb 
and drew a sch out of what i saw. it was pretty easy, as the pcb has two 
layers and all the components are on the top side.

you cannot do the RLink out of that sch, because some minor stuff can be 
wrong (RLink is much more than just an ARM JTAG) - i didn't pay extreme 
attention to stuff that is useless for ARMs. You would still need the 
firmware for the ST7 to do that (;

if that is questionable, i suppose that i can just use words to describe 
that - where the JTAG lines are connected, but that would be pretty much 
the same as posting the sch [; to be honest, the RLink protocol is 
pretty much the effect of rev. engineering and intercepting the USB 
transmissions, and RLink is supported based on that info.

now it could be supported fully, not just the Primer.

4\/3!!
