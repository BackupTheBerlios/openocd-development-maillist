</I>&gt;<i> Weird.  I think I might be able (using PB5 for feedback) to figure out
</I>&gt;<i> whether the adapter is a standalone RLink or a Primer and change the
</I>&gt;<i> initialization and reset code to do the right thing.  So far, I haven't
</I>&gt;<i> figured out how to do that without spuriously asserting SRST as a side
</I>&gt;<i> effect of the test.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The schematic for the Primer2 agrees with what you said about PA5
</I>&gt;<i> connecting to PB5.  Maybe somebody made an error with the Primer1 and
</I>&gt;<i> just went with it.  I could guess all day, but it would do little good.
</I>&gt;<i> The Primer2, since it uses SWD and not JTAG, tells us nothing about
</I>&gt;<i> RTCK.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, to say the same thing a different way; on Primer1, PA3 is SRST and
</I>&gt;<i> PA5 is NC.  On a standalone RLink, PA3 is RTCK and PA5 is SRST.  In either
</I>&gt;<i> case, PB5 is connected to SRST.  Is all of that correct?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If there is no way to test which PA pin is SRST without spuriously
</I>&gt;<i> asserting SRST, I'll need another way of making the identification.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe the serial code will help.  My Primer1 has &quot;dngWNYe&quot; followed by 8
</I>&gt;<i> numeric digits.  It could be that those 7 characters contain information
</I>&gt;<i> about the dongle, and might tell us which line SRST is supposed to be.
</I>&gt;<i> Either that, or it's an opaque string which means nothing other than
</I>&gt;<i> it's an RLink, which would be of no help for this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The rlink driver in OpenOCD doesn't currently provide for printing the
</I>&gt;<i> serial code, but I can certainly add something to print it when
</I>&gt;<i> debugging output is requested.  Windows users can, of course, use RIDE
</I>&gt;<i> (or its underlying tools) to get it.  So if you or someone else can
</I>&gt;<i> reply with the serial for one or more standalone RLinks, that might be
</I>&gt;<i> helpful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Further, since the Primer2 seems to have similar SRST wiring to the
</I>&gt;<i> standalone RLink, I'd like to see a serial from one of those as well if
</I>&gt;<i> any of your are in a position to be able to provide it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd hate to have the type of RLink (Primer1 or standalone) be something
</I>&gt;<i> that has to be specified in a config file.  I'd rather be able to autodetect.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;/ i've got the full schematic, but it needs some arranging, cleaning and
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ other stuff, so it will be 100% ready in the evening. in the meantime -
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ will that be illegal to post that on the list? (; maybe i should send it
</I>&gt;<i> /&gt;/ just to Lou, not to the whole list?
</I>&gt;<i> /
</I>&gt;<i> However it ends up getting to me, I look forward to seeing it.
</I>Just ask Raisonance. If you did not get reply, get an other JTAG dongle !
