&gt;<i> Uh-oh.  The rlink driver was created based on the schematic for the
</I>&gt;<i> Primer1, which contains an Rlink chip.  The standalone Rlink device has
</I>&gt;<i> circuitry that the Primer does not.  I made the best guesses I could,
</I>&gt;<i> based on USB traffic traces, to accomodate the additional unknown
</I>&gt;<i> hardware.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, I do not have a standalone RLink dongle which I could use
</I>&gt;<i> for testing or to open up to trace out the missing parts of the
</I>&gt;<i> circuit.  I recall Rob saying he was getting one with which to do some
</I>&gt;<i> testing, but I haven't been in contact with him in awhile.
</I>
as the RLink is pretty easy to disassemble, I can try helping with that
case. I suppose that the Primer1 sch is the one in the official
documentation, so I'll try to draw a sch of the real rlink. or maybe you
just need some specific info, maybe just the reset lines part?

&gt;<i> The good news is that the part of the driver that twiddles the non TAP
</I>&gt;<i> lines is not too hard to understand.  The bad news is that there may be
</I>&gt;<i> some driver (or level shifter) enable that I have no idea about, and
</I>&gt;<i> which obviously isn't present in the Primer.
</I>
that is very likely! the voltage on the SRST line is about 0.15V - not
zero! - so it may be some disabled circuitry.

write me what you need and I will provide whatever help that would be
required to make openocd better.

4\/3!!
