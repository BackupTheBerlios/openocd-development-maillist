<PRE>[oops - I did not CC' the list - I goofed]

-Duane.

Jeff&gt; Any thoughts on my patch?  I'm happy to work through why I made
the changes I made.

Sorry - been busy..

-Duane.

In general - looks good.

We should break the changes up a little bit. Smaller change sets are
less messy.

1)   for a commit - 'experimental code' needs to not be present.
   no big deal at this stage of the game.
    that or - tell us more about what's going on here.

2)  jtag/jtag.h. changing state numbers concerns me - but i see
*exactly* why you are doing this.
    Perhaps this sort of stuff would have helped earlier with the beagle
board work.
    And it looks like a good idea.

    I'd like others to comment also.
    (*HEY* anybody else reading this?*)

    ie: ?DIRK/DICK? I forget who - wrote quite a bit of stuff with an
SVF playback
    code to do xilinx stuff.  I'd hate to break that...

3) the state numbers - could you put a better reference in.
Example: The state numbers are from:
    Document: ARM 7TDMI Technical Reference Manual
    Revision:   R4P1
    Section:  B.1.2
    Arm Document ID Number: DDI 0210C

4)   The B8(), and B8__() macros are a cool trick!

5)   Lots of thumb clean up code - I've not used much thumb code.
    You probably found a number of issues :-)
    I guess you are doing everything in THUMB mode eh?
    I've found a few issues too.

    What's going on? Can you explain more about this part of your changes?

6)   Your &quot;Debug state machine()&quot; - in jlink.c - looks useful for other
things :-)
    Is that really just dis-assembling the command byte stream to the jlink?

7) Why the &quot;10 second&quot; - vrs 1 second timeout in arm7_9_common.c?
     Is this because you are running the jtag clock slow? Or is this
something else?
    Is it the jtag clock rate?  Or are you trying to do a lot of stuff?
    10 seconds is an eternity to somebody who does not know/understand
what is going on and causes confusion.
    ie: Human Factors, nothing technical ...

8)  Longer term issue - is host byte order - ie: the hard coded ARM NOP
you added: &quot;default_nop_out&quot;
