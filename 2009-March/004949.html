<PRE>Hi Duane,

Good catch! As always, RTFM :)

I set the signal analyzer to catch the condition that you described ((rising TCK) and (high RTCK)). See attached screenshot. This was with TCK set to 5 kHz. As several people pointed out, TCK (jtag_khz) is too fast.

I checked the Atmel AT91SAM9260 datasheet and the internal &quot;32 kHz&quot; RC oscillator can vary between 22 and 42 kHz. This means that a safe jtag_khz speed to use is 3 kHz and this worked.

A minor inconvenience is that at this slow speed, the following message is emitted twice by OpenOCD during reset:

BUG: keep_alive() was not invoked in the 1000ms timelimit. GDB alive packet not sent! (2057)

Best regards,
Pieter

P.S. When I have some more time, I will look into the NRST pulse at 25% of the screen.

P.S.S. I have a second hand Janatek / Jobmatch Systems Lu-La-Usb Logic Analyzer (www.janatek.co.za).

See attached screenshots. There is an anomaly with RTCK on the first TCK pulse (see &quot;ScreenShot0004.png&quot;), but I don't know if this is a problem.

Pieter,

See FAQ #1 in the documentation

        <A HREF="http://openocd.berlios.de/doc/FAQ.html#FAQ">http://openocd.berlios.de/doc/FAQ.html#FAQ</A>

I see two anomalies,

(1) a small pulse on rtck when reset is released - To be expected,
(screenshot 002)

(2) What is this pulse on NRST? about at about 25% of the screen?

But you speak about screen shot 004 -  The clock TCK/RTCK sequence shown
in screenshot004 seems border line.
The left side of the screen seems ok...

You might set your timing analyzer up to look for this error condition,

     ((rising TCK) and (high RTCK))  *or*  ((falling TCK) and (low RTCK))

And sample at some *HIGH* speed - ie: 1mhz w/5khz jtag clock.

Q: who makes your timing analyzer? It seems better then the cheap one I
purchased.

-Duane.
